52F4E96E8282,"Using cars creates admissions that damages our ozone layer. Communities around the world know this and are doing something to relax the damage being done. They are doing temporary bans on cars along side with other cities, and trying to make cars with much lower emissions.

Using cars in major cities makes it so noisy but also makes it very bad for the environment, and ourselfs. When you live in a major city like for example New York City, people choose to walk rather than drive cars. Not only is this healthier for us but it is much more healthy for the rest of the environment.

In suburban Germany there is a town that has banned cars from the street completely and has most people riding bikes and walking. Most of these people dont really car so much about having to walk or ride a bike. In Colombia they had one day where they banned cars and in their city of 7 million people, most people walked or rode bikes. Germany and Paraguay arent the only nationd that are taking a part of this, other nations like France, and other eurpoean countries are joining in. President Obama has also pushed for cars with lower emissions and higher gas mileage. This will help save people money if they dont really have it, and help save the amount of gas used and emissions caused.

With all this in mind it would be useful to lower gas emissions or even to stop using cars in general. It will be healthy for us and the environent. We dont even have to get rid over cars completly either, we can just switch over to electric. Theses are easy solutions to our problem, and also giving us and advantage in the world we live in.

71DFA360D5EC,"I believe the author article can be supported with his/her study and details. In my option I think that trying to explore further into the idea of entering Venus's atmosphere might be dangerous; however, it could lead to a whole new story and new exploration. Taking the time to figure a way to land on Venus safely will take time, the technology and spaceship that would be used to enter Venus atmosphere will need to be excellant, and it might take risk on peoples lives trying to enter and explore a whole new planet.

Scientist often referr Earth's ""Twin"" as Venus because it is the closest plalnet to Earth in terms of density and size, quoted in paragraph 2. If Venus is very similar to Earth, it could mean that life could live on Venus such as how life lives on Earth to this day. ""Long ago, Venus was probably cover largely wit oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth"" (Paragraph 4). This shows that scientist have perdicted theories over Venus and are still currently trying to solve and prove their theory. Finding a way to get to Venus is the problem we have here on Earth. In the text it states ""Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours"" (paragraph 2). This shows that Venus is very different than the Planet we live on and it will take time to create a space shuttle that is well fit to enter Venus's atmospere.

The technology and spaceshuttles have not been made or designed to enter an atmosphere so powerful yet. ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus"" (paragraph 3). The information that scientists are finding on Venus is amazing and will help other scientist find ways to design a spaceshuttle to get through the blanket of Venus. Venus has a very hot surface level of 90 times greater than the surface level than the Earth. We need to discover a way to allow our spaceships to under go the high pressure that it would have to go through to enter Venus.

NASA has one issue that they struggle on besides buildling the spaceships that they would want to send to Venus. That struggle is sending a human to Venus, and not knowing what will happen on the trip there. Is it worth risking a life to explore or not sending anyone and forget about this whole experiment? If I had to pick, my answer would be Yes. I believe that finding a new Planet that life could live on just like Earth could continue the species of mankind. No man has under gone more pressure than the Earth's atmosphere, and Venus atmosphere could destroy anything that we create that enters its atmosphere including a human if we sent them.

In conclusin, I believe it is worth continuing to study and figure a way to have a spaceshuttle land in the planet of Venus. Eventually when it is safe and we have solved how to create a safe space shuttle that a human can survive and enter Venus. Being able to explore Venus and find ways to live on the planet could start a new way of life for mankind. ",0,0.008204563,0,True
B29CFA250576,"Ancient civilizations like Rome, Egypt, and Greece have all had something in common that allowed them to survive through the ages and leave their imprint in history. Education and learning has been at the base of every society as it's important to always be progressing; even education itself has progressed through out time. Great thinkers like Plato and Arestotle influenced the discussions of many and continue to do so; however, knowledge is more accesible now and is regarded as a necessity for the masses in most countries. A way that schools are reaching more students is by taking advantage of technology. Online classes and video conferenicng has become increasingly popular. Although it's dangerous to rely so heavily on technology, online school and video conferenicng is a positive thing as many adults who wish to seek higher education ,but are too busy, use this method, people with anxiety issues can learn from the safety of their homes, and it can even be used as a backup plan for when there is a hinderance in the physical school.

Most people are engulfed by their day to day life and responsibilties like their jobs and families. By taking advanatge of online courses and video conferencing, these adults are able to fufill their duties as well as work torwards their goals! A common demographic that uses this method is teachers! While most attend college for four years and get certified in order to enter the work force faster, some decide to persue a higher degree such as a masters or even a Phd. However, not everyone has that luxury. A higher degree typically means higher pay, which incentivizes these proffesionals to enroll in classes. Even more important are classes that work around their schedule. All while working for a better future such as the Physics, AP US history, and other teachers here at Generic_School.

While conserving time and energy is important, conserving mental health is just as critical. There is a high statistic of students that suffer from anxiety, depression, and bullying. These conditions can put a damper on grades and social life, not to mention self esteem. These issues are not new, except now students have an alternative. Mental health has been increasinly gaining traction in schools as they try to make the students feel safer, although it's not always effective. A well known youtuber named Antonio Garza has talked about her struggles in high school, such as a lack of motivation to do anything, usually asscociated with depression, and the anxiety of being in a room where they are being judged. By choosing to leave daily public high school in favor of online courses, she has been able to feel more liberated and reduced their anxiety that comes as a result of large groups. Many teenagers and adults alike can relate to these problems personally.

Traditional school that takes place is a physical building is preferred by many, but what happens when the physical building is not available or being avoided? Covid-19, better known as the Corona Virus, has paralyzed the world, specially east asian countries. School children are being told not to come to school for their own safety. The World Health organization cannot be sure of when this ordeal will be over; thus, immobilizing the education system for an unknown period of time. Thankfully, there are many apps and programs that schools have been using to keep the lessons afloat. Video conferencing and virtual worksheets have made this time of distress feel relatively normal to school children all throughout the affected regions, until it can actually go back to normal.

From the distant times of Plato and Arestotle to the common era, learning has always been placed on a pedestal. New forms and methods of education are always being born. A popular option being online classes and conferencing which have already made a difference for adults and teenagers alike in time management, accomodation for mental health, as well as a rampant illness right now. While technology is a good thing, it's important to acknowledge too much of anything can be intoxicating. Overall, school systems and people everywhere can benefit from these ingenious programs! ",0,0.00934257,0,True
9EBEC441D6E2,"The development of these cars have both many posituve and nevative things to them. They can really help the future in ways that kigjt nkt be possible at this time. In my opinion i tyink that these cars would be a bad idea, because there are mire bad thungs that could happen than good things.

Some people might just say they are good for the future without knowing the consequences for any possible accidents.

One reason why these cars would not be good woukd be if there is an old person that can not drive they could consider one of these cars. The problem is that if it is time for the driver to take over the car and if the driver does not know how to drive, this would lead to a problem. Accidents could occur if non drivers are in the car. It could lead to a critical stage of punishment in case you are in a fatal crash or get stopped by the police.

My other argument is that these cars could potentially stop working if they do not have proper items for this car.

Most people arent going to have the right things for this car, if they crash the car might not function the same and proper way of how its supposed to work. This car could break down for no reason.

I feel like these cars would be more helpful in some way but you also need to look at the negative things of this. Every positive thing always has a negative thing also.

There are going to be consequences if the car is not used right. It might not be affordable for most people either.  ",0,0.0071844794,0,True
0CB2758A3289,"Many teachers decide to assign summer projects over the break however there is some discussion to be had over whether these projects should be designed by teachers or by students.

There are many things to consider about the idea of summer projects and what is needed to be gained through them.

While students my be more creative designing their projects, summer projects should still be designed y the teacher because, teachers know the class content better, have history of making projects, and understand what the students need to gain from their projects to do well in class.

To start things off, teachers know the content better.

Unlike students teachers have gone through at least some sort of higher education to be able to teach the class.

More than likely some of that was focused on the subject the teachers instructs.

For example my history teacher went to college to study American history.

This makes her more qualified than me to teach and assign projects.

Since the teachers have received more years of education than the student in the subject they will more than likely assign a project that gets across the necessary material for the class than the students.

Secondly most teachers have taught the class for more than a year.

With this experience they are able to know more than the students because they have heard more insight on the class information and discussed the same topic with multiple groups of students.

With this experience they have a better understanding of the best way for it to be conveyed to the students, allowing them to design a better summer project.

Secondly, teachers have a longer history with projects than their students.

Teachers at one point were students and were educated in almost all cases to a higher degree than their students.

Through this they are able to experience more types of projects and draw ideas in from their former teachers to design projects that a student might not even think of because they have more experience than the students.

Through this if any of the students become teachers the have one more idea for a project than they would have otherwise.

Moreover, teachers have assigned different projects throughout the years and know what works and what doesn't.

A teacher will be able to know if a certain type of project works because they have likely given the same project to another group of students.

Some teachers also go to training to help design projects.

For example my German teacher was out for two days at a conference solely pertaining to project ideas for their students.

With this history and background teachers know what works and what doesn't something that other students haven't been able to experience making them better summer project designers.

Lastly, teachers understand what the students need to gain from the project more than other students.

Teachers as stated earlier have more than likely taught the class for more than one year.

This gives them the ability to know how the students need gain the intended knowledge from the project.

The teacher has seen other students go though the same project and can modify it over the years they are teaching so the students are able to gain more from the project. than if another student designed it.

Another reason is teachers know what they want to teach more than any student would.

If a teacher has a large focus on the civil rights movement than they can assign a project with a specific focus on the civil rights movement.

It allows teachers to assign projects that will, in the log run, be more useful to the students.

To conclude teachers are better summer project designers than students because teachers have had a higher education and know the content better than the students, they have longer history with projects and project design, and they understand what the students need to gain from the class better than another student.

Summer projects are very important in no only learning but also getting to know a teacher.

So while students do have some merit as project designers, teachers should design summer project because of the importance of the project and the important information it needs to convey. ",0,0.0064718765,0,True
9f45f83a,"The Electoral College has been in the Constitution since out founding fathers established it. It was an agreement between election of the President by a vote in congress and election of President by a popular vote of citizens.

As we all know the Electoral College is a process which is the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and counting of the electoral votes by Congress. There are two political parties. Democrats and Republicans. Electors are usually chosen by the person running for office's political party, but each state has their different views on how they are selected and what their responsibilities are. When the time comes, usually every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, presidential elections are held. This is the day citizens go out to their local polls and help their electors vote for President. It's not the citizens themselves who vote for the President, when citizens vote they're actually voting for their candidates electors. The process of the Electoral College has been carried on since it was first put into the constitution. So, why change it now?

The Electoral College consists of over 538 electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. The citizens vote sometime in November in polls and wait for the election of the new President. As stated before, the citizens vote does not elect the president, it helps the electors choose. However, that doesn't mean that the citizens don't have a purpose in voting. Popular vote is part of an election as well. It is rare that the Electoral College is higher in numbers that its popular votes. This is sometimes because states award electoral votes on a winnertakesall rubric.

This process requires a candidate to have transregional appeal, meaning there aren't favorites. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This also means the presidential candidate will not gain any electoral votes by increasing his popularity in states they know they'll win in. This is a highly unlikely result that will outcome as a successful president. If this were to occur, voters in other states would feel discouraged and feel as if their votes do not count. This is why the Electoral College has this as a requirement.

In most tossup states, voters are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign and deciding or knowing who that they will decide to be president. They are most likely thoughtful voters and are perferred to be the ones to decide the election. In big states, the Electoral College adjusts the weight in the political balance that these states lose by population. In additon, large states get more attention of candidates in a campaign that the smaller states do.

These are just few of many resons why the Electoral college should stay as is. If they were to change the Electoral College, what would they do to elect a president? It would be chaotic and the people may rebel. In conclusion, keeping the Electoral College as it is should be the only process to elect a president.",0,0.007194619,0,True
BFEC74473FC2,"Even though the Electoral College is known as a disaster factor, it has its benefits. The Electoral College is a process that consists of the selection of the electors. Each candidate running in your state has his or her own group of electors that are voted for. When you vote on election day, which is held every four years on Tuesday after the first Monday in Novemeber, you vote for the candidate's electors. Many politicians wanted to abolish the Electoral College because of its lack of democratic pedigree, but the college doesn't allow voters of other regions to feel disenfranchised, it avoids run-off elections, and thinks that the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.

The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have a trans-regional appeal. It would not be fair for a candidate to campaign heavily in a state that they know they are going to win. This does not gain them any electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows will win. This causes voters that are from the opposite region to feel as if their votes did not count, that their new president would not care about their interests or values. The president would not really be their president because of the fact that they were ignored.

Voters that are more likely to pay attention to the campaign by listening to each opposing sides that compete against one another should decide the election. If voters that voted didn't care and picked the weaker candidate, then everyone would pay the price. The knowledgable voters listen to the competing candidates and will receive the most information and attention from the candidates. This leads to a candidate worthy enough to become president, which will choose the country's decisions for the next four years.

Run-off elections, where elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast is avoided. There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast, which complicates the presidential election process, but is reduced by the Electoral College to announce a clear winner. The run-off election once happened to Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992.

Many argue the fact that the Electoral College method may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope for carrying their state. People knowing their vote will have no effect, will have less intentions of paying attention to the election then they would have if the president picked the popular vote. Voter's in presidential elections are people who want to express a political reference and want the best for their country's future rather than people who think one vote may decide the election and disregard the point of voting.                       ",0,0.009708568,0,True
2F95EA7A9F3B,"Throughout the school year, ""You guys should have learned this last year"" is a common phrase heard from all teachers.

Students every year come into the new school year not knowing or remembering any of the prior information they had digested the previous year.

This can be extremely difficult, not just for the students, but for the teachers who have to reteach the information that the students already learned.

In order to prevent this, teachers issue summer projects to keep the students' minds ripe and ready to learn.

The real question is if these projects requirements should be dictated by the teachers or the students.

Teacher-designed projects would work best because they would be more challenging to the students, they would be able to learn something new, and teachers can design the project so that students are starting out with the sufficient amount of information that they need going into the new school year.

The issue with a student designing their own summer project is that it will most likely lack creativity or maximum use of their intelligence to complete.

They might just end up picking an easy topic just so they could get a good grade and move on with their summer.

While students should use the summer as a break from school, if a summer assignment is assigned, than it should be designed with the student's intelligence in mind.

Teacher-designed projects would insure that students use their intelligence to the fullest.

The topic would be more ""brain teasing"" and students would have to use their full effort rather than half doing it.

This would ensure that students don't slack off or attempt to take the easy way out of their assignment.

Students could also learn something that they never knew about before during their summer break.

Rather than doing a project on something that they already have knowledge of, they could learn new information that could prepare them for the next school year.

This would push the student out of their circle of knowledge, forcing them to take in new information.

Or they could learn the same information, just expanded upon.

It's like how in elementary school, students just learned the basics of history and geography, but going into middle school and high school, the information learned is way more in depth and extremely detailed.

Students could be interested by how much more their is to the subject than just the basics.

In theory, it could become more ""fun"" for the student to learn about.

In correlation with students having teacher-designed projects, the requirements to the projects can ensure that students learn the necessary amount of information they need to start off in the new school year.

If a project is designed to cater towards the necessary knowledge needed, they'll know about the subject rather than having to relearn everything from last year in order to catch up.

Doing teacher designed projects during the break ensures that students will go into the new year having some semblance of knowledge on the subject, rather than knowing nothing at all.

Through a teacher-designed project, students will know what they need to know in preparation for the next school year.

It's good for a student to have the baseline of what they need to know so that they won't go into the school year knowing absolutely nothing.

Teacher-designed projects are the best way to go.

While it would be nice to encourage students to use their own creativity in coming up with their own project, most would half do the project just so they could enjoy their breaks.

With a teacher-designed project, the student's focus would be on doing the project well.

Teacher-designed projects are the better option because they would challenge a student's intelligence, they could learn new information that they've never known before, and teachers could design the project so as to better prepare their students for the new school year.",0,0.006950605,0,True
A4836DDF5863,"Have you ever heard of ""the Face""?

The Face is something that is a landform on Mars that looks just like a face.

Some people think that the face was created by Aliens.

This isn't true.

There is much evidence that this is false.

It is a natural landform.

So question is what would you say if you were a scientist at NASA that knows that ""the Face"" is a natural landform and you were talking to someone that thinks that ""the Face"" was created by Aliens.

3 reasons that I would mention are that the face is made of rock, pictures show that it is a landform, and that it looks like landforms like a mesa or a butte.

""The"" Face is made of rock.

The article ""Unmaskng the Face on Mars"" states that...

""A few days later NASA unvelied the image for all to see.

The caption noted a 'huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.'""

Aliens didn't create rock.

And as the essay clearly shows ""the Face is obviously made of rock.

So that is part of the proof that ""the Face"" is a landform.

You can also tell that the Face is a landform through pictures.

Another reason that ""the Face"" is a landform is that the pictures show that it is a landform.

The article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" shows pictures that show that ""the Face"" is clearly a landform.

In the pictures you can tell that this is a landform.

""The Face"" also looks like a mesa or a butte.

They are so many reasons that ""The Face is a landform.

Another one of the reasons is that ""the Face"" looks exactly like a mesa or a butte.

The article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" states that...

""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West.

'It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,' says Garvin.

'That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.'""

This also definitely proves that ""the Face"" is a landform not something that Aliens created and left there for some reason.

God created everything the way it is and for a purpose.

He put that rock landform thing there for a reason to show us how powerful God is and that he can do anything.

God created the world just how it is and that is how he wants it with His ""intelligent design""

We talked about how since ""the Face"" is made of rock, pictures show that it is a landform, and how it looks like landforms that it is a lanform.

This is what I would tell someone who thought that Aliens created ""the Face"".

Aliens didn't create ""the Face"".

God did for a purpose using His ""intelligent design"".

He did this to show us that He is very powerful and that He can do anything.

I hope that this will help strengthen a lot of people's Faith in God.

By writing this essay I hope to do more than just answer the prompt and get a good score.

I hope to also inform people about God and what He can do.                              ",0,0.0071545937,0,True
BEEE3AC55C0E,"Some of the world's greatest inventions would not exist without collaboration. Do you think that Steve Jobs started the increasingly popular brand, Apple, all by himself? We have all asked someone for advice at some point in our life, since getting insight from other people makes life a lot easier. But is it really the more the merrier when it comes to giving and receiving advice? I think that seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because you can make more people happy, someone could catch something another person missed, and certain people specialize in different things.

One reason why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is you can make more people happy. If you only talk to one person, you are only getting insight from that person's point of view. But by talking to multiple people, you will get a better perspective on what most people want so you can make more people happy. One example of this is a wedding. Say you are planning a wedding but you don't know whether to serve chocolate cake or vanilla cake. If you only ask one of the guests what flavor they want, you will not know if you are making multiple people happy because do don't have their opinion. But if you survey everyone on what cake they want, you will see everyone's opinion. Therefore, you can make a better choice and make more people happy.

Another reason why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is someone could catch something another person missed. By asking just one person for advice, you could miss something very important that another person would notice. If you are making a big decision, that extra opinion could change your life forever. For example, say you are debating what college to go to, NYU, or Stanford. After asking one person for advice, you decided you want to go to NYU. But by asking another person for advice, you realized that NYU does not have what you want to major in and you go to Stanford. By asking multiple people, you will make sure that you are not missing anything important.

The final reason why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is certain people specialize in different things. If you only ask one person for their opinion, they might not know what to do as well as someone else who specializes in the thing you are asking about. Say you are planning to build a pool in your backyard. By only asking an architect, you will know how to make the pool functional, but you will not know what shaped pool is best, what concrete you should use, or where in the backyard is best for the pool to go. But by asking a designer too, you would have a better looking pool since they specialize in making things look good on the outside.

These are the reasons why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. In this generation, people are collaborating more and more. But without people giving and receiving advice, we would not have all these miraculous advances in technology, fashion, agriculture, and more. Because you can make more people happy, someone could catch something another person missed, and certain people specialize in different things, asking multiple people for advice can help someone make a better choice.",0,0.0075324867,0,True
482DB8018CBA,"Why we should use our phones while driving

Many may say that using cellphones while driving is dangerous and that the shouldn't be used while driving, but actually there are more pros than cons. You have apps now that let you use your phone while driving without actually touching your phone. Its pure fact that if not many but all teens that are in school and driving stress about school, life, etc. With students and people in general stressing, They may lead to hit and runs and cameras on phones can clearly help identify or capture the drivers or their licenses plate.

While many may complain about how driving while using your phone is dangerous and this and that, they probably have been living under a rock for the past couple of years because there has been this new feature that has been around for a couple years now it called ,hands-free feature. It lets you do about everything you would be capable of doing if you were actually touching and your phone. On the website ""drivingschool. net"", they stated that ""a hands free mobile phone can minimize such issue, allowing driver to make calls without taking their eyes off the road or their hands off the wheel.""

Hit and Run drivers do exist. On the website ""newsroom. aaa. com"" they claimed that,"" Hit-and-Runs deaths in the US have increased an average of 7.2 percent each year since 2009."" The cameras on phones allow for drivers to take pictures of license plate numbers. In the past year its been reported that the percentage from 8% to 12% and those where from how many Hit-and-Runs where caught in only 2019.

Yes, although many people have stated that teenagers get distracted while driving due to their phones its also proven that using phones while driving driving may be beneficial. People love to complaining and talk about how teenagers get distracted while driving due to their phones but they always bring up the irresponsible one or the more reckless ones as an example. There are people that drive perfectly fine and are capable of using their phones that exist. Many people don't like bringing those type of people up because they want to make a point.

As i've been stating now this entire time, yes using your phone while driving may be beneficial but its also dangerous. So im not stating that you need to starting doing it always just when neccessary . Using your phone while driving may be useful but remember your safety comes first.

The first reason the author gave us on why we should land on Venus is that it will meet the very edges of are imaginations. What the other means by this is thed human body is always thinking about what is out there in space. By putting humans on Venus this can give us an answer to are imangination and maybe make us think even more about what is out there.

Not only does the author say it will meet the very edges of are imaginations he also says ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by it will meet the very edges of are imaginationsenus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity. What the author means by this is he is showing that we are never not wondering. We will always be wanting to do something that will answer a question that we have. For example, ""i wonder what this book is about"". what you would do is read the book. Just like how we wonder what Venus is like. We want to land on it.

D941EA296360,"Dear principal,

I agree with policy 1 because i say that is good to use our phones during lunch periods and at other free times but are phones have to be turned off during class time.

We should be able to use our phones and when we get back to class turn them off for we wont interrupt the class, our classmates, and our teachers. If after that lunch period is finished and other free times are done and we get back to class and if we don't have our phones turned off they could take our phones for not turning them off during class time.

What the teachers can do if they see that we have our phones on in class they could take them away, give it to the principal, give it to us after a few days or let our parents come and pick up our phones. The teachers could take them away and not give them back to us until the end of the day or the next day. If the teachers gives it to the principal we could fill out a paper where it says that we got our phone taken away and we have that paper filled in more than five times we cant bring our phones to school anymore. what they could also do is to give to us after a few days or let our parents come and pick it up to the office.

I think that our principal should gives us a chance to try this to see how we do. If it doesn't work well we will just go back to the way that was before. But i think that if we get the chance we will listen that the only time that we have to use our phones is during lunch periods and other free times.

d168e4bc,"Cars, they're one of the most important means of transportation, varying from busses down to smart cars. The more cars being bought and used, the more pollution it makes. Researchers are saying that cars, their dense amount of smog being created, are damaging the Earth. Logically, it would be easier to say that limiting the amount of vehicles being used would allow for a cleaner city or town.

Limiting car usage in the past and present already shows a positive feed back upon the community. There has been cities dedicated to create a carfree city. An example would be in Vauban, Germany. There the city runs purely on no car usage and showed to be much cleaner, safer, and easier to navigate around in. It says in the first passage how the city is ""...better for walking..."" and that it is ""...more compact and more accessible to public transportation..."" In other areas, where car usage is an everyday expense, they have started to enforce driving bans to reduce pollution in the area. In Paris, they almost reached nearrecord pollution which reduced greatly ever since the ban. They limited the use of cars has cleaned the air and their ""congestion"" was down 60 percent allowing getting around easier. Although having car free cities and bans, others thing differently.

Others, whom oppose the idea of limiting cars use, has done research to show that it isn't necessary to limit car usage. They state that in America ""Americans are buying fewer and fewer cars"" They claim that the drop of purchasing and that the usage of cars is dropping to the point where pollution won't raise up anymore. In source 4, it states ""If the patterns persists it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment"" It also states that people will ""find less reason to resume the habit"" Although some advantages are seen in the opposing ideas, it still would not be enough. The passage focuses to much in one area instead of looking around. Limiting car usage would assist around the world proving to be much efficient. There are programs that are created to reduce the usage of cars for one day, which showed to be a success. In source 3 it shows how 118 miles of bicycle paths has been created since the day. Also shows how the day cut traffic and allowed for constructions of new buildings to be much easier to do. People started to go outside to the point where ""The rain hasn't stopped people from participating,"" said Bogota.

The advantages of car limitations has shown to be much more efficient and benificial towards cities and towns which participated in it. The advantages are that it made the town more productive, cleaner, efficient, and better to walk around in. Car limitations has proven to be an outstanding practice to be used around the world.",0,0.0070740874,0,True
58C2E02C069F,"All across the globe, a revolutionary idea is being set in motion. The idea of essentially banning cars from the streets has sparked as much interest as it has critism. The automotive industy has been booming since World War 2, and although the positive effects of cars can be seen in our daily lives, we seldom take into consideration of the negative impacts of cars. Effects such as pollution, traffic, and cost have impacted our lives as automotive users, even if we have not realized it.

Pollution is one of the primary concerns of a world that is constantly driving, yet it is something people hardly take into account when driving. In theory that is understandable, considering the last thing a person is thinking about when they're driving is what their car is spitting out into the atmosphere. However pollution doesn't go unnoticed for long. For example, the city of Paris, France enforced a partial driving ban in order to decrease the almost record breaking pollution across the city, stating, ""[The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world."" The smog did clear from the city and previous driving laws were reinstated, however this shows how car pollution has a negative impact on the world around us.

Another negative impact of driving is traffic. Traffic is a driver's worst nightmare, and it affects all of us at some point in our lives. In Bogota, Columbia, citezens participated in a driving-free day, where everyone was encouraged to either hike, bike, skate, or use public transportation in order to reach their destination. This event, in which millions of Colombians participated, was reportedly ""leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" This program left a positive mark on the city of Bogota, and will hopefully soon spread to other countries, reducing crowded, traffic filled streets around the world.

The world runs on money, just ask any Wall Street broker. This is a paradox concerning both car owners and people looking to purchase a car. The question remains, if we're all trying to save money, why spend thousands of dollars on a costly car? According to a census taken in 2013, ""Part of the explination certainly lies in the recession, because cash-strapped Americans could not afford cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway."" This shows that the number of people buying cars is steadily decreasing. Another costly problem of cars is fuel. Buying gasoline for your car every week can get incredibly costly, especially when driving a large truck or sports car. This shows how the cost of cars can have a negative impact on our lives.

In conclusion, the use of cars is steadily declining. Cars just aren't a very positive motive for transportation anymore considering the effects of pollution, traffic, and cost that cars produce.    ",0,0.27997017,0,True
E267AD56BEDA,"Dear Principal,

I have recently read the school's cell phone policy. I believe that policy number two is the best choice. Students shouldn't have cell phones in school at all because it can take their minds of their school work. For example, if someone sends a text to a student, it can distract that student and take their mind off their school work.

Students need to stay focused during school at all times. This is very important because students today need to be prepared for high school, college, and their future. Cell phones would distract students from striving for outstanding grades.

Today, you see the majority of students on their cell phones all day, usually texting. This habit can make students lack from doing their work in school. Students grades can easily drop and their only explanation for these poor grades is that they focused on their cell phones more than their education.

Being on cell phones all day can lead a student to a lot of stress. If a student does after school activities and sports, they still need to focus on school. Many students today are very busy with after school activities with their friends. Since the students do activities with their friends, they tend to text each other, and then that is all they are focused on. The students then don't care any more about their school work because they choose to focus on their cell phones.

I hope you understand my reasons why I believe that students shouldn't have phones on school at all. Students should really care about their education and focus in school . Education in the world really matters and is so important for students' future. Cell phones are not going to help a student have a successful future.

I think this would be a good idea because is offering a good opportunity for people that can not be able to attend the school during the morning for other occupation personal and give a chance to get the diploma .Also is good opportunity to the people the can not be able to attend classes because they work. Is good opportunity for the people that can not attend classes and miss school because they do not have transport to go school. But is amazing that can take one class online without attend to school that's a lot of benefit for people that don't work .Is offering a big opportunity to take the class at home and do not drive every day to the class in the school.

Being able to to attend classes by home online is a good opportunity because not all school is offering the chance to take classes by home online. Taking classes online can improve the student and offering the opportunity to graduate without attend the schools and miss classes for not reason. This would be more benefit because some student skip classes when they go to school so they are losing his grades. But with the opportunity doing online student can make the class and not skip school and class for not reason.

Student can learn more with this benefit doing online because they can no get distracted by his friend of the side and can get more focus in the class online. for instance The students would be better doing the class online because when they go to school they get a lot of distracted and not put attention to the teacher when they talk .But online no body is making noise by your side and interruption to you that's helping to you a lot .Is good benefit to can graduated and doing all the think well online at home.

Some student can be more benefit because they have to work and be able to do online is good opportunity to all students can finish the school. For example they can finish extra work after they work a long they and be able the pass the grade doing all the step at home without go the school and miss the class offering the opportunity to do online without going anywhere just by doing online can be more benefit because can not be more stressing like in the school when you have to do a lot of work do not get the correct time to do it ,but when with this opportunity can be the best option to can finish late and extra work. and Also they don't have to find a transport to go to the school every day they only have to join online and make the work.

Finally i think this opportunity is huge benefit for the people the don't have the chance to go the school and for those students that need to graduated because they have to do a lot of think but want to get his diploma this can be the best opportunity for those people that want to be some one in his future some people have to work hard every day and they don't have good opportunity to finish they high school but in this school they offering a huge benefit that give to us a opportunity to take classes online that's going to be for me the best opportunity the i never seen before in schools .",0,0.0069257994,0,True

I believe that students should be able to bring their cell phones to school because of many different reasons. Such as if their parent needs to tell them something and the school line is busy, what would they do then. What if a Child Molester were to steal a kid off the playground they would have their phone to call for help, or text for help.

Now, I know these things are a little far fetched but would you risk a student like that. One of the students relatives could have died or is in the hospital and the student needs to go to a friends house after school because the parents are at the hospital that is in another town. Texting the student would be much easier that calling the school and keeping the kid from class for 10-20 minutes wouldn't it.

Now, this whole Child Molester thing most likely will not happen but i mean just in case right. It would be better if the student had there phone on them just in case something happened. Another case would be students running off to were a teacher could not see them. Jr. High, High School, Elementary it doesn't matter kids are rebellious by nature. These kids that ran off, one of them gets hurts no time to run to a teacher and run all the way back. So, what do you do you pull out your cell phone and call the school or a friend that you know will answer. Then a teacher comes and helps you and you get in trouble for not being where you were supposed to be doing. But everybody is ok, why because you let them bring their phone to school.

These things most likely will not happen but you have to think outside the box because anything can happen in this crazy mixed up world.

Helping others is the main reason that you should do this whole SeaGoing program! It woud be great for you to get out and see the world!

It would be great for you to go out and see the world, and it is pretty amazing. The trip to Europe is pretty educational, and humbling. You can learn about tides, and seafare, as well as swells and knots. These are all things I have learned over my ""nine trips---the most of any SeaGoing Cowboy."" It is also great for getting to know others, and learning about different cultures. Another very interesting topic that is brought up when you sign up for the Seagoing Cowboys is the sightseeing.

Sightseeing is a great part of these trips. You see, when you get to wherever you are delivering you don't have to do the drop off as well. All you have to do is wait for the sailors but until then you get to look at the attractions. For instance, I saw ""the Acropolis in Greece"" which normally you have to buy plane tickets or boat tickets to get to Greece but when you join you get see these attractions virtually free! I also got to ""take a gondalo ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water!""

But the most important part is helping others.

Helping others is the whole reason you should sign-up. You are doing somethining good, not for your self, but for the world, or a specific part of the world anyway. You are also stepping out of your way to help others, you will be rewarded for what you did on Earth in heaven. You will probably, unknowingly save lives while doing this. Helping people is actually good for our brains, it makes us more satisfied with ourselves and we become happier, healthier, and more fun to be around!

You may be thinking we shouldn't go because we like our lives here. Well step outside your comfort zone, stand up for those people who need us, and be the man that says ""I will go and help these people!""

F6D999ED97B8,"Some people think that the Face on Mars was created by aliens, which is anaccurate. Mars obviously has alot of natural disasters on its planet almost daily. These natural disasters could've made the surface into a face like shape by how much damage was caused to the enviroment. Mars is full of red bolders that could of been tossed around by the storms and left marks or craters in the surface. I have a little more detail to my theory.

First, there is no sign of alien life on Mars. I'm not saying there's no sign of life on Mars period, there is sign of water being on that planet and possibaly plants as well. It's just that there is no sign of a species on that planet, not even fossils of the so called ""aliens"". If there was any aliens on Mars what material would they have to make any form in the ground. Aliens probably wont have any exsplosives on their planet with no material to make it with.

Next, if there were any aliens why would they make a face on the ground. It has no meaning to it, it might just be a ruler/king or something to their people. I dont think aliens would want to put a face on the ground that barely looks like a face. The enviroment made the form because the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho was made by our enviroment, so it can be a caquensadence. That's a compairason that leads me to believe the enviroment of Mars made that face on the surface.

Then, there are scientific facts and quotes from NASA that supports lots of evidence. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter revealed that the Face was a natural landform. And added that ""there was no alien monument after all."". The team snapped ten photos of the lanform that was sharper then the first camera of Viking 1. This team gives more evidence than the conspiracy theories by the public.

In conclusion, I think that my theory is both accurate and logical. I took edvice from people who did their research on this topic. The evidence that i took were both believable and not crazy theories from ordinary citizens. These are my reasonings on why i think that the Face was made by Mars enviroment.

For most people that form of transportation is a car.

Cars are used not only as transportation but are also used for recreation and competiton.

Self-driving cars may take away from the recreation and competition parts and make the hobbies of many people become non-existant.

One could argue that roads would be safer with cars capable of driving themselves, but the reality is a computer is no replacement for a human brain.

A computer with all the little circuts and fuzes it has is not able to make a decision that solves problems beyond the one it is currently faced with.

Therefore car accidents will stil loccur and when an accident does occur who is to be held accountable?

Who wil pay the cost o fthe damage? ""Who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?""(paragragh 9)

One cannot simply say that the the dumbest car is the one to blame.

Nor can he or she say that the drivers are at fault if they had no control over their car.

Driving can also be used as an escape.

Some people race their cars as a hobby and others just enjoy a nice Sunday cruise around town.

Either way they are not driving so they will not find the refuge from day-to-day life they seek.

What would be the fun of going to a track and sitting in a car you love and then have it drive itself around the track.

Pushing a car ro its max and diving into corners and accelerating out of them is what makes driving fun.

Without the roar of an engine reving at eight thousand RPM and the squeal of tires barely golding on to asphalt what would racing a car be?

A major issue with autonomous cars would be that of cost.

As the founder of the Google Car Project said ""Radar was a device at the top of a hill that costs two hundred million dollars.

It wasn't something you could buy at Radio Shack.""

The U.S. cannot afford a road system that will put us deeper into the sixteen trillion dollar hole we are in.

The price of cars would also rise making them for only people who could afford them.

A car with a higher price tag means a smaller market will be able to purchase them and less money is to be made.

Less money made means less money spent by the employees and that will make the economy worse.

There will always be risks and certain safety regulations just as with regular cars but having the technology and not using it would be taking a step back.

The use of driverless cars may seem lazier or seem to have more risks than a manual car but is that not what people once thought about regular cars? Cars already start themselves and can be put in a self driving setting, so a full time driverless car would be a step in the right direction and be all around safer for citizens and drivers everywhere. Having technology run your car rather than a human, the risk and chance of a wreck would decrease dramatically. Although as of now a malfunction in the technology that could cause a crash and whether the manufacturer or the driver is to blame is a blurry topic the restriction of testing the cars would never give them the opportunity to fix the problems. Progress is slow as shown in 2013 when BMW announced the ""Traffic Jam Asssistant,"" which can only function up to 25 mph which wouldn't be nearly enough to drive on actual roads yet but the progress is still there.

301EA5259E90,"""On your mark get set GOOO!!!"" Some people would miss the sound of NASCAR or other racing events. I personally feel that not having any cars would make the world a better healthier place to live in.

First off I feel that not having any cars would save people a lot of money. Just think what you actually need to pay when you have a car. Once a month you have to pay for a car payment (if it isn't payed off), insurance, and gas. Now think that you also need to have a lisence and have your car registered. In VAUBAN Germany residents don't have cars due to the fact that it costs $40,000 just to own a parking spot. 70 percent of the families there don't own a car and 57 percent sold their car just to move there. Now that is a way for the world to survive and now your wallet.

Next I will say how having less cars will affect the world's pollution. The people of the world rely on using cars wether it's to go to another state or just for a drive to the corner store. People have burned so many fossil fuels into the air that smog levels can reach record highs everyday. In Paris their was a day where they almost reached a record high and thye had to take half the people off the road and if they used their car anyway they would get fined. This caused the smog level to go down to a safe level after just five days. Smog can't go away over night do to warm daytime hours and cold night time hours and it would get trapped in an air pocket. But i guess this was just a close call.

My final reason to write would be due to the level stress driving has on people. Just think everyday you have a chance on dieing in a car due to an accedent. You just drive a metal cage at high speeds and have a chance of running into each other. When you are riding a bike you don't ever have to worry about runing into oter people all you think about is that you're having a nice time. Even when you're walking you don't have to stress about people running into you because its just walking. Besides walking is just human nature so why would we stress over it?

In summary I feel that not using cars is helpful due to not having to pay as much, their is less polution in the air and you tend to just be lessed stressed in general. Wouldn't you want to leave this a clean and stress free place?    ",0,0.0072715837,0,True

Self-driving cars is a great idea and process, although it may have many faults, it may reduce the risk of car accidents. Driverless cars are a great advance in technology and with the perfect twists and tweaks, these cars could impact our futures majorly. Driverless cars may reduce the risk of accidents, help the driver multitask in a way, and seem very efficent in achieving the goal of changing our future. Self driving cars is a unique idea and it very well may be our future.

Self driving cars could help us reduce the number of accidents. The idea of the car assisting us is a great factor into why these cars could be useful. In paragraph 10 it says, ""Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time."" That leaves a little room for the driver to make decisions. That means the driver is still in control. ""The only safe car has a human driver control at all times"" (paragraph 9). The car is not driving itself, it is assisting you in the fact that you are in control of what the car does or doesn't do. With the tweaking of these cars, I feel as if this would be a conveniant idea, and help reduce the causes of car accidents.

Texting and driving is one of the greatest factors to the cause of motor vehicle crashes. The ability the smart car has to help the driver multitask could help if not stop the crashes caused by someone texting or paying attention to something else. ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves"" (paragraph 7) With the ability to do practically any driving skill with little help by the driver, this could very well give the ability of multitasking to drivers. Knowing that being able to eat or text while driving and having no troubles may help the effect texting and driving has on cars and drivers.

The self driving car seems like a consistent idea. With technology on the rise we very well could have the perfect car to fix all our problems. All of the car manufacturers are trying their hardest to do what's best for drivers. ""they needed a whole lot of sensors"" (paragraph 4). With the improvements on things like the sensors, this car could be one of the greatest accomplishments ever. ""Further improvements in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own"" (paragraph 4). This goes to show that they are taking advantage of the new opportunities they receive each and every day. This use of technology to help the car could help lead to one of the greatest improvements in our era.

With driverless cars, our whole lives could be changed. The reduction of accidents and deaths will drop with these advances. A car that can do the impossible can very well be our future.

There are so many thing that can go wrong, a crash, then increase in insurance, you might even get your license taken away after that.

Once your on the road, anything can happen. It's dangerous, i sometimes even wonder if i really want a license.

When you drive there are so many traffic jams. The idea of never having to worry about traffic again is intriguing. Why worry about having to rush through traffic just to get to work on time, when instead you can simply manage your time correctly and walk at the pace you are comfortable with. Traffic jams cause accidents that put peoples lives at risk.

The carfree day in Colombia is working to perfection to promote alternative transportation, i don't see why we dont have this in the United States.

driving causes stress and tension and that's never good. A stressed driver is a dangerous driver, when you're stressed you become more careless and less aware of your surroundings and that is very dangerous as a driver it leads to reckless driving and accidents. Being without a car relieves this stress for many people. In the article, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, a quote from the article states, ""When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter. This shows that cars are a lot to handle and that most people just believe it is too much stress for one person to deal with.

The smog and pollution caused by all the cars that are on the road these days is another reason why it is best to stay off the road. In the article, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, he says, ""The smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world"". The cities ban on cars on the road shows a serious concern in the saftey of the people because of all the smog that driving has caused.

If you give them to much it might take away from their learning experience and also they might not do a good job. If i was given to much i would probably slack off too. But i think it would be better if they would volunteer. Maybe if you give them an assignment to help the community for a week and then at the end ask them if they like it or not. If they don't like their assignment you could give them a new one until they get one they like doing.

I don't think you should give them any over the top assignments either. If the students are strained to much they could hurt themselves or it could cause a lot of stress. School is already a lot of stress with homework, schoolwork, after school events, and clubs. So if there is too much stress on them coming from the community service their grades could slip, they could rebel against the teachers or even their parents.

Also to save gas and money i think you should keep these tasks simple and very local. The supplies for these activities are probably going to be very expensive to begin with and children can be careless and break something.

I have noticed that the area around the school is very messy and needs to be cleaned. This could be a low cost job. Also there could be a garden or some trees planted to make the school look better and full of life. Also there are a few people living around the school that don't seem to have a lot of money so we could help clean their yards or plant a garden for them.

Something that could not only help your students but also make you school better is have some of the older students tutor the younger kids so you could save money on hiring people to come to tutor them.

So as you can see there are many reasons to make and not to make students do community service. But if you can compromise with the students about this i think it could benefit the school, the students, and the community. Thank you for listening to my suggestions and i hope you make a wise decision.

Sincerely,

This author provided very good research but the research and evidence throughout the entire article controdicted their main message. To make this article better, more evidence on why studying venus is benefical should be provided to support their claim.

In this article the evidence they use for example: ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals"" and also ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus"" supports the controdicting claim that going to Venus is too dangerous with too many complications. Throughout the whole passage the author states many reasons on why it's too dangerous to go to Venus and all the complications that would happen if going there. They also show all the major problems with NASA's idea of a solution, but never came up with their own possible idea of a solution. This leads you to believe that the author is against going to Venus. I dont disagree that going to Venus will gain us insight on the planet, spark imagination, and create innovation but the author's claim needs to be more supported and obvious throught the passage.

Some good things about this passage is that they do provide great evidence and research. They provide input from NASA and NASA's insight on the whole thing and a possible solution. They also provide facts about the atmosphere and about the conditions of the planet. Them providing all this evidence helps the reader themselves have almost enough information to come up with their own opinion on the topic. Although I still stand by this article needing much more information on why and how we could go to Venus safe and affectively.

Overall this article's information and research was great and really did inform me about the planet, but the conclusion ruiened it all. The whole time (paragraphs 1-7) the author lead all the readers to believe that going to Venus has too many dangers and isnt in our best interest, yet the conclusion stated that going to Venus would be a great oppurtunity and that ""Our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"". If the passage had evidence all throught that going to Venus is beneficial, it would be a perfect article but i was all around confused when I found out the author was all for going to Venus and it ruiened and confused the whole article.

Acceddents happen and accidents will still happen its not the car its the perso whom is driving. Sould you be hadycapped or sck,or having issues with your sight. The Driverless Cars are a more safe and enviromental transportation system. Think about it it would be more safe for everyone.

522BE2470C36,"Growing up, my mother always made me and my sister complete education booklets during the summer to make sure we didn't loose all of the knowledge we gained from the prior school year. Like my mother, some schools require students to do summer projects to ensure that students continue to learn and remember what they have learned in the past. These projects are either student-designed or teacher-designed, depending on the school. Some believe that having student-designed projects is better because it gives them more freedom with their project; however, having a teacher-designed project is more beneficial. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because the teacher will be able to establish a standard for the project, their will be a smaller risk of students picking information that is not beneficial or relevant to what they have learned, and it will be more challenging for the students.

The assigned summer projects should be teacher-designed because the projects will set a standard for the teacher and the student. If the students could choose what they wanted to for the project, their would be an array of design and information. This can make it hard for teachers to grade projects or even see where students are at educationally. Having a teacher-designed projects allows the teacher to have a standard platform to grade from and see how the students are doing. Also, having a teacher-designed project makes it fair for all of the students. One student make work very hard all summer to obtain a great project and another might spend the night before the first day of school completing it. Having a teacher-designed project ensures that all of the students are putting in the same amount of time and effort to get a good grade. A teacher-designed project is better than a student-designed project because it allows the teachers to grade fairly and see how the students are doing so far and it also makes sure students are equally investing in the project.

Moreover, summer projects should be teacher-designed because it ensures that the information within the project is beneficial and educational to what the students has been learning. If the students have freedom to pick the project, they could pick things such as cars, food, games, and so forth. This may not seem too bad, but it is defeating the purpose of having a summer project, which is to keep the students learning. If the teachers pick the information in the porject, they can orient it so that the students will be either getting a refresher from what they learned the previous year or get a glimpse at what they will learn in the following year. Having a teacher-designed project prevents students from picking silly topics and makes sure that the information benefits the students in their learning transition between school years.

Lastly, having a teacher-designed summer project is better than a student-designed summer project because it will challenge the students more. With a student-designed project, the students can make it as difficult or as easy as they wish. Some students could make their projects too easy, not allowing for any education growth; other students could make their project too hard, taking away time from their summer break. With a teacher-designed project, the teacher can ensure that the project is equal parts easy and difficult, so that the students are not wasting their whole summer but are still challenged and pushed. If the project is easy for the students, they will not learn the material to their full capacity. If the project challenges them, they will learn more and feel more accomplished when they finish it.

A student-designed project may sound nice to students and parents because it is more flexible and more enjoyable for the students, but it is not more beneficial for the student's learning. Having a teacher-designed project ensures fairness by setting a standard for grading and evaluating and by students having to out in the same amount of time and effort. A teacher-designed project also allows the teacher to pick a topic or subject that is beneficial to what they have learned or will learn soon. Lastly, the teachers designing the projects allows the students to be challenged and grow in their education. A teacher designed project is all around more beneficial for students and teachers. ",0,0.006512598,0,True

We are all americans here so we should have the freedom we were ment to have. I understand that we do in fact have a lot more freedom than other countries but I am talking more on voting freedom. The electoral collegee is, in my opinion and many others, a bad way to decide the president of the United States of America. I believe that for americans we should have a better say in things and agree that we rather have popular voting than what we have now. Others believe the electoral collegee helps with Big States issues. But in the end popular vote is a good way to help people who deserver presidency to get it.

The article The Indefensible Electoral College, many have agreed on abolishing the electoral college. The article The Indefensible Electoral College... states ""...according to a gallop poll in 2000... over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to what we are doing now."" If we the people do not get final say into things than we are'nt really as free as we are told we are. If the people want a different voting system it should be granted to us. A good example to people who had been effected by this was Al Gore. The article states. ""Al Gore who had won by popular vote but still lost the presidency to the electoral collegee."" This goes to show that he was someone that many wanted as a president but where cheated out by the electoral collegee.

Others may believe that the electoral collegee helps not let bigger and more populated states get more attention than a smaller state would. But even by popular vote this would be the same. If a populated state votes then they will get basically the same say as they would with the electoral collegee but it would give them more say. Whilst other low population states get less votes and attention just like with the electoral collegee. So even though it would make a great change with other things, this matter is no problem.

Few have lost presidency due to the quirks in the electoral collegee. A good example is Al Gore who I talked about earlier. But still in the future changing to popular vote will help people who earned presidency actually get it. Instead of being scammed out of their votes by the electoral collegee. If someone has earned the presidencty then they should have the right to it, but with the electoral collegee in the way some are unable to actually do this. If we the people want someone to be the president than we want them! Al Gore won popular vote but since we do not get the only say he had lost presidency. If popular demand was the only voting system than we would probably be in a better place right now.

In conclusion, we the people of the united states deserve to actually have our own and only say in to who is going to lead us. If we say we want them, we want them... I understand that we our the ones that get the say, but we are being evened out by state percentage, so basically popular voting is ruled out. Popular voting is a better way to vote mainly because it is straight forward and to the point. If someone receives more individual votes than they should be the president... It is a easy straight forward process...",0,0.0068517555,0,True

It will be a scary day when driverless cars become the new normal. Imagine roads filled with cars, but the drivers are like unalert zombies. Sure having cars that drive themselves sounds splendid, but would the benefits really outweigh the cons?

For many people learning to drive and getting their license is a huge milestone. It is like one step closer to becoming an independant adult. I can't imagine teens growing up and never learning to drive. That would be like not learning to swim!

Driving is a skill that people need to aquire even if driverless cars become popular, because machines fail. You can't always depend on machines to be accurate all of the time. You might be thinking that machines don't make mistakes as often as humans, but humans are the ones that make the machines. What happens if you are riding in a driverless car and it just stops working? Will you just sit there and wait to die?

In the passage it says that most driverless cars aren't actually driverless, they need assistance from humans. The fact that the car does most tasks like steering, accelerating, and braking makes it easy for humans to get distracted. Most people get distracted by their cellphones alone! If they thought they could totally rely on the car to do what they needed, they would probably be totally unaware of their surroundings.

There is a reason that only a few states allow the use of semi-autonomous cars. The laws are written for cars that are controlled by humans. The laws in place currently would not be suffecient for self driving cars. Sure the laws could be changed, but who gets to decide what the guidless to self driving cars should be?

Human brains are easily adaptable, but machines need to be programmed. What happens when a car faces a situation that it isn't ready for? Also, what happens if someone hacks into the car's system and makes it malfunction? There could be a computer virus that would cause all the cars in the world to crash.

Although I do think there are lots of cons to driverless cars, I do acknowledge the benefits. Early versions of semi-driverless cars have been somewhat successful by driving half a million miles without a crash. However, that doesn't mean that totally autonomous cars will be successful.

I think certain feautres on cars like cruise control are a huge benefit, but I don't know if I'm willing to trust machines to take the steering wheel yet. Who knows, maybe fifteen years from now I will own my own driverless car, but there are some huge advances that need to be made first.    ",0,0.0066608437,0,True
758A03587A0E,"Summer is a students time to relax and take a long break from the chaos that endures during the school year. This break is normally for beach trips and days at the pool with ones friends. Although, some schools make students complete projects over the summer to make sure they stay sharp and are prepared for the more difficult school year that lies ahead of them. These projects will either be designed by students or by a faculty member of the school district. These summer projects, most likely an already unwanted assignment, should be designed by the students for reasons that will make a difference in the long run of the students education like, students know students best, keeping work balanced, and getting rid of unnecessary work.

The first reason students should be the creators of these projects is because students know students best. When a teacher designs a projects sometimes they do not always know how kids will respond to the assignment and how that will effect what they are learning. For example if a student is excited for a project they are going to be more willing to finish it and will be more excited to learn about the material it is on, and students know what they like best and are able to create these assignments that will work in their benefit and will make them enthusiastic about what they are doing. Which in turn will make the project more effective towards their education and will end up helping the teachers. All in all, students know what they like best.

Another issue is with facility giving out these projects is they can sometimes overdue what they are giving out. This meaning students will be able to give out a balanced schedule for the other students to complete. For example they will have a set amount of work for two weeks and they will have deadlines within the break. This is not saying teachers cannot do this but students will be able to provide a fair amount of work for the others to do without the students feeling like they have too much to do over a short period of time. This will also in turn make the projects easier to digest for students and not overwhelm them when the time comes for them to start it.

The final reason it would be better for students to create this projects is because a lot of the time students feel that teachers give out work that is not necessary. I have seen this happen all of the time, teachers give out work that does not feel like it is helping with out education but there just to keep us busy or ""busy work"". The elimination of this work would be very beneficial to not only our time but our feelings toward the project and our eagerness to finish it. If we feel like we are doing work that does not benefit us in any way it does not make us enthusiastic about what we are doing and will only make us go into the school year feeling hostile that the teachers made us do that work. If students were creating the projects they would be able to almost eliminate this work entirely and keep it to only what we need to do. If a student feels they need more practice on a certain topic they would be able to provide that practice option without having everyone else do it if they do not need the practice.

In conclusion, if students were able to create these projects they would be able to reach the other students in a way that a facility member would not. Once again, students know students best. With students making these projects we would be able to change the feeling toward doing school work in the summer from a negative to possibly even a positive if done correctly. These summer projects, most likely an already unwanted assignment, should be designed by the students for reasons that will make a difference in the long run of the students education like, students know students best, keeping work balanced, and getting rid of unnecessary work.

I am writing this letter to inform you on my opinion on whether or not you should require students to perform some act of community service.

In my point of view I think you should only let the kids that want to do community service do it. If you require your students to perform community service and they do not want to they will not do a good job. The kids that want to do community service do it because they like it and they can put it on their future resume.

Other kids think that when you are doing community service you are giving back to the community. The are but there are other ways to do so as well. They could join a form of sports team for the town and try their best to win for their community. They could do their best in school to represent the community in a good way. They may also have a job, pay their taxes and their bills.

By reducing the usage of cars, you allow for your community to flourish in other ways than building or repairing roads. Since there would be less people driving cars, the community can focus on other things. For example, in Bogota, Columbia, because of the Day Without Cars, there have been 118 miles of bicycle paths that have been constructed. Also, ""parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city."" Old sidewalks are being replaced with new ones, and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have also opened up. All of these great things are happening to the community of Bogota, Columbia, just because they have limited their usage of cars (source 3).

Also, limiting the use of cars would reduce pollution. In places like Paris, France, diesel has been blamed for Paris' days of nar-record pollution. Paris has more smog than most other European capitals, because they have more people driving cars (source 2). ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe ... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the US"" (source 1).

Finally, decreasing the usage of cars would create better lifestyles for people. People would be healthier and happier, because instead of driving around everywhere, they get some fresh air and more exercise. Heidrun Walter said that ""when [he] had a car [he] was always tense. [He is] much happier [not driving his car]"" (source 1). Also, don't you hate it when you're stuck in the rush-hour?

With us humans we have many different statues monuments tall skyscrapers not just one of them. For example the pyramids they we obviously were not naturally made but there are many of them that are exactly the same. So if that was made by aliens I feel like there would be many more that resembled the landform or some other odd landforms.

769F4CA4E31F,"Dear Florida senator, this letter is to discuss my opinion about the voting system for how the new president of the United States of America should be elected or for how the current president should serve another term. The main topic for this letter, is wether or not we should keep the Electoral College or disregard it and go to popluar vote. Giving this topic into consideration, it should be best if we switch to popular vote. Candidates not focusing their attention on all the states and that the outcome could be a tie are the different apects on why we should abolish Electoral College and bring forth popular vote.

To begin with, candidates don't focus on trying to get all the states to vote on them in Electoral College. The explanation for this is because since its the ""winner-take-all"" system, the competors disregard the states where they know they're not going to win over the majority. They don't even show up to the states or try to win them over. ""During the 2000 campain, seventeen states didn't see the candidiates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campain ad"" quoted from ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer. Some might say that this is not a huge issue, but it is to the states that are being ignored. They want equality and a chance to be recognized by each of the rivals. It is clear to see that the candidates give no sign of importance to states that have slim chances of them voting for him/her.

Continuing on further, the Electoral College's outcome could end up in a tie. In a result of this mishap, the state delegates, from the House of Representatives, start to vote for the president. The vice-president is chosen by the The Senate. Each state has one vote to choose which side their rooting for. The silver lining in this decision is that, different states have different amount of population, so it's unfair for all the states to have the same amount of power in choosing the president. ""Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters"" taken from ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best best-laid defenses are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer. People doubt that there will ever be a tie but they're were close ones in 1968 and 1976. There's no doubt that, if a tie happens in the Electoral College, everything would go down south.

To sum it all up, reasons why we should switch out of Electoral College is because candidates don't focus on every state and that the final outcome might end up to be a tie. The Electoral College should be abolished due to these reasons. Popular vote is the best for our country. It'll help the voting system by an abundant amount.

Nevertheless is it not a good idea for students, because they tired more early, bring more focus on some classes but not in the others, and they not take a break on summer.

They can be tired more early because some time they worry for the work that they have . For example, students pass more time study and not take a break. Most students going to school sleep because in the night they study for exams, or make some proyect that they left. most of them have many homework and they not finish on time because they are tired and need to sleep to going with energy on the school though they are not finish the homework. In concept the students need more time to make the school work because if they take the offer to graduate in three years they need to give everything on time.

Most of them bring more focus on some classes that others because they think that some classes are more important and the others not. Nevertheless the grades can be going down for the reasons that the students not put attention on classes, or not make the work. Also they need to make the work of the all classes because that importan, and all classes they need for graduate. This can be give them problems if they not make anything for they grades going up because if they have bad grades they can not graduate in three years. Clearly the students forget the importan that all classes are for graduate.

The students not take a break on summer because they want to going the summer school for make more classes.

DFADF4684C43,"The Dangers of Driving with a Phone

On a daily basis the majority of humans own and utilize cell phones. The use of a cell phone while driving can lead to injuring yourself; injuring others on the road; and having a record in the system. Drivers shouldn't be able to use cell phones while driving a vehicle.

Drivers are risking their lives when they decide to utilize their cell phones while driving. The cell phone is a form of distraction that can cause an accident. An article points out ""Failing to keep a proper lookout and to pay attention to surrounding dangers because of distractions caused by the cell phone"" (Warner and Sherman para. 4). Giving your phone a quick glance can result in an accident. Therefore, it's important to always keep your eyes on the road while driving.

People are not only risking themselves but others on the road as well; when they decide to use their cell phones. Talking or texting while driving is life threatening; that being the case it's essential not to try to multitask while driving a vehicle. When a driver is not being continuously attentive while driving; it can cause an accident. If they crash into another car; they're putting others life in danger. People need to be considerate of the other drivers on the road; so they need to be focused on their surroundings when driving.

Although, no state bans all cell phone use for all drivers. If you were to get in an accident because you were using a cell phone there would be consequences to the one at fault. If an accident were to occur you're more likely to face jail time; especially if it resulted in the other driver getting injured. Being in this situation can result in having a record in the system. A way to avoid this from occurring you would have to consider to put your cell phone on 'Do not disturb'.

At the end of the day it's a choice to decide whether or not you're going to utilize a cell phone while driving. Humans need to be cautious because their actions can affect others immensely. No one would want to live knowing they caused great pain to one's family; especially if they were to be the ones' who caused the accident because of driving with a cell phone. Drivers should avoid using a cell phone while driving a vehicle because of the dangers.      ",0,0.0070706857,0,True
A00A8837B25B,"Anybody is capable of doing anything no matter how bad obstacles can get. Failure is one of the biggest reasons why most of people are successful. Although people believe setting our aim low, and achieving our mark is less dangerous than aiming high and failing, nevertheless, aiming low, and achieving our mark is a greater danger because there's no limits to what people can do and failure gives motivation to work harder to achieve more and be successful in life.

To begin, setting our aim low, and achieving our mark is a greater danger than setting our aim high and falling short because there's no limits to what a human being can do and achieve. For example, Isaiah Thomas, he was one of the best basketball players in the NBA at Boston. He's very short, and everyone doubted him and said he's too short and can't make it. That didn't stop him from aiming high and achieving his goal and becoming of one the shortest people to make it to the NBA. This shows that no matter who the person is, they can accomplish a lot in life as long as they work hard. Clearly, everyone should always aim high and accomplish their goal to have a better life later on.

Furthermore, people should always aim high even if they fall short because failure gives motivation to achieve more and come back stronger. For instance, The Golden State Warriors lost the NBA finals in 2016. It was one of the worst finals ever for them. They lost very badly, but that didn't stop them from coming back the next year and winning the championship. This proves that it doesn't matter how bad failure can be, as long as they come back from it stronger. Obviously, no should be scared of failure and everyone should aim high and try to be the best at whatever they do.

Overall, the greater danger for most of people lies in not trying their hardest to be someone in life and aiming low to accomplish their goal because failure motivates the person to comeback stronger and have no limits. In conclusion, Aiming high will get anyone successful as long as they keep working hard and fear nothing.",0,0.15442055,0,True

The teenagers may get bored of just sitting there and not drive, but the older people wont because they could relax. It could be useful either way, maybe some teens would like it because they enjured something, they wouldn't be able to drive now but they could if we had driverless cars. In the passage ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" they said something about putting something in the car to entertain them and making sure they keep their heads up at all times. Just because there is driverless cars coming soon doesn't mean that people can just drive them around whenever they feel like it, its same as being a car when you have control. You still have to watch out and go the speed limit, you can't take it and sleep when it's driving.

Over the past years cars have developed a lot. Now there are cars that you can turn on while you're still in the house, some cars have wifi, you can turn the heat on, and open doors before you get to the car. People want what is new so they can show something off but they don't show off the problems they could have with the car. Now they are making this new thing where a car can drive you around itself without you having to take control? Have they thought about the car accidents that could happen? Or how it could injure someone? This will take more responsibility than what a driver has now.

Would there have to be any test taking for those who want their permit or license? How do you know if they are capable of being in control over those things? Having the cars we have now are good enough. Those who want a driverless cars should still capable of doing the things they do now with a regular car. Senors will still be in the cars, if adding them to the new cars that would make it better for the person and the car.

They want to know who would be responsible for an accident? Well it would be the persons fault. If they aren't looking at the road because they were distracted by something else than that could be bad. They should be able to take control when they see something bad is about to happen.

Now if the driverless cars come with speaking instructions that could make things better because you can tell it what to do. If there is traffic and your vechile is going to fast you should be able to tell it to slow down.

Whether they're or no driverless cars people should always be safe while driving. They should always have their eyes on the road and be able to look to their right and left to make sure it is clear to move over. With this coming out people probably think it will be safer or dangerous. They should put things to entertain them so they can be focused on the road instead of their phones.

0CAB1510D416,"Dear Principal,

There are rumors going around that you might make it mandatory for the students at the school to perform community service hours. I believe that it may be helpful for some students to perform community service because it could keep them out of trouble or serve as their punishment for misbehaving regularly but it could also hinder some students. Some students at the school are well behaved but aren't doing well with their grades. So instead of performing acts for the community they could be studying to improve their grades. With the improvement of grades in the school the students will most likely have less stress on getting their homework finished or working in class and will be more attentive in class.

Another reason not to have community service is that some students have activities outside of school. Sports is a very important activity to some athletic students in the school because that is how some of them are paying for college. If you take that away from them then they might not get a scholarship to the college that they want.

If we do have community service then it should be for students that are doing excellent in schoolwork but not make it mandatory. To make students that are doing well enough in school want to work for the community, there should be a reward for the most hours performed. This way if the students not doing well in all of there classes want to earn the reward they will work harder to do well and get in the race for the prize. The entire school's grade point average will raise if they are willing to work for the prize.

The prize should be something grand and well thought out. It could be a certificate to a restaurant or a few concert tickets. If the entire school does well enough, we should be able to go on a ""fun field trip.""

With these ideas there will possibly be many community service hours performed and grades improved. Please take this letter into thought when you decide on making community service mandatory or not.

Sincerely,

A concerned student.",0,0.0065279333,0,True
318F40822873,"Along with the growing influence of technology in society comes the availability to use it to transform the way in which students are educated. With the use of technology, students could be given the responsibility and freedom to complete classes online rather than having to come into school five times a week. However, not all students have the focus and determination like others to be able to hold themselves accountable for completing their classes at home without a physical instructor. Despite this, I think students would benefit from being able to take online classes at home, rather than at school, as it would give students the opportunity to learn at their own appropriate pace and it would provide a more comfortable learning environment with less distractions.

While in the classroom, it is difficult for teachers to go at a pace that isn't too slow or too fast for every single student since not every student learns at the same pace. I consider myself a relatively slow learner and writer. Therefore, there have been several instances where my teachers would be lecturing and giving notes, and I found myself missing key information because the teacher was not allowing time for us to write it down. However, unlike my other teachers, my history teacher will make us take notes at home. In this instance, taking notes and learning from home, helped me retain and learn the information better than if I were at school because I was not constantly stressing about the teacher switching the slides, and therefore, potentially missing key concepts. Giving students the opportunity to learn from home allows students to make sure they get all of the necessary information that they may need for later success on a test. It also gives students time to be able to make sure that they understand the information on the notes, rather than just typing or writing it down without understanding the meaning behind it. In addition, some of my teachers make assignments due at the end of class, despite some students, like myself, not being able to finish within the time constraint. Although I understand that it is important to be able to complete assignments quickly for the future, I think that in a learning environment that should not be the case. Learning is not about being able to complete an assignment in an hour, but it is about being able to understand new information. Therefore, I think learning from home provides the best learning environment for every student to do well in their education, since they don't have to constantly be overshadowed with the stress of time on important assignments. At home, students are able to ensure that they turn in quality work that will help improve their grades rather than hurt it because of a time constraint. Students should be given the opportunity to take classes from home because not every student learns identically and as quickly as others.

In the event that students would be able to take classes from home, they would also be able to learn in an environment that ensures their greatest focus and success. However, this can be difficult when there are constant distractions in the classroom. For example, in my Pre-Calculus class, there is a specific group of students who are constantly found talking over the teacher as she is trying to teach. Not only does this distract the teacher, but it also distracts me and the other students who are trying to learn the material. To avoid instances like this, students should be able to learn at home where they can sit in a room all by themselves, free from any outside noises or distractions that may hinder their learning. Other students, and sometimes teachers, are simply just added distractions that make it even more difficult for students to focus on learning the information that the teacher is trying to teach to the class. Similarly, while in my AP Chemistry class, since I am usually one of the last students to finish the test, there is always a constant moving of students and whispering among the inconsiderate students who cause me to lose focus. It is very challenging for students to concentrate on their thoughts when they are followed by constant whispering and movement going on in the classroom. These distraction may cause students to either get the question wrong or run out of time, therefore, hurting their education. Furthermore, I constantly find myself being more focused doing my homework rather than trying to do my work in school because I am given an appropriate and quiet learning space that helps me concentrate on what I am doing. Allowing students to learn from the comfort of their home helps minimize the many potential distractions from other students and teachers that only cause problems with the student's concentration.

While trusting students to learn independently may not be appropriate for every student, it can be an important quality for other students to learn the importance of being responsible for their future. Many high school and college classes have leaned greatly towards using technology for student's to complete and turn in assignments. Nowadays, teachers and professors are mostly used for lecturing which can easily be transmitted online. Therefore, as the years progress, and technology grows to be more influential on society, schools should consider taking advantage of technology to ensure a better educational system for every type of student.  ",0,0.9825157,1,False
C1D049335CC0,"The final bell rings as students come flying out the school doors pushing and shoving each other to be the first one on their bus, school is out and the halls are left empty, just when people start to relax at home they remember about the summer project that has to be finished by the time school is back in session. school projects can be a pain, but they do serve a purpose. Teachers require students to complete this summer project to assure they dont loose the knowledge they learned throughout the year and to also assure they continue to learn throughout their break. Summer projects should be student-designed because it gives the student freedom, shows the knowledge of the student, and lets the project vary from student to student.

Summer projects can give students the freedom to do whatever they see fit and show how they can be creative. Students like to have freedom and will put more effort into something where they can choose what to do rather than have the same project assigned to everyone where creativeness is not a product. Students have to complete the work assigned to them in school which is already lacking creativity, teachers should give the students freedom in this summer project and have the student leave the school with a positive outlook. Every day student complain about the lack of freedom school already has, leaving them to be tempted by the things they cannot have.

Schools want to know that the students are keeping their minds fresh with knowledge and over the summer they give them a project to be completed by the time they come back. Having these projects be student-designed can not only be creative but also show what the student knows and remembers. Students can present what they know and how much they continued to learn by the projects they choose to do. The summer projects can also tell a teacher what topic they need to work more on with the students, and is very helpful in doing so.

Students can choose what they want to show and how they want to show it, whether if it is an essay, interview, or a project that have to build, with the ideas being limitless one students project cannot be the same as another, with each project having a unique difference. students can fallow their own rules and go the places their mind takes them. With the projects being different and varying,coming in all shapes and forms, the student can choose what they want to do and what they are be able to do. With the projects being different it can be easier to tell if a student copied another students work, where as if all the projects were kept the same it can not be easy to tell if someone copied another work.

Some teacher may argue and say that a teacher-designed project may be better, but a student-designed project can outbalance the good in a teacher-designed project. Rather that telling us what we need to Know students should be able to show just how much they actually know, some student can look up the information then forget about it because it is something that they are being graded for and have to include it in the project to get the best grade they can achieve. This also helps prepare the student for next year by showing them what they need to work more on and better themselves so the can enter the next year without any problems.

In conclusion schools and teachers should let students design their own summer projects because it gives more freedom to the student, gives teachers a sense of the students knowledge, and gives the project variation. The final bell rings as all the students are let out, but one thing remains hanging over their shoulders, a summer project.    ",0,0.0069656717,0,True

___

It was a exceptionally exciting day for 17-year-old

Brenda because she had not seen her best friend Madison for the past two weeks. Brenda got into her car, put on her seatbelt, and texted Madison to let her know she was picking her up. While driving,

Brenda opened a text five minutes later from Madison.

Taking her eyes off the curvy road for a mere five seconds, she was struck head on by a speeding sports car.

Brenda was gone just like that. Texting while driving "". . . is the act of composing, sending, reading text messages, email or making simular use of the web on a mobile phone while operating a motor vehicle""1. In fact, according to the Department of Motor Vehicles, 63% of drivers report using their cell phone while driving. Numerous reasons exist for the case against cell phone usage while driving such as texting, making phone calls, and checking social media apps.

First , One out of four car accidents in the United States are caused by texting and driving. Texting is a distraction while driving your eyes need to be on the road to avoid accidents.

Therefore When your texting your eyes are on your phone distracted by anything else around you. So many people think they are a professionals at texting And driving but it shouldn't be a skill there's to much at risk. Number one being deaths there are at least deaths a day due to texting and driving.

Second , Driving and talking on the phone can be just as dangerous as texting and driving. A new study shows accident are more likely when you're using a hands free phone device then when you're talking to a passenger you're also very likely to speed. Also a big misconception is that as long as you hands are free you should be safe no problem right?... Wrong. Having a voice engage people in conversation that make some people react badly or late to hazards so that is a distraction similar to texting and driving.

Lastly , According to a study Checking social media is just as dangerous as drunk driving. Unfortunately Teens have been so affected by society they always have their phones out snapchatting or posting something about the morning traffic. Personally this is the worst one the list. Checking is examining something in order to determine its accuracy , quality , or condition meaning you would be doing this for a good amount of time. Enough time to be in an accident. For example taking your eyes off the road for 5 seconds going 50 miles an hour is like driving blindfolded for a length of a football field which is extremely dangerous.

In conclusion here in the state of georgia there is a no hands law were holding or supporting , with any part of the body , wireless telecommunications device or stand alone electronic device (for example , an ipod). This law is going to prevent many accidents of course people will still do it i known people who do but the statics will go down.

I agree with this view, but I also disagree.

Many students would try to get a higher grade to be able to do activities, but some would just blow it off like everything else.

I would probably try harder to earn a chance to do special activities.

Many other students will most likely try harder for a few weeks but then just forget about it.

My agreeing point is that it would be a very suitable way to achieve a higher average.

A great number of students will achieve this goal if they truly love the activity like football, tennis, etc.

It may succeed and truly lift the spirits of students to achieve greater obstacles, and of course their favorite activity.

My disagreeing point however, is that many of the student body will think it's a dumb idea and most likely just ignore the proposal.

Lots of your students, as I'm sure you already know, don't believe they can do more than they do.

And many just think it's cool to look stupid, walking around with an F average.

Many people I know have more brains than they give themselves credit for.

If I walk up to one of my friends and ask them a quizzical question, most the time they know it but try to cover it up with some stupid remark.

All I'm saying is that it would be worth the try, but possibly a waste of your time.

It may be forgotten as soon as it's proposed.

It could also succeed and make school all the more worth while.

It could improve the school's average and just make it a happy year.

But it could also just doom the school's students to furthermore think of themselves as ""I'm too dumb to do it, so I just won't.""

4CF4A9C28ECE,"Extracurricular activities can open up students to thousands of different opportunities; the amount of extracurricular activities are almost endless. A few of these activities could be: playing on a sports team, joining a club, or even being part of the student council. All three of these activities could be very beneficial, and impact your life tremendously. Students would be able to experience things they may not of ever known they had a interest in, or perhaps in the process of the activity they may form a fondness for that certain thing. The activities the student may participate in can also give the student a more neutral place to relax and just be a kid. This would help the student finish their homework, and forget about all the stress of their day. The idea of a student must participate in an extracurricular activities is an extraordinary idea because it would help students form a healthier lifestyle, meet new people, and there is a chance a student may perhaps gain a new interest.

Most importantly, extracurricular activities would allow a student to make better life choices and become a better person in general. The main activity that could cause a change a students life is playing a sport. Playing sports grants the student a chance to be a part a team that will support them and help them make good choices, that will impact there life positively. Sports also help the student become more active, so this means the student will be healthier, and they may even preform better in school. Being more active can also lead to your personality and your mental health to increase. This can lead to a student being nicer to their peers, or other students at the school, getting better grades, having a better outlook on negative situations, and just all around living life to its fullest.

In addition to sports there are clubs. Clubs can also impact students, but they can also have an impact on the school. Clubs give the chance for students to meet new people that they might of never meet before in their regular school day. Students may meet a remarkable number of new friends when they join a club. There are a lot of good reasons that meeting new people is good, but her are only a few. The friends that they meet can have the same interests as them, which can lead to even more things they may want to do with their newly acquired friends. The new people a student may meet can also be good role model for the student ,and they can give the student good advice on how to handle problematic situations. It is always good to have a person that will try to help you succeed in life, rather than a person who tries to take you down the wrong path in life. Finally, a student will become more socially active, and hang out and do things with the new friends that they have gained. No one ever likes to be lonely, so clubs can give you a place to socialize and do great things with others.

Furthermore, an extracurricular activity can also help a student find a new interest in what they are doing. A student may do something they are not comfortable with at first, but then there might be a hint of fun or comfortability in the new activity. It is always good to try new things because a student may never know if they will like it or not. An extracurricular activity that could open you up to something different could be, being a part of the student council. The student council would allow a student to do things outside of their comfort zone and experience new things. A student would be exposed to new people and new situations they may have never encountered before,for this could allow students to gain better people skills and be able to communicate with students and other people. Students may be uncomfortable with the whole process at first, but then they may form a likeness for it and the council may be the most exciting experience for them. This was only one example of an extracurricular activity that can help you find a new thing that can secretly interest you. Almost all extracurricular activities can help sprout a new intrest in you because they are all different, and they can respond to the personalities of a bunch of different people.

In conclusion, students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it can lead to a better, and more successful life, a more positive and helpful friend group, and they can help someone become interested in something they have never tried before. There are very little negatives involving activities that you do outside of school; this is because they are all meant to give students a fun and calming place to try new things. There is a extracurricular activity for everyone, so each student should participate in at least one. If every student participate in a extracurricular activity then the school would be a better place, and students would have a better personality, and there would be a greater atmosphere in the school.",0,0.0076005375,0,True

I disagree with the fact that students may bring their cell phones to school . Students may over use the freedom of bringing the phone to school.

When people drive a car it releases gases into the air and breaks down our ozone layer that protects us from harmful rays from the sun. Limiting car use helps by decreaseing the gases into the air. People all over the world are helping prevent the usage of cars in many ways.

Some people are saying that cars make them tense and by walking it makes them happier and more relaxed. They dont have to stress about putting gas in the car or driving safely. They are also trying to ""make cities denser, and better for walking""(article 1 paragraph 6) Puting stores closer to areas with a higher population so people can walk to them helps.

People are now hopeing to get ""plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers"" This will help bennifit the environment by decreasing the air pollution in the air.

Car- free Day is Spinning into a Big Hit in Bogota . They want to show people there are several other ways to get somewhere without useing a car.

fb2d565c,"Dear senator, Imagine it being the year for choosing for a new president for the United States of America. You cast your vote, for which president you thought that would be best to run our country. After, you hear the results you become very disappointed , Because the president won not by the popular vote but by the electoral college. You become very angry and frustrated because the president that will now be running for America will not better our country by the things he said. Reasoning, that he won by the electoral college and not by popular vote, and you feel as if you dont feel as if it was not fair because you're not really choosing based on the state laws and how the electors are selected. How would you feel if you were in a situation like this ?

Furthermore, i think we should change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States of America. My reasoning being said is because when the president wins by popular vote it's from what the american citizens want, not what the electors chose. When you choose by popular vote you also avoid many other things from occurring. For example, the electoral college is a method of selecting the president that may turn off voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying for their state. As explained in the text "" voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election."" Moreover, the electoral college is unfair to voters. candidates dont spend as time in states they know they have no chance of winning, and only focusing on the states that they do. As said in the text "" In a 2000 campaign , seventeen states dont see the candidates at all, including in rhode island and south carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didnt get to see a single campaign ad. Making that hard for the people to see what there president wants to do for the country they have no idea because of the candidate too worried on winning and letting the citizens choose.

To elaborat on my claim, the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The disaster factor is what happened in the 2000 fiasco which was the biggest election crisis in a century , which allows the system for much worse. In the electoral college state legislatures are responsible for picking electors, and those electors would effect the will of the citizens. sometimes ""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever thet please."" Making another reason why the electoral college should'nt be here to stay.

Although, keeping the electoral college may not be a good thing to do.",0,0.006849115,0,True
E317D1070D4F,"This is what schools do not want parents to know. Kids attending a regular school waste time in every class they have, it could simply be waiting for another student who didnt complete the homework and had to catch up or a teacher waiting for students to quiet down. Even kids switching classes, at Generic_School we have seven minutes to get to our next class, thats almost thirty minutes of unavoidable time lost every day. Some kids who are seen as less popular at school see school as a extremely stressful place. There are also many upsides to going to a standard public or private school, the most important, the social situations. At school kids are forced to be in uncomfortable social situations from time to time, this is very helpful to get acclimated to all types of behavior before walking out in to the real world. Although Schools keeps kids social, online classes gives students freedom of learning speed, allows they to focus better and lets students learn in a more conferrable environment.

The ability to take online classes from home gives kids freedom of learning speed. They can learn at their own pace, whether thats slower or faster than that pace at school, it would ensure that what they are learning has more of a lasting imprint in their memory. This would also give students the ability to take complete and fruitful notes. Its very common for teachers at standard schools to go through notes slides on PowerPoint was to quickly, only giving kids the chance to copy down the main ideas with very few details. This isnt all bad, it can lead students to understanding the bigger picture. The issue is that not all classes require students to know the bigger picture, more often than not, they are required to know many specific details and facts that may not have been copies down. Some may argue that teachers can post the notes on BlackBoard or Google Classroom, but this requires students to commit even more of their day to getting notes that should not have needed such a severe time commitment to acquire, also adding even more stress in to a students schedule. The most difficult aspect of school is struggling to keep up in one of a students more difficult class. This causes kids to feel stupid, and if they fall behind it causes them to feel even worse about themselves.

Another huge advantage of online classes are that the students have an environment completely distraction free. It allows students to make the best use of their time. It could cut out so much time in fact they could end up ahead of what they would have been in a standard school. Also able to allow to students having more time to relax and sleep which is not very common in many highschoolers. Students knowing that the faster and more efficiently they work, they will be rewarded more free time is very motivating. Where many students at standard school just count down the minutes until the nest class until its finally time go home. They know that they wont get home any sooner of they work hard so they dont. Teachers may argue that students reward is a good grade, but nowadays a student can have average grades and still get into a good college if they simply do well on their SAT and ACT. By average grades I mean all A's, B's and possibly one C, but this is only if the students take honors or AP classes. If kids arent rewarded for their hard work they tend not to be committed to doing so.

The final main advantage of taking classes online is that a student can learn in a completely conferrable stress free environment. Some kids who are seen as weird or 'unpopular' are bullied or looked down upon at standard school. This stresses kids out on top of the regular stresses of school this is over the top for some kids. Other students can also stress about how they look which shouldnt be relevant when trying to learn at school. All these unseen stress factors can build up within a student which is very distracting as well as can make them feel trapped. Therefore its important to many kids to learn in a conferrable safe environment. A non stressful environment makes students want to do their best and when students want to do there best they see just how smart they really are, causing them want to keep learning and excel. Their are many students who would benefit from taking online classes but other who are acclimated to a more social life would feel happier and more upbeat in a standard school. Even though having friends in all your classes can be very distracting, it makes those students more conferrable meaning those student would be better off attending standard school.

Even through school prepares kids for the real social world online classes gives students freedom of learning speed, allows they to focus better and lets students learn in a more conferrable environment. Kids who feel overly stressed at school would greatly benefit from online classes were as others werent. I believe that it should be offered every where and kids would have the ability to pick but there should be a feature on the online schools website that allows you to talk to or communicate with other kids taking the same or similar online classes. This way there is still some social interaction for these kids. And they students doing online school should also be required to partner up with another online scholar to complete projects once a month. this way they still get some what of social interaction which is the one and only disadvantage of taking online classes. therefore the students will have the ability to learn at their own pace in a environment they are conferrable in with no distractions so that they can fully focus. ",0,0.0067479517,0,True
AA90439F8B92,"Summer Projects

Summer is full of learning and educational experiences. It is these experiences that stay with a person throughout their life. They shape who a person is and what they know. Schools sometimes require that students do a summer assignment. Why? It helps students learn what they need to, for their new classes, and reflect on these experiences. Summer projects differ in schools, for example, some schools have teacher-designed summer projects and other schools have student-designed summer projects. Schools should make these summer projects teacher-designed because students would take the assignment more seriously, have all students be on the same page on what they need to know, and would better prepare them for life outside of high school.

The first reason, that schools should make summer projects teacher-designed is because students would take their assignment more seriously. As students in high school, students are more likely to do something if an authority figure tells them to do so. For example, if a mom asks her daughter to clean her room then her daughter is more likely going to clean her room because her mom, the authority figure, told her to do so. It is because of the authority and respect that the teacher holds that the student would actually do the work and get a better grade. As one can see, students would take the assignment more seriously if a teacher were to design the summer assignment.

Another reason, that summer projects should be teacher-designed is because all of the students would be on the same page of what they need to know. When all of the students are given the same assignment from the teacher all the students know the same amount of information, but if students did their own assignments each student would be learning different information. For example, it is hard to study for a test when one doesn't even know what all is going to be on it. With the teacher-designed summer projects all students would know what they have to learn before class which would help students have the background knowledge that they may need for the class. Naturally, schools should have the summer projects be teacher-designed because it would help students be on the same page as everyone else in the class.

A final reason, that these projects should be teacher-designed is because it would better prepare students for the real world. The teacher-designed projects would help prepare a student for a job in the future. For example, if one has a really strict boss and they have to do a big job for their boss then they need to know that they need to manage their time well and do it correctly, unless they want to get fired. It is projects like this that helps students to know to manage their time and follow the directions of their boss to get the job done. As one can see, these projects should be teacher-designed because is would help students after they graduate high school.

Many people may say that student-designed summer projects are better because it helps students be less stressed. Although this may be the case, it is less stressful because students are not making their project complex. Students over the summer don't tend to think about school work during summer break until the end and it is with this that students, very last minute, decide to throw something together for their project. If students were told ahead of time by teachers students would know exactly what needed to be done and are more likely to manage their time and spread out their work. It is with the process, teachers making the summer assignments, that students would better understand and learn to manage their time wisely. As evidence provides, teachers should design the summer projects because it would help students manage their time better and get their work done.

In conclusion, schools should have teachers design the summer assignment because students would take their assignment more seriously, have a better understanding of what they need to know, and would prepare them for the real world. The teacher- designed project would help students be more responsible and independent. Imagine what the society in which we live would be like if students would be responsible and be able to do projects like this. Our society would prosper as a whole, education would be valued more, and summer would be a time for learning. The society in which we live would be better for everyone. ",0,0.007042903,0,True
DB48F47BB981,"A large majority of the population has a smart phone or some other devise like it. A lot of these people think they cannot live without their phone being on their person. This causes people to be distracted while driving, and causing crashes. They do have other things they can use like the hands free in their cars. They also have the very high possibility of being pulled over and given a ticket by police. All these are more than enough reason to stop driving with a phone.

In America 28% of the crashes happen because of a phone using distracted driver. This is freighting to me because all it takes is one person on their phone to crash into someone else and possibly take their life. This is a danger to anyone and their vehicle on the roadways making people unconfident while driving. Motorcyclist also have an even greater danger as they are harder to see even for non-distracted drivers so the danger is multiplied.

In 2019 most cars on the road have a hands-free devise built in to the car. This helps many people not use their phone and keep his or her eyes on the road. A lot of people that text and drive may not even know such a thing exists, but if they use this then they will greatly reduce the chance of a fatal crash.

A lot of states now have laws against having your phone in your hand while driving at all now. You will run the risk of getting pulled over and receiving a ticket with a large fine from them. I am glade that they do this as it makes people think twice before picking up their phone for an unnecessary text and causing an accident. People need to realize that other people's lives are not less important than their phones.

In conclusion I believe that people should not be able to use their phones in the car. Using the phone can cause you to be distracted and lose control of your car. There are safer ways of going about this like use the cars hands-free systems. And finally the fact that you could be given a ticket should make you think twice before using your phone. There is just too much at risk to be driving distracted.   ",0,0.007301948,0,True
CEEFCBFE54E4,"Dear Principle,

I agree that students should have at least a B grade to participate in school sports and activities.

Many schools across the country have many talented athletes, but going to school is to help there education get stronger. So in my opinion, education first, then sports and activities.

First off, school is a place where children and young adults can learn and get educated. Most students average, but there's always the ones that may slack off, or not care. I think it is a reasonable policy for kids to have at least a B grade level to participate in school sports and activities.

Having this policy can very must so motivate students to do better in school and try harder. Its also a good lesson to have kids have to reach for what they want. You cant always get what you want, but everyone has to work for something. So, as a student, I agree that having a policy for playing sports and other activities with a B grade level is a good idea. A grade B level is above average, and having that letter grade as the lowest grade is a good idea because then some kids can be so motivated and work hard enough to get an A! Or maybe for some students getting a B is a very good grade, either way this policy can motivate kids to reach for goals to do what they want.

This policy may also keep kids responsible, if they know that they have a soccer game or basketball game coming up they have to be responsible enough to keep their grade level as is or get it up so they can participate. This policy will help kids become or stay responsible with working for what they want or remembering homework, tests, quizzes, etc. anything that is going on in a child's education should be the first thing they should worry about.

This policy is a good lesson for working hard to get what you want. It can teach kids so that later in their future they can understand that you cant always get what you want, that there is always something to work for to get it. It will also help kids make goals for themselves so that they can understand the consequences for not allowing themselves to do the best they could have done.

So, as a student I agree to this policy because its a motivation to do good in school, it help kids stay responsible, and it teaches a good lesson on working hard to get what you want. So again, I very much so agree to this policy.",0,0.0070040277,0,True
95A6AB619F10,"Imagine a school where no student feels left out and everyone has a group of friends where they belong. The students are genuinely happy to be in school, are generally in a good mood, and are also doing well academically. This would be the result of all students participating in an extracurricular activity. An extracurricular activity is any activity that someone does outside of school, like sports, working on the yearbook committee, or serving on the student council. Our principal should require students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it will encourage students to make friends and develop new skills.

Requiring students to participate in extracurricular activities gives them the opportunity to make new friends. Anyone who has been a part of a team or club knows that when someone is a part of a group, they form friendships that can last. Additionally, students who were always too afraid to be themselves at school would have a second chance at doing so by buiding confidence. Having friends is important because friends can make a person happier overall and give them a sense of belonging. Making friends outside of school will also earn them more friends in school. Soon, the empty nearby seats at the lunch table will be occupied with people that a student met at one of their extracurricular activities. Some people may not be very social at school, but participating in an activity outside of school will give them the chance to speak up and form strong friendships.

Whether a student is interested in doing sports, cooking, or participating in an academic competition for their extracurricular activity, they will develop several important skills along the way. The most obvious skill they will develop: being able to do that particular activity. However, students will also develop leadership skills, collaboration skills, and many other skills that can be applied to tasks and activities that they will do in the future. For example, one extracurricular activity that I participate in is dance. Dance has taught me how to work well in a team because I have to work with the other girls in my group to create unified movements. Dance has also taught me leadership skills and teaching skills because I often teach dance classes for the students at a lower level. I have the responsibility of deciding what they need to accomplish that day, and then executing it. Like dance, extracurricular activities can teach students important skills, that will benefit them in school and in the future.

In the end, requiring students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity will only benefit them by giving them the opportunity to make new friends and develop important skills. If someone is marked as the ""shy kid"" at school and doesn't have friends, participating in an extracurricular activity will build their confidence to speak up and make friends. Extracurricular activities can also teach students important life lessons and give them skills that will improve their work and relations in school and in the future. All in all, requiring students to take extracurricular activities is a decision that at first glance seems terrible because it takes away the students' freedom, but in reality, it will have many positive effects on their lives.",0,0.006999549,0,True
C977338F6A53,"It has been proven, that schools that have summer projects verse schools that don't have on average a 15% higher testing average on finnal exams. All schools, except year around schools, have a nine week period where students are given a break from school and enjoy doing other activitys. During the summer many student take a break from school and explore more intrest, or get a summer job, or some even travel, ect. While summer can be a great experience for students, many students tend to lose valuable information that they learn the year prior. This causes teacher to have to review material from the previous year for the first couple of weeks during the new school year. To compact this issue many schools have started assigning summer projects, that helps students retain some of valuable information and make the transiton back to school easier. Most summer projects are teacher- designed , which mean that teacher come up with the concept of the project and have set expectations for that project. Althought some may believe otherwise my experience, the experience of friends, and the experience of classmates helps prove that summer projects should be student-desighned.

Based on my personal experience, summer projects should be student-designed. Last year I was assigned to write an essay based on shadowing experience of a career of your chosing. This was a student-designed project because students got the option to write about whatever particular career fasinated them. At first it was dificult to decide what career I wanted to chose, but in the end I ended up shadowing at a veterinary clinic. This was one of the best decisions I made, because it not only helped show me a potential career I might want to pursue, but also a major I might want to study in college. If this project was teacher designed and I was forced to write about a partiular subect I had no intrest in, then I might have never found out about my passion for helping for animals. While some may argue that teacher-designed project are more useful for the subject course, my student- designed project was more important because it helped me discover some new intrest, and it is important that schools help students discover what intrest them.

The experience of my friends Generic_Name and Generic_Name help prove that summer projects should be student-designed. Generic_Name summer project require her to complete a question and answer packet based on the first four chapters of the text book. Generic_Name project was to come up with a unique way of presenting the first four chapter to the class, so that they better understood the material. In the end, Generic_Name waited untill the last three days of summer to complet her packet, and ended up not full understanding the concept of the textbook. On the other hand, Generic_Names project required more work and time, which ment that she needed to not only start sooner, but also come up with a schedual that allowed her to finish before the project was due. This project helped Generic_Name develope better time management skills, and she ended up better understanding the concept as well. Some may arugue that the amount of work and time ashely spent on the project verses Generic_Name simple packet that didnt take as much time or effort wasnt as vauluable, but Generic_Name grades ended up suffered the first quarter due to her poor understanding of the material, and poor time mangement skills.

My classmate Generic_Name helps show the importance of student-directed projects. Generic_Names summer assignment was to present a worldly issue that impacts a country of his chosing to the class. This was a student-directed project because Generic_Name got to decide how he was not only going to direct the project, but what topic and country he would do. At first Generic_Name found this tasks quite dificult, and decided to gather a few of his friends to help eachother with the project. Generic_Name and his friends decided to do the same worldly impact but for diffrent counties. Without the colaboration of him and his friends, Generic_Name wouldn't have been able to excute the project as well as he did. Working together is always better than working alone, because it allows for people to show diffrent perspectives that you alone might not have taught of. Generic_Name also stated ""if it was not for the help of my group I would have give up on the project' which helps show the importance of a support system. Although some may want to state that a teacher-directed projects are more insightful, working together increases a student responsibility skill and willingness to do the project because they have a duty to your group to finish the project.",0,0.007172843,0,True

214A19342774,"The Electoral College is a easy, yet hard way of a candidate becoming the President of the United States. The Electoral college was created by how ever many majority of the electoral votes will become the new president. This brings many issues within the U.S. . The popularity vote does not matter in a situation like this and is not likely relied on to decide who the president will be. The Electoral College is not right, it's unfair, and is very controversial. The argument though is that with the Electoral College the votes which are dominant have a better chance of the two nominees not having the same amount of votes rather than if it was relied on by the popularity votes. This still though does not resolve nor question that the Electoral College needs to be replaced.

Initially, the Electoral College is not right at all. The electoral votes in the U.S. combined throughout all the states equals 538 votes. Popularity votes which are votes that have an advantage of the election are more than tens of thousands if not more. This is an example on how the Electoral College works. An example of this is in the source by ""Reasons to keep our despised method of chooosing the President"" it states, "" Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only 42 percent of the popularity vote but won through the electoral votes because they had bigger states voting for them making them win that election"". This shows how the Electoral College is not right and should reverse the value of electoral and popularity voting(Poshner, 22).

Additionally, the Electoral College voting is very unfair because many sources giving have shown to people that many candidates have had less popularity vote but have won through the majority of the electoral votes. This is unfair because popularity votes mean popularity votes which are votes that are of the majority of all votes. Unfortunately, the popularity votes do not count. As said in the source ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" it states, "" if you wanted to vote for John Kerry and you lived in Texas the vote would go to 34 Democratic electors that pledged to Kerry"". This is why popularity vote should be the deciding factor of who becomes the next President. If every election would be based on popularity vote the candidate won each of those elections would probably all change due to the fact that so many elections have won based on electoral vote(Plumer,10).

To end with, the Electoral College is so controversial. Out of more than two hundred years of elections many have been close and many have been a mile away from each other. The electoral vote decides it all though. The main problem with this process is how it is set-up. The electoral vote is dominent over the popular vote, but it shouldnt be. The electoral vote has made bad decisions yet good decisions throughout the hundreds of years its been around and the main reasin for electoral votes are to keep the candidates running not have the same number of votes so that they won't have to have another election and voting cast. ""It is also really controversial since the voting also might rely on the political party that the candidate is running for"", as  stated by ""What is the Electoral College"". This Electoral College seems to go by how big the state is, the bigger the state the more electoral votes that state has; the smaller the state the less electoral votes that that state has(Federal Register, 5).

In conclusion, the Electoral College is unaccurate, lazy, unreasonable, yet successful. This process by many sources of evidence have concluded that there are in fact many holes in this system. Yet some sources have proved how the Electoral College has helped decide the outcomes and have stopped run-off elections. The Electoral College is unfair, not right and controversial and has also proved that it has pros to all these cons as well.     ",0,0.0072347494,0,True

You turn to your elder brother Generic_Name for advice, Generic_Name says you should take her out for shopping, then, take her to get her nails done, or maybe take her to the salon.

55073BB23596,"In the article "" Making Mona Lisa Smile, "" the author describes how a new technology called Facail Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. I believe the Facail Action Coding System can greatly help a classroom. This type of technology can really improve the students' education. It can also help the teacher in some certain ways. This technology could also change our future in teaching.

First, this Facail Action Coding System can greatly help a students' education by knowing their emotions. As the article said, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". This is helpful, becasue the teacher now knows what student is confused or bored. By the teacher knowing, he or she would be able to asist the student. This would benefit the student.

Second of all, the Facail Action Coding System can really benefit a teacher. It can benefit a teacher, becasue the teacher would be able to know who is bored or confused. For example, if the teacher knows that most of the class is bored. Then the teacher can modify the lesson, to make it more effective. This is why I think it can greatly help the teacher.

Finally, I really believe this kind of technology can change the way the schools teach. If people start puting Facail Action Codying Systems in schools, and they see improvment in grades for students. It will spark other ideas for these types of technogy. Like what the article siad for the Facail Action Coding System,""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""

56B4E3A8FA68,"Teachers exclusivley should design summer assignments to apply tools and characteristcs nessicary to reveiw or learn in the upcoming year. This will not only educate students what they need to reivew, but also the new expectations and allow them a preveiw on the types of assignments the individual teacher assigns. Summer asignments should be teacher designed to educate sutudents on what is to be expected in the following year.

Over the summer, students have a tendency to forget informantion they learned in the past year(s). Summer assignments allow for students to still have time off from school, but also insure they are still learning and not loosing information needed in their next school year. By making the project teacher designed, the educator can make sure the project is outlining previously taught tools, information, and possibly new skills they will need in their class in the fall; something that may potentially be missed or not fully appied if student design their own projects.

Expectations and types of assignments/projects vary from teacher and year. The purpose of summer assignments should be not only to make sure students are still learning and retaining information, but to also give the student a preveiw of the teachers teaching/assignment style, level of diffeculty of the class, and grading rubric. This way, it benifits the student in more way than one and completely prepares them for the class expectations of the following year. Therefore, it is essential the teacher themselves designs the project for the benifit of the student in all such elements.

Some may disagree that the individual student should design their own summer project because it insures the student is learning while getting some enjoment and individuality. However, if the students themselves design the project, it is not garanteed they will apply information and tools vital for next year. Even if they are given a rubric specifically outlining the nessicary elements needed within the project, the assignment will still be lacking an example of the types of projects the teacher is likely to assign in the future, the teachers educating style, and will not exibit the true difficulty of the class. The student will still be able to show their personality through their work within the teacher designed project, so it will still display individuality; but at the same time preparing them for the teachers class specifically.

Summer projects are helpful in the fact it assures students are still learning over break, but if exclusively the teacher designs it can similtaniously also be very helpful in outlining previously taught tools/ information they need in the following year, teacher and class expectaitions, as well as displaying both teacher and student personality. Summer asignments should be teacher designed to educate sutudents on what is to be expected in the following year.      ",0,0.006854913,0,True
67D40BFD6844,"Dear Mrs. Principal:

I am writing to inform you that in my opinion, all students should be required to complete a certain amount of community service each year. I think that community service can improve character and also encourage students to help others. Many schools across the country have begun to require a certain amount of community service hours as part of their final grades.

As far as improving character goes, I believe community service can be a huge help. If a student volunteers picking up trash, they will have someone in charge of giving them directions for where and when to pick up trash. They will be required to respect this person and obey this person's instructions, which is what students must do in school very often. I believe that students are purposefully resistant towards teacher and administration figures, but if they have someone outside of school teaching them respect and obedience, their tendency to respect authority figures in school will be stronger.

I also believe community service can build character because of the impact that it can have on your life. Some children have never experienced the feeling of accomplishment when they know they have done something to help another person. If you choose to volunteer in children's hospital, the reactions from the sick children you are helping can be truly inspiring. I think this teaches kids to be grateful, thus building character.

In conclusion, I believe community service can only benefit students in this school. I believe the overall school behavior would improve and I believe we would grow stronger as a school community. Therefore, I think all students should be required to complete a certain amount of community service each year.",0,0.12622947,0,True

F00FF00D5C8F,"Are you the kind of person that is really interested in political stuff? Politics can be a subject that will start fights, but not everyone is so interested. You must know what the electoral college is. It is a system where when you vote for your president you are actually voting for a group of electors that will then vote for the president(Source 1). This means that even if there is a majority in the popularity vote from the people. The electoral college can over rule that and vote for the other. Some say the electoral college is good because it prevents ties or because it will make sure there is a winner. But if they can over rule your vote are you really voting for your president? I say the electoral college is a bad system and it needs to be extinguished.

There is no doubt that you should get to decide who your leader will be. And if the electoral college can over rule your vote do you really feel like it's your decision? In the 2000 presidential race, Al Gore lost because he recieved the most popularity votes from the people but the electoral college voted for Bush instead(Source 2). This means that the people thought Al Gore should be the president but instead they didn't get what they wanted because the electoral college thought otherwise. Do you think this is in anyway fair? The majority of the country ended up unhappy with the election because of ther electoral college. I say that alone is enough reason to abolish the electoral college. If it happens once it can happen again. Do you want to feel cheated and betrayed again? Let's get rid of the electoral college!

Some others may say that they support the electoral college because it can't have a tie. ""Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality ina state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state.""(Source 3). It is still possible to have a tie though because there are 538 total votes and since that is an even number then it can happen. And if there is just a stlight difference and instead the electoral college creates a landslide then that isn't representing the actuall number of the votes by the people. Once again you are being cheated out of your sya it the election. The hardest thing to understand is why people would still support something that doesn't support them. The electoral college basically throws away your votes and replaces them with theirs. And once again, it is possible for ties in the electoral college due to the even number of votes.

""Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much to say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters.""(Source 2). This alone shows that your votes are being represented equally. It is saying that 500,000 votes are equal to 35 million votes. Isn't it obvious that those two numbers are very different and they could have a very large effect on the popularity of each canidate that they are voting for? but instead they have they same effect and the 34.5 million voters that don't get their fair say could very possibly be unhappy with the turnout of the president. The people are supposed to be the ones that vote for their leader, not a group of 538 ""qualified"" polititians that can over rule the entire country's vote. It's ridiculous how the system works and you are crazy if you support it. I know i want my fair share of input and the electoral college won't allow that.

There are supporters who say that they support the electoral college because it avoids run-off elections. Because even if there is a tie in the majority votes from the people it is unlikey for there to be a tie in the votes from the electoral college. ""For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the electoral College...""(Source 3). In my opinion if there is a tie in the popularity votes then they should revote, it may take longer but it will still be a decision by the people. Just because it makes the procces faster doesnt mean it makes the procces better. They can create a better system in the event of a tie instead of electors over ruling the people and picking whoever they think is best. That isnt government for the people, by the people.

In conclusion, the electoral college needs to be extinguished for many reasons. those reasons are because it doesn't let the people vote for who they want and it over rules a notions votes. And because it doesnt show the number of votes as equall. Some may say that it is good because it prevents a tie but if there is a tie then I'm sure htere are better ways to revote. we need government for the people, by the people and that isn't what the electoral college is.

91763ded,"Everyday when you wake up and get ready for work there's always one thing you use, it's inched it's way into your daily life and now you wouldn't be able to do most things without it. It's your four wheeled friend that sits out in your driveway or garage, your car. Every day millions of people drive miles and miles in a car, using them to go to work or to go and see other people, but what people don't understand is the need to limit just how much they use their automobile companions.

Cars have changed our lives for the better and for the worse. They save us a tremendous amount of time by making traveling super efficient, but along with that is air pollution. Cars emit greenhouse gasses, and these gasses trap heat which in then leads to warming of the surface of the earth. This warming of the earth creates drastic changes in many environments such as the polar regions. ""Passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe... and up to fifty percent in some car intensive areas"" This was stated in an article about German suburb life without cars. By limiting the amount of which we drive and by switching to alternative sources for transportation we can lower the amount of greenhouse gases and stop the heating of the earth.

Furthermore, these gases create smog. Smog is similar to fog but instead it has gases emitted from cars in it. Smog is usually thick and can be hazardous to environments. It was so bad in Paris that they set a partial driving ban in which people couldn't not drive because they didn't want the smog to get worse. The problem here is that people still continued to drive out even though there was a ban being enforce. So, this is another issue in which cutting back on car uses can fix. If we switch to biking to places that are withing biking distance or walking to place that are walking distance than we wouldn't have to worry about smog, or bans.

Automobiles have changed the way we live our lives and the way we do things, but they also have changed our communities. The typical city today consists of tall buildings and a surplus of streets and avenues, but parks are not as common. In Bogota there has been celebrating a day without cars for three years, and it has seen changes in the community. By having everyone give up their car for a day it can change their view on things, can make them notice things about the place in which they live in that they did't know about before. It can show them the beauty of their surroundings and this can lead to people wanting to protect that beauty and improve their city. This can be done in the form of building parks, and fixing uneven sidewalks.

So all in all, we depend on cars for daily purposes and it may seem hard to let go of your keys and walk, but if we all do that every once in a while it can lead to tremendous benefits. Imagine if you could walk outside and see people walking and enjoying themselves, not having to worry about gas prices or traffic jams. Imagine if we didn't have to worry about greenhouse gases or smog. Going for walk instead of driving may not seem like much, but it has major impacts on a multitude of things.",0,0.007409447,0,True
F6DA839FE9AF,"With technology making advancements everyday, it is natural that we adapt and adopt new forms of technology in our lifes, houses, hospitals, schools and even prisons,however, some technologies might get too far into our lives and into our heads.

A new software developed at the University of Illinois promises to read and detect facial expressions that reveal how we felt at the moment the picture or camera footage was recorded. The project is now in early stages of development but is already able to read paintings and describe what they feel.

In his text ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", Nick D'Alto states that "" if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow."", stating that the software can be used to monitor people and detect what products they take interest in, which is an unethical way to push companies into people's lives; moreover, the author claims that students can have their facial expressions monitored so that if they become bored, the computer can adjust the lesson to make it more engaging to the student. Although students have different needs, the usage of surveilance to capture their interest can be compared to the way babies are shown colorful and animated things to keep their attention, which can make the student's attention span even smaller than it has become, alienating and making them more dependant of technology.

In conclusion, the usage of this software to either sell products or monitor students is unethical at the least, and can lead to an even more alienated population.   ",0,0.03233511,0,True

Since children use technology so much, why not make them use it for educational purposes? If they could use their devices as educational resources, they would learn so much more. Many schools are debating whether students would benefit from taking their classes from home using their computers or other devices. Students would benefit more from taking classes from home rather than school because, they can learn at their on pace, be in a comfortable environment, and it teaches students more then just the curriculum.

To start off, teachers in schools teach at a fast pace and continue without the year whether all the students understand or not. By being able to take classes online at home, students will be able to take their time to really understand the curriculum. Most students cannot retain information in a ninety minute class period, moving from topic to topic without a check for understanding. Failing grades and test scores are a result of the lack of understanding the material. Today, most students do not fully learn; they try to do enough to just pass. Allowing students to take classes at home will not only improve their grades, but make schools bout learning again.

Secondly, students would be able to learn in a comfortable environment. It can be hard to focus on learning if a person is not comfortable in the room they are in. Most schools are older which means the classrooms are not the best. The rooms are small with dim lights and little to no windows. The dirty cement walls and moist air makes it harder to focus. While at home, students have fresh air and decorated rooms that they feel comfortable in. A person's environment can change their mood and thought process. A good, comfortable environment, in which people feel safe in, expands the mind and eagerness to learn. A good learning environment is critical to education.

In addition to the previous statement, taking classes from home teaches students more then just the curriculum. For example, by taking online classes from home, it teaches students how to prioritize and manage their time better. Students would have to make their own schedule and plan when they will get their assignments done as well as having a personal life. Students will learn how to use technology for more than just social media and games. It gives insight on how life will be once they graduate and have a career. Online classes give them control of their education which prepares them for life outside of school.

In conclusion, there are many reasons why students would benefit from taking online classes. Most students would love the opportunity to be able to take their classes from home. It is more convenient for students and families who need their child to work or take care of the household. This is a great way to prepare students for future careers and life in general.

DE0F442888D2,"Dear Principal,

Your considering changing school policy so that students may not participate in school sports or other activities unless they have at least a B average, and I as a student think that is a good idea and should be put in order as soon as possible. Kids who are looking forward to school sports should strive to get bring up their grades because once the time come and practice for these sports take place after school, students will find it hard to get there homework done and turned in on time.

Not getting homework finished will lower their grade, and if they're required to have a B average instead of a C average, then when ever a grade falls it will fall to a C which is still pasting. If the required grade average is a C then when and if their grade falls, even just a little it will most likely fall to a D which is failing and could potentially cause them to be held back.

On the other hand if students are required to have a B average to participate in school sports they later in the future may stay to those standards in high school where there is a great chance with the grades and the sports, a possible scholarship could be handed to them to get into collage.

368B08009A56,"Have you ever thought about what life would be like on the planet of Venus? Over the years, scientists and astronomers have been studying if Venus is able to substain life. Even with the temperatures of up to eight-hundred degrees farenheight and with an atmospheric pressure that is ninety times greater than what we experience on Earth, I see why the author thinks that pursuing this journey will be worth it.

One reason why I think the author is for pursuing the journey to Venus is because of the analogous features that Earth and Venus share. In paragraph four of the text, the author states that the surface contains of a ""rocky sediment"" and ""includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" This is crutial to the author's point because it shows how, in many ways, Earth and Venus are so much alike. Just as the author questions, ""If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussin furthur visits to its surface?""

One of NASA's possible solutions is another reason why I feel the author thinks it is worth the trip to Venus. This solution is described as sending a spaceship to outer space to hover about thirty or more miles above the surface. According to the article, ""...temperature would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level."" The article also implies that there would be plenty of energy through solar power and would be survivable, but with rough conditions.

Even with the advanced technology that we have today, scientists are beginning to look back and discover that mechanical computers that were used back in the 1800's and 1900's might just be the technology that we need to study Venus. According to the text, ""...systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces."" The advanced technology that we have today is not meant to be used in conditions such as Venus has. With this being said, these mechanical computers could be very important in studying our pursuit to Venus in the future.

In conclusion, the exploration to Venus could be very dangerous or very benefitial to the future of space exploration. Though, with the similiarities between Earth and Venus, the possible approach of hovering the planet, and using technology that will substain such conditions all are reasons why this journey could be worth the danger.

36CC2A1A8BBC,"Your friend asks you a question and you give them an answer. They then say that the person that they asked before you said something different. You start wondering why they didn't just use the opinion of the first person they asked. Why did they ask me after asking them? Sometimes seeking the opinion of more than one person can be proven to be substantial. The person you ask may not always be the right person to answer the question. There are a bunch of reasons/answers that could influence you to make a decision. So... Why should you seek the opinion of multiple people in order to make a better choice? Well getting the opinion or answer of multiple people is important because there could be someone with better knowledge about the topic, the people you ask might have different things to say, and/or one persons opinion could be invalid or favored to one thing or another.

When I say that there might be someone with better knowledge about the topic, I mean that someone might have a better thought out and reasonable answer. For example if you ask someone if they think that Football is safe to play. Would you to ask a middle school student who plays Football for their school or a coach of an NFL team? I'm not saying that the middle school football players opinion would not be a good one, I am just saying that an NFL coach would have a more informative opinion than the middle school student. Just because someone has the best knowledge for one question doesn't mean they have the best knowledge for all questions. another example would be if you wanted to know something about middle school Football, then you would ask the middle school student who plays Football and not the NFL coach. All that you need and want is to get the best answer possible for your question.

Next, I wanted to bring up that the people you ask might have different things to say. When people you ask say different things then you start to think and do research to figure which answer is really the best. Let's say that your ask three of your friends if homework is a positive or negative item in the community. One of them says that it is positive and the other two say that it is negative. Then they would probably tell you their reasoning as to why they think what they think and have a little debate. When explaining themselves it will cause you to think about what they are saying and by the end you will have the most logical answer. When people express their different feelings/opinions it opens other peoples minds to possibilities about those things.

Finally, I wanted to say that a persons answer/opinion could be invalid or favored. Like when asking someone what the best sports team is they are most likely going to say their favorite sports team. They will say that they favor their team over any others in the league because in their mind that team is the best. The answer/opinion could also be invalid because someone could have influenced their opinion even thought that is not what they think. For example let's say that you are asking people what the best subjects in school are. Someone is thinking that the best subject is math and then their friend comes up to them and tells them that science is the best. In order to make their friend happy they agree with them and say that science is the best rather than math. Now their opinion/answer is invalid.

In conclusion, I think that when getting opinions of others you should not get only one persons but multiple. Not everyone will have the same answer to a question. Getting different thoughts from people can be substantial in making a better choice. Without asking multiple people you may end up with something that not everyone agrees on. You want to make sure that you get the most educated, most valid answer. In order to make you answer the best it can be make sure to consider the different opinions, get the most educated answer, and make sure the answer is not invalid or favored. You also need to make sure that your question is formatted the best way so that the people your questioning/asking understand what your trying to ask. ",0,0.006768129,0,True

The votes are all taken and used to see who is more popular with the people. But who decided who gets to be president is not us. It is the Electoral College. The Electoral College is a group of people in each state who decide the president for us. I think everyone should get to vote on who they want as president, and i think it should actually count. The Electoral College is unfair and I believe popular vote should decide who we get as the president of the nation that we have or rights to vote in.

In the words of Bob Dole ""Abolish the electoral college."" It is unfair, outdated, and irrational. It is unfair because of the winnertakesall system there is in each state. With this in place the candidates take no time in the states they know they have not of chance of winning in. Instead they spend all of their time in states they may have a tight race in. for example, during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states did not see the candidates at all. Twentyfive of the largest media markets did not even get to see a single campaign ad. Under the Electoral College system they do not vote for the president, they vote for a slate of electors who then turn around and vote for the president they want. Is that really fair. That we are putting our nations future in the hands of only 538 people.

Popular votes should be what decides our president. Therefore we actually have a say in who we want to be president. For example, in the 2000 U.S. presidential race, Al Gore recieved more individual votes then George W. Bush nationwide, but because of the Electoral College Bush won because he had 271 electoral votes while Gore had 266. Also in the election in2012 Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral votes comparing to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes. Sure he still would have won but at least individual people actually had a say in who they got as their president. Also in 2012, the popular vote was very close in Florida, but Obama won the electoral vote with 29. But in Wyoming the same thing happened and he only got three electoral votes. This shows a large state gets more attention in presidential candidates than a small state does. If presidency was decided by the individual votes then it wouold be more fair and more poeple would have a say in it.

If this country really gave us the right to vote then we would really have a say in who we want as our president. But the Electoral College is not letting us do that. Only two states do something a little differently, but it still does not make that much of a difference.

307DF96FE1EE,"Have you ever had a hard choice to make? Many people like talking to multiple people before finalizing their decision. This gives them the opportunity to listen to other people. Seeking multiple opinions is a good thing because it gives new perspectives to look at, the chance to weigh out different options, and the ability to learn from past decisions.

When seeking multiple opinions, it allows you to have new perspectives to look at. When you have multiple perspectives, you are able to look at the big picture and see what really is the best option. For example, if you are trying to figure out what food you should have at a party, you want to talk to other people to see what they would like, and that could make your decision much easier. Talking to other people may make you feel less stressed because someone may say something that you hadn't thought of, and that could be the perfect answer to solve a certain problem. A new perspective is an advantage when listening to other people's view on the specific situation.

Another thing that you could get out of talking to multiple people is that you get the chance to weigh out your different options. When weighing out each option/opinion, you are able to look at the pros and cons of the different perspectives. While looking at the pros and cons, some people may be able to combine multiple ideas, or potentially it could spark a new idea. If weighing out each option sparks a new idea, it can give you a fresh outlook in the situation you are in. Asking for people's opinion is great because then you are able to find the pros and cons of each opinion.

Another advantage of talking to multiple people is that it gives you the ability to learn. If you are stuck in the same position as you were in the past, people could help you learn from your mistakes. They could help you learn by thinking of a new idea that could prevent the same mistake from happening again. You are able to see where someone is coming from if you disagree on a particular opinion. When talking to people for advice, you are able to learn from other peoples perspectives, even if it interferes with you own.

Overall, when people ask for advice, they like to talk to multiple people,which can come with some advantages. Seeking advice is a good thing because it gives new outlooks on situations, which then gives the opportunity to think of a new idea that could solve the problem. Also, getting advice form different people gives you the chance to look at the pros and cons of each idea to formulate the best option. Listening to other people's opinions can give you the chance to grow, and step out of your comfort zone. These are the some of the many reasons why seeking multiple opinions could overall benefit you.",0,0.8145906,1,False
FAA9FC1B315B,"In my personal opinion when some schools offer distance learning as an option for student to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing I mostly disagree. Its not because I am attending a public high school. There are reasons why I mostly disagree about this situation.

One of the reasons why I disagree is because this might hurt the students communication skills.

when you have classes online you are not at the school you are home taking this class so you basically don't associate with anyone except your teacher now since i have never took a online class i wouldn't be able to tell if its better to not know no one or to associate with anyone but personally I just dont't thing it's good for students to attend online school if you are someone that like to work with people and not just your teacher. Other students also might be able to understand some stuff that you don't understand and that they should be able to help you. They won't be able to help you if you not there with them.

The second reason why I disagree and I really don't think that online schools is not beneficial is that it hurts your participation skills too. Here in school we do so much activities connected to things we are learning and it helps very much because if you do activities connected to the things we are learning it gets stuck in your mind. Its also better to ask questions and to understand better. There might be some stuff that you didn't understand face to face with your teacher its better to ask them like that and understand like that instead of emailing them or contacting them through different thing.

Also the teacher might not respond as soon as possible and that might be a problem and affect your grade and thats why its better to talk to your teacher face to face and deal with understanding face to face that's my second opinion.

My last and final reason is that you might get lazy and miss classes since you take it at your home . That might affect your grade too which is very risky if you're not a productive and committed person to your education online class is not for you. For example me personally it will not be good for me because I am a very lazy person i am pretty sure I will miss classes either by sleeping in or some other unexeptalbe reasons . But also there are people that are very organized and careful people out here that can risk this for those kind of people online classes are good and they can take it because thy are committed to Finnish there education in a very careful way.

Those are my good reason why i don't agree with online classes it's a good thing that schools offer distance learning as an option for students if you have a good reason why you don't actually go to the school but personally i dont agree with this situation.                                            ",0,0.007078828,0,True

D7EFABFA54AC,"The Dangers of Using your Phone and Driving

Recently, Georgia has passed the ""Hands-Free"" law, which states that no driver can use their electronic devices while operating a vehicle. Although it is a law, many people still don't obey this law. Many may think that they can multitask but it's not a very good idea. Drivers shouldn't be able to use their devices while driving for many reasons. A few reasons are that many other lives are at risk, they can get a ticket and it can cause insurance rates to increase.

Depending on how much experience a driver has, they might think that they can trust themselves to multi-task. One out of Four car accidents is caused by a driver who's texting and driving. When a driver gets their phone out and isn't really paying attention to the road, they don't realize that they're putting everyone's lives in that car and many lives out on the road at risk. Car accidents can happen at any time and drivers should at least try to prevent them from happening. No driver should want to be responsible for an accident that takes their or other lives away or pays the price for their actions.

Some people may think that they can't get caught so they continue to do it. Of course, if you disobey the law there will be consequences. For texting, while driving, the fine can be up to

$150 and up to a total of one point on the driver's license. To some people, the fine isn't a problem, but getting points on a license are way worse and it affects everyone. Once points on a license add up, it can cause suspension of the license.

After those consequences, now the insurance company gets involved. When they find out that their client gets a ticket for texting and driving, they will most likely increase the insurance rate. Depending on the insurance company, they will think it's better to just cancel the policy.

Everyone's safety is important on the road. No one should risk their life or anyone's life just to send a text or check how many likes their post got. If a phone call or text message is an emergency, drivers should pull over before answering. Personally, checking it really isn't worth it because you never know what can happen on the road especially when so many people seem to be unfocused and or rushed.         ",0,0.007345921,0,True

Lastly when we vote by Electoral college the citizens dont get to have the full call on who is elected. Now let me tell you more about why popular vote is way more qualified.

We the people may vote with Electoral College, but the vote that is chosen is not only made up by the citizens, but the vote may be changed by the Congress. Now thats not right! The Citizens should have all the vote like popular vote. The Citizens should choose who is voted for because they are the ones who are going to help us. Not be better for them.

We dont get to vote for our candidate's electors. The citizens of the United States sould be able to vote for who we want our candidate's electors to be. This is because if something goes wrong we will have the right to change the electors and be happy about who they are going to be. We cant do that with Electoral Voting.

Lastly when we vote by Electoral college the citizens dont get to have the full call on who is elected. If we dont get the full call on who is elected then why even vote.

""We the people

"" means the citizens not over ride the citizens votes and just do what they want.

F68664C634EE,"The idea of requiring students to participate in extracurricular activities could be beneficial in many ways. Students could have the opportunity to meet new people, develop leadership skills, and find things that interest them. Being involved in extracurricular activities could be a very positive addition and quite an enhancement to a student's life.

Meeting new people through an extracurricular activity is one of the best ways to make friends, because everyone is surrounded by people with similar interests to them. For example, walking into the first day of a club they signed up for, one already knows they have something in common with the rest of the members, making that first conversation less awkward. In a situation where a student feels like they're often left out, or if they don't have many friends, participating in an extracurricular activity gives them more opportunity to make friends and put themselves out there. Being in a club or on a sports team is a great way to meet new people.

Joining clubs or sports teams is also a great way to find interests. A lot of people might assume that to join a club or sports team, one already has to have some sort of skill in that area, which is completely false. If someone wants to join the knitting club even though they have absolutely no idea what it is, but they heard their grandma mention her interest in it one time, and they want to have more things in common with their grandma, that's amazing. If someone wants to join the advanced dodge ball team having never touched a dodge ball in their life, but they just want to improve their reflexes, good for them, they have quite a brave soul. Finding the smallest interest in something at a young age could completely change someone's future and what career they want to pursue.

Developing leadership skills can be very beneficial to one's life. Being a part of the student council, being team captain, or being a club leader can really enhance a student's leadership skills, which is something that could come in handy throughout their entire life. Knowing how to lead a group discussion into making a positive decision is a very important skill to have, especially for a student. If a student just seems like another head in the crowd, developing some leadership skills is a great idea for them and they would really benefit from it. Leadership skills are best to develop in the younger ages because if someone develops them at a student level, it's safe to assume they'll be more successful at their future job than someone who never cared about standing up to something or was never able to propose an idea with confidence.

Enforcing the requirement of students being involved in extracurricular activities is a very smart idea. Students would get the opportunity to meet new people, learn more about themselves while finding what things they're interested in, and develop leadership skills which will be useful to them throughout their entire lifetime. Being involved in extracurricular activities would be a very beneficial thing to a student's life.",0,0.98744917,1,False

Although cell phones have not been around for a very long time, they have become a key part of our lives. People use their cell phones for just about everything such as: texting, talking, schedule planning, internet surfing, etc. Sometimes we can even do two or more of these things at the same time. Unfortunately, people are also choosing the wrong time to be using their cell phones: while they are driving. As a society, we have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can't put down our cell phones. Using a handheld cell phone while driving is dangerous to the driver themselves for a couple of good reasons. Several researchers have proved that using cell phones during driving makes driver more exposed to fatal accidents. Focus of the driver is not on the road or traffic and it becomes difficult to handle phone and vehicle at one time. Cell phones during driving also reduce the mental capacity of drivers as they fail to concentrate on minor or major activities happening around them. As already discussed, cell phones distract drivers' attention resulting in comparatively slow response to traffic signals and other related traffic events. Studies have shown the fact that breaking reaction time is also slower while talking on a cell phone during driving. The perception, vision, general awareness, and concentration of the driver are impacted while communicating on a cell phone during driving. Especially during bad weather or driving on slippery roads, drivers engage in conversation pay less attention to these areas increasing risks of fatal accidents. Although, there are grave negative impacts of using cell phones during driving it is pertinent, for the sake of arguments, to present benefits also. The most important benefit of cell phones during driving is again the security factor.

During emergency situations cell phones can provide help and driver can make emergency calls, even reporting any dangerous scenario such as roadside accidents. Through cell phones a driver can locate the desired route. Furthermore, using FMs on cell phones can provide information about weather and traffic   ",0,0.007708533,0,True

Why People Should Always Get Multiple Opinions

When making an important decision, or just asking for advice, people should always talk to more than one person. Seeking multiple opinions will help them be more successful by giving you more views on a topic. If someone seek multiple opinions, they will make smarter, more knowledgeable and better choices because they will help give you a more accurate response as well as different opinions.

One key reason why someone should ask multiple people for their opinion is because they will get more accurate data. For example, If someone asked one person a question and they answered yes, then they would be more likely to agree with the person that answered, but if they asked ten people and only the first person said yes, then it would be unlikely for them to agree with the person that said yes. This means that people will be more informed when asking multiple people instead of one.

Another reason why someone should ask more than one person is because everyone has a different opinion. Their opinion could be based on their background, beliefs, ethnicity, wealth, gender and many other reasons. This means that it is important to ask multiple people because everyone thinks differently about certain topics. One example would be politics. People often have different political beliefs based on where they live, their race, their wealth, and other factors, because of this, it is important to ask people that are different from you in these categories. They could have a completely different opinion that you have never thought of, and could swing your view on a issue.

Lastly, people that ask multiple other people for their opinions will often be more successful with whatever they are trying to do or achieve. If a someone asks multiple people, then the people asked will help them come to a decision. The decision that will be made will be informed by others that they ask, and will be better than the choice that they would have made if they had no help or advice.

Some people say that if someone asks multiple people for advice, that would mean that they would no longer be come up with an opinion for themselves. This is incorrect because a persons opinion is based on what other people say or do. With out other people to give advice, people would not be able to create the same opinions.

These are multiple reasons talking to more then one person will help you get better advice than if you were to just get one opinion. Asking multiple opinions will give you a more accurate overall view on how people feel about something as well as help someone become more successful. Getting more than one opinion can even help people think about things they had not previously thought about or considered.      ",0,0.009389982,0,True
F44A8B59CF6A,"Driverless cars are starting to be created, and eventually they will be allowed on the streets everywhere. With that being said, that means that there will be more dangers that pedestrians and drivers have to worry about. If one thing went wrong with a driverless car it could potentially cause an accident and leave people injured and/or dead. Without having a driver that is specifically paying attention to the road, you never know what might happen. At any point in time the car could malfunction and nobody would be there to maintain control. Cars are meant to have a driver, and without a driver nobody knows what may happen.

These days, cars that have to have a driver still malfunction and sometimes the driver is not even enough to help keep them from causing an accident. Without a driver this risk would be even larger leaving everyone more concerned about getting into an accident. There should always be someone who is watching the road at all times and if things do start going badly then they are able to fix what is going on.

The longer that driverless cars are around the more that they will be available leaving less manual cars out there. This means that cars will become more expensive due to all of the technology that has to go in the cars to make then drive by themselves. More and more people will have to go without a vehicle because they will not be able to find any that can fit into their budget. Driverless vehicles will ruin the chance of some people getting a newer vehicle due to the rising prices.

If driverless cars continue to only be allowed to go up to speeds of 25 miles per hour and cannot drive by themselves through workzones and around accidents then there is really no point in having them. Many places, even around small towns/cities, have a speed limit higher than 25 miles per hour. The car would be no use and the driver would have to drive the car themselves. Even if the car could drive through anything and go any speed, the person in the drivers seat would have to remain alert at all times because you never know when the car could malfunction and potentially cause an accident.

Even though there are many downfalls of driverless cars, there are also many upsides to them. One of these would be the vibration of the drivers seat in the GM when the vehicle could possibly back into an object. Another thing is the cameras that could watch the person in the drivers seat to make sure that they are watching the road. This would help people stay focused and remain focused while they were in the car. Driverless cars would be very nice, especially for people who have to drive really far or who do not like to drive, but they are not as safe as a real driver.

Technology is becoming so advanced that in just a few years driverless cars will be made and seen on the streets. This puts many people in danger and everyone will have to be more carfeul on the road. Some people that are going to own these cars will not put their full attention on the road, and when the car malfunctions or stop then there will be an accident. These cars will cost a lot more money that many people do not have, leaving them without a car. If driverless cars do become the future there needs to be many laws and requirements made about the car and the person who owns the car.         ",0,0.0075303307,0,True
52D858E1E9D0,"The Electoral College is a process which is between a election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the popular vote of qualified citizens. Why do we need the Electoral College? We need the Electoral College to see what the people want in their opinion. Also, we need it for the problems the Electoral College avoids us from, such as each candidate doesn't recieve a majority of the votes cast.

The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, that wouldn't be fair. The people of the smaller states fell that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no sense of caring for their interests,like he really isn't their president. The bigger states, such as Texas, restores some of the weight in the political balance that larger states lose. So, as we can see a larger state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a smaller state would.

Next, the Electoral College avoids us from things in many ways. For example, Nixon in 68' and Clinton in 92' both had a 43 percent chance plurality of popular votes, while winning a majority of the Electoral College. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. Which means that pressure, which would greatly confuse the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which clearly states the winner. It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president could turn off potential voters that has no hope for carrying their state. So the Electoral College greatly avoids run-off elections.

Therefore, we shall keep the Electoral College in favor for why we need to have it, and how it helps us avoid big situations. So please, let us keep the Electoral College as it helps our country throough political situations and for how it helps us.              ",0,0.0070637055,0,True

The Electoral College is a process not a place. There's nothing wrong wit people voting for the president . Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO, in their time , agreed on? Abolishing the electoral college. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for the slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.

Who picks the electors? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central comittee, sometimes the presidentail canidates themselves. Voters can't controls whom their electors vote for. Well not always .Voters sometimes get very confused about the votes in vote for the wrong canidate.

The best arguement against the electoral college is called Disater Factor. The Americans should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election in a century. Back in 1960, segregations in Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratics with new electors that would oppose John F. Kennedy.

The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the canidates who recieve the most votes. A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible, it happened in 2000, but it's less likely than a dispute over popular vote.

The Electoral College requires a presidential Canidate to have trans-regional appeal. No other region ( South, Northwest, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. The winner takes all method of awarding electoral votes. The electoral College avoids the problems of elections in which no canidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. For an example, nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes.               ",0,0.0071466756,0,True
8FEC3A849513,"Advice is really something you shouldnt take. Advice can we great but the total opposite of what you wanted to hear. People often times give you bad advice as well, so you really should seek out more than one person an opinion on the topic at hand. Seeking multiple persons for advice can often lead you to an overlooked detail ,or a different outcome of the situation.

So say one of my friends decided to jump off of a cliff, but they want to know which cliff and how to safely do it. So I told them they shouldn't do it, but someone else told them a specific place and to bring a parachut. Then they ask another person and they also agree that they shouldn't jump off of a cliff. In that senario another person and me convinced my friend not to jump off of a cliff. I also managed to teach him the lesson on getting advice from multiple people, because the same guy who told him to jump off of a specific place with a parachut fell to his death because the parachut didn't catch the air and tangled.

Another example of taking advice from oher people would be the ,not so great, explorer Christopher Columbus. He took advice from probably over a thousand people not to set sail, because people knew that the earth was infact round and not flat. Everyone knew that the distance from India from Europe was over thousands of miles, but he didn't listen until the king and queen of Spain said okay on the explorers plans. He was a fool who couldn't do correct math and ended up discovering the Bahamas ,and slautered every native on those islands. If he had just listened to the mass of people trying to stop him from sailing he wouldn't have ""discovered"" the Americas and slaughtered over 30 thousand people.

I wanted to write a book about fantasy, but I lacked the creative fuction to put my story on the board. So I contacted my friends and strangers in the streets to ask what I should make my story about. Taking their advice I wrote a million dollar best seller that over took The Hobbit in popularity. All because I asked people what they would've wanted in a fantasy book. The opinions of others might even help me write a book, do something daring, or even just what movie to watch. That is the power of asking others for advice.

Advice can often lead to dangerous situations and even not be that great. That is why I should always ask for a second opinion ,and not just go off and do what one person told me. Weither it be an idea for how to start an essay or even what to eat tonight. Advice can be dangerous, but can be exactly what you wanted to hear or the opposite. The opinion of others can make me do wonders i never thought possible.",0,0.006687353,0,True

TEACHER_NAME,

I take the position on how students should be required to perform community service. The kids say they have better things to do or they have no time, but the obviously have enough time to watch television or go on the internet. So they should be required to do community service. You could require a certain amount of hours per month, year, or even week. This way they know how much time they have to perform so they can make time. Also the community service sounds like it takes a lot of effort, but it really doesn't if you actually do it for a certain amount of time.

Many students have recess or core plus or extra time in their school day because i used to have core plus and it would be useless when there was no activity to do. Well you could give the teachers work or some ideas and have the students do some community service to fill in hours or any another requirement. Putting community service in a students everyday schedule will be adjusted because its another requirement in school that they can achieve. If the students do the service it will pay off in maybe a reward or another prize of some sort. This way students will actually perform the service with more effort. Giving the students requirements will make them participate in community service, and i know that there is at least a half an hour in everybody's day.

Another reason why students should be required to participate in community service is because it makes our community a better place. Maybe picking up trash on the side of the school or roads near the school could help our community. Or helping the disabled students in our school could be counted as community service because it help our society. Taking the time to help other people or our environment or even our school can come in big rewards. To get students started on the job, the service should be required. On small step can lead to big achievements.

My evidence that the face is not really a human being is first of all it doesnt even have a body. Since they took pictures of the face, they could have croped the pictures to look real. In the pictures that scientists took of the face in 1976 to 2001 the pictures look nothing like a face. The pictures show cracks that may appear to look like a face but really isnt.

When a scientist was taking a picture on mars he noticed an enormous head nearly two miles from one end to the other end and it seemed that it was staring back at the cameras from a region of the red planet called cyndonia. The cause of that could have been a shadow and not a human looking back at him. Another thing is that i dont think they seen a Martian because when they said that they had pictures of a Martian, picture cant always be true because of how people crop pictures today.

9C95376E8F12,"If it is Summer break for a student and teachers assign them projects to do over that time, would it be easier and/or more efficient for the student to design their own project or, for the teachers to design it for them ?

Here's why teachers designing the projects for the student makes more sense.

Firstly,due to the fact that if the students are given a teacher designed project they'll most likely have more of an outline of instruction or better direction in which to take it, otherwise the students may not know what to do at all and come up with nothing, The student, if given the chance to design their own may make it too easy for themselves and ultimately learn nothing new over break, Finally the teacher has the opportunity to make something they know the student will be able to understand and manage (as long as they know the student well enough).

Going into more detail with each of these examples now; if the teacher doesn't design a project for the student they may become overwhelmed or confused as stated previously, they could easily lose track of what they're doing because the stress of school holds little weight over them because it is summer and they don't feel the urge to take it as seriously.

However if the teacher does this and makes clear, understandable instructions on what to do and how to do it, the student may feel less overwhelmed or lost, and end up getting it done in a reasonable amount of time and with a good grade as well.

Additionally, if the students make it, they could very well make it TOO easy for themselves without prior outlining of what to do, such as a poster or something of that caliber. All the student needs to do to get it finished is slap a couple pictures on it and write down minimal information about whatever they may be creating that project for. If students were to take such an easy route, the chances of them retaining that information is extremely low.

Finally, the final in depth example on why teachers should make summer projects for their students if their school participates in this rule, Teachers are more than likely reachable over the course of the Summer if the students are still confused as to what they're doing thus making the help of a teacher via email available.

This all isn't to say that there aren't any perks to the students designing these themselves (assuming the student is responsible);

An argument could be brought on to some of these examples saying, maybe if the student doesn't like the project the teacher has created for them, the student could become bored and uninterested, leaving them with a creativity block, that just makes them want to go and do things that their Summer break is for. As well as The student may work more diligently and productively in general if they have creative freedom to do what they want, or can imagine going well with their projects. Third and finally, if the student has no creative freedom they could unintentionally spend more of their break doing something was given to them to do than they had initially thought.

Though there are valid examples for either side to choose from, the side in favor of teachers designing said projects, overall out weighs the other. The percentage of students who can work well from a standard academic point, to the percentage of students who work better at their own pace and creativity level is unequal but, Students with standard learning skills greatly out number the creative working students on average, in most places at least.

Again, teachers provide more help to a greater number of students, They create an outline of instruction, and they keep most students from cheating and making things too easy for themselves.

But what I didn't know that my life would change soon after I graduated. So thanks to my friend Don Reist he invited me ot go to Europe with him on a cattle boat. So of course I couldn't just say no because if I would have to be just carzy It was a life time opportunity.

It was in the year of 1945, it was the time of World War II. So to help people recover, 44 nations joined to form a UNRRA. The UNRRA hired Seagoing Cowboys to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. So the next thing you know Don and I were signed up.

In August 1945, we received our orders to go and report to the New Orleans. "" We arrived August 14 ,"" Luke said. Which was the day the that the Pacific War ended. They got their Seaman's paper and boarded up the SS Charles W. Woodster, headed for Greece with a cargo of 335 horses and plus enough hay to feed them all.

Luke's birthday happened before arriving to Greece. He turned 18 which meant he could be drafted to military service. "" When my draft board learned that I was on a cattle boat trip, they told me to justto keep doing that for my service.""

But the trips we went on were unbelievable opportunities for a little small town boy like me.

It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the Eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. Caring for all the animalsand the crossingskept me busy. They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bag of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. stalls had to be cleaned.

Helping out on my aunt Katie's farm as a little boy helped me a lot to prepare me for this job. But not for the dangers on the seas that I had to face. On my second trip I was watch man for all the crews out on the boats. My job was to check all of the animals for every hour",0,0.008341784,0,True

In this essay I will be covincing you to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. I will talk about how you get to see the world, go site seeing, and get to have fun but also help your country.

First off, seeing the world. in the story I talked about how besides helping people I got to see the breath taking view of Europe and China but seeing the Acropolis in Greece was just beautiful. I also traveled across the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States. Now who wouldn't want to see the world like I did and still help people in need?

Next, site seeing. On my journey to help, I got to take a gondola ( a boat) ride in Venice, Italy a city with sreets of water. Wouldn't it be amazing to go on a gondola and to go explore Italy? Also,I toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. Is'nt that just amazing?

Last but not least, what is a Seagoing Cowboy? I can't persuade you to be one if I don't tell you what it is! A Seagoing Cowboy takes care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas . Don and I signed up. When we were Seagoing Cowboys it was 1945 when World War 2 was over in Europe. We helped countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more. If you like helping people this would be a great job for you.

In conclusion, I hope I convinced you to be a Seagoing Cowboy. Now that I've told you about how you get to see the world, go site seeing, and what a Seagoing Cowboy is I hope I've helped you make up your mind. In the future, I hope more people will sign up and help better our would.",0,0.008449621,0,True
C77A361A7476,"Is it good for students to to finish high school early?. Students should be allowed to take classes early because they do all their work in time , they take classes over the summer or even after school. They also get to go to college faster. They also get to walk and get there diploma faster. The student get's to go to college to study for what he wanted to study for.

The students who study harder or finish the work they do should be allowed to finish school in three years. If they study hard and take extra classes let them fish early. That's all up to them , if they care about their study let them walk early. The student put's his or her mind set to finish school early witch is great for them. The student who finishes school gets more time off of school. But at the same time more stress on them.

At the end of the day the more students that finish school early have one full year of no school. They get to focus on what they wanna go to college for to study. But that's only some schools, some schools don't even allow students to finish school in three years. In some schools they make you do the full 4 years of high school. Some schools probley want the students to do the the full 4 years of high school because they probley need a class on 12th grade.

If some schools let some students finish in the 3 years then the school wont be as packed. The schools need more space cause of more students coming in. They need to have more space and it would be less work for them. But at the same time it would take some time off the teachers. Some teachers have the time to help students and some don't.

Welp that's all have to say about schools letting students finish school in three years. I really think schools should let students finish early because they work hard to get there.

If the student finishes his or her work they should be allowed to walk early. I think that all schools should allow all the students who want to finish early to let them. It's good for the student that means he or her is educated and can get a good job and go to college to study for something really good.",0,0.0070267143,0,True

5F3F027AABDA,"During summer break, many teachers will assign a project that is designed to give students the freedom to work at their own pace and fully discover and interesting topic. When this project is designed too specifically by the teacher, however, many students become disinterested and only do the bare minimum of work. In order to keep students motivated, and make the project beneficial in their future lives, students should be allowed to design their own project for the summer. Student-designed summer projects motivate pupils to create higher quality products, solve diverse real-world problems, and develop unique skill sets that cannot be learned inside the classroom.

On the other hand, there are many who support the use of teacher-designed summer projects, because they are more related to the subjects taught in school and thus more useful in furthering students' education. Opponents cite several studies that show students forget nearly ten percent of what they learn in school over summer break. With a teacher-led project during the break, students will be encouraged to remember and use what they have learned in school instead of letting months of hard work in school go to waste. While it is true that students will learn more of the curriculum through a teacher-designed project, a better use of the time during summer is to teach subjects not covered in the curriculum. Topics that are specific to certain career fields can only be learned through independent study, and student-led summer projects are the most effective way to encourage this kind of study.

When students are given the freedom to choose a project that plays to their interests and learning style, instead of being forced to do a certain project by their teachers, the quality of the students' projects improves dramatically. One way that this freedom encourages a higher quality project is by increasing student engagement. Modern psychological studies have shown that students are less driven to succeed at a task if they feel they are being forced to accomplish it. Students allowed to choose their own summer project would not feel forced into a specific course of action, increasing their engagement in the assignment and thus the overall quality of their final project. Designing their own project also creates a higher-quality product by adapting it to their own learning styles. Psychologists working in the field of memory have found that students often learn best in one of four learning styles: Reading/Writing, Auditory, Visual, or Kinesthetic. With the ability to adapt the requirements of the assignment to their learning styles, students would create a higher-quality product with much less unnecessary effort. Because of this increase in quality, student-designed projects are also very effective at solving real-world problems.

Projects that have been chosen and designed by students create solutions to real-world problems in ways that teacher-led ones cannot. By deciding on their own projects, students can pursue interests that lie outside of the usual subjects found in school. Summer projects designed by teachers usually focus on one of the few categories of science, english, or mathematics that schools teach. Students who are provided the opportunity to design a project on their own will be able to pursue fields of study that are not touched on by schools, gaining knowledge in many other diverse areas of study. In addition, the ability to choose their own projects allow students to tackle problems that face our world today with their own unique solutions. As one example of this, a team of students who chose their own project for science class was able to create groundbreaking new technology for removing floating debris from the ocean, which has the potential to improve the lives of billions of people who depend on the health of the ocean to survive. If more students could pursue their interests in the same way that this team did, many new solutions to today's problems would emerge. In addition, students who pursue their own interests in this way are also much more prepared for their chosen careers in the future.

Student-designed projects develop unique skills in students that are not learned through teacher-led study. One skill that independent projects teach is the ability to do creative, independent work. As adults, many find that leadership positions in the workplace require some degree of creativity, and tasks must often be completed with little input from those higher in the chain of authority. By allowing students to produce their own ideas and work on their own schedule, rather than assigning students ideas and schedules, student-led projects encourage the traits that are necessary for any productive member of society. In giving students the independence to try out their own ideas, these projects also allow students to learn skills that are not covered by the main subjects of traditional schooling. For example, a student interested in becoming a veterinarian would not learn very much about his or her desired career through the core classes, but would learn a great deal through a project requiring him or her to study animals. Student-designed projects, therefore, are much more effective than teacher-designed ones when it comes to preparing students for their future professions, and for their future lives as a whole.

When students are presented the opportunity to design their own summer projects, they become motivated to improve the quality of their work, make a lasting impact on the real world, and develop unique skills that can aid them in future careers. When students are given the freedom to choose who they want to be early on in their lives, they become better equipped in the future to make their dreams a reality. In order to produce students who are skilled, effective, and motivated to succeed, teachers should allow their students to choose what subjects they would like to explore during the summer.",0,0.35519436,0,True
1B069ADEF513,"The student council is holding a meeting at the cafeteria while the school basketball team is practicing for their upcoming game. These things are called extracurricular activities. The principle has decided these things are mandatory. I think students shouldn't have to participate in extracurricular activities because students schedules and students being forced to do something they dont want to do.

Lots of students have busy lives. Students and their parents could have something planned or reserved for a certain time.( going to parties, a get together, vacations/trips, shopping etc.) The activity and plan might collide, which probably would cause rescheduling and chaos. Students could also already have an activity outside of school. How I see it in my mind is that if someone already takes a sport (outside of school) and now has to take another activity in school. They would have less time, less motivation, and more work. Our four core classes and two electives already give us plenty of homework to do. Doing an activity will require more effort and less time to do the homework from our classes. Whether it be a writing assignment for the student council, doing work for the yearbook club or practicing for a sport.

Students may feel forced to do an activity they dont like. For some kids their might not be an activity they enjoy and then proceed to pick one they dont like. Doing this could make them resent school or feel some type of sadness. Their also could be a large demand for one activity a student has applied for. After applying the student learns hes been excluded because of maximum limit of people in one club. The student is now in a club he doesn't enjoy. If I was in the student shoes i would feel like the school has been unfair or betrayed me. Being forced to do something is almost never a good thing. especially if you don't enjoy it. Forcing anyone to do something they don't want to do could cause a state of depression, anxiety or a fear of it.

However, participating in extracurricular activities would mean less screen time. Students can socialize and plus most teenagers are addicted to their phones and its not healthy for them at all. Doing activities will decrease the time by a good percentage. Being addicted to anything is definitely not healthy but, being forced to do something isnt either. In my opinion more screen time is better than doing something you resent because you are enjoying it and you are also technically socializing by messaging or calls. All in all lots of screen time may not be healthy, but its better than participating in activity you dont like.

In conclusion it shouldn't be mandatory to be in an extracurricular activity because of the schedules of students and being forced to do something you dont want to do. Activities will interfere with these things causing chaos and even resenting school. This is my honest opinion on this decision. If you take the time to think about this decision, you'll realize whos going to be effected and how they are going to be effected. This is why I disagree about having to participate in extracurricular activities.",0,0.0070177834,0,True

We now have entire sports dedicated to cars and motorcycles, cars powered by alternate energy sources, and many other novel concepts that have taken the world by storm. However, there are many potential advantages of limiting your use of our precious automobiles.

One of the first reasons that you should reduce your usage of cars is found all around us, in the environment. Some statistics of the current amount of damage we cause by using our cars like we do include that fact that passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to fifty percent in some areas of the United States. Imagine if we could reduce those numbers? David Goldberg, and official of Transportation for America a fastgrowing coalition of hundreds of groups in the United states, said ""How much you drive is as important as whether you drive a hybrid."" There are some places that are taking this concept to heart. One example of this is in Bogota, Columbia, where on certain days every year, a Day Without Cars in the capital city leaves only buses and taxis with permission to be on the roads. Despite the rain on the third time the event took place, the turnout was still great. There were even other cities, Cali and Valledupar, that took part in the fun. Municipal authorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic about what they saw. The country of Colombia has made a conscious effort to reduce their carbon footprint since the mid1990s. Bogota has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths as well as parks and sports centers have also cropped up. This also in turn resulted in an improved economy as new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. The current President of the United States, Barack Obama, has also recently unveiled ambitious goals to curb the US's greenhouse gas emmisions. Wouldn't it be great if we could all help the environment out by reducing our usage of cars?

How great would it be, if at the same time as leanding the earth a helping hand, you were able to improve your own happiness? In Vauban, Germany and several other places globally, this has already begun to take effect. The people of this city are part of the ""Smart Planning"" movement. This experimental community on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders, is taking reducing automobile usage to a whole new level. Seventy percent of Vauban's families simply do not own a car. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and a mother of two living in Vauban, said ""When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" as she walked the verdant streetes where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering people drown out an occasional distant motor. The ""Smart Planning"" movement isn't just restricted to this place though. It is merely an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States, and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use. In Bogota, businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza said as he rode a twoseat bicycle with his wife, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" on a Day Without Cars. Some may still say though, ""How if by giving up my car, will I be happier? I will have to find some other transportation mean and potentially have to wake up much earlier than I already to get everywhere. That seems more stressful to me."" However, due to the recession in the US, many people are having to do adapt this type of lifestyle out of necessity. Many can't afford new vechiles but still must get to work somehow. Even after the recession ends, many sociologists believe that many will not return their previous way of life.

Finally, there are already many plans in place to reduce automobile usage. At the Mobile World Congress in 2012 in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan that shows how impractical or undesireable it will be for many to own a vehicle. He also proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create ciries in which ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, and improve safety."" The Environment Protection Agency as well as legislators are promoting the reduced use of personal vehicles by working to induct a new sixyear federal transportation bill, rather than previous ones that have devoted about eighty percent of the appropriations have gone to highway improvements and the remaining twenty percent to other transport.

To wrap everything up, there are many reasons that everyone should try to reduce automobile use. For one, it will help the environment, it will increase general happiness, and finally, that there are plans that are already in place to make it more feasable for people to adopt this new lifestyle. Whether we will see a drastic change or not, we will not know until we try. But that all starts, with you.",0,0.015531794,0,True

I think that there is no proof that aliens made it because even NASA said that is was just, ""A huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth,"" I believe that this quote means that not even NASA thinks that the Face was formed by aliens they just believe that it was just shadows on the rock. Another example from the text that makes me believe that it wasn't made by aliens is that, ""People think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists.

In the articles ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer and ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner, both articles argue on the subject of if the Electoral College should be kept or if the election should be changed to popular vote.

Although it is true, according to the article by Richard A. Posner, that larger states get the majority of attention when it comes to votes, it is still possible that regardless that the legislatures choose the electors, the electors may ""defy the will of the people"", according to the article by Bradford Plumer. It is stated that electors have declined the voting of their party's candidate and went on to ""vote for whomever they please...."" Furthermore, in the article by Bradford Plumer, Plumer states, ""the electoral college is unfair to voters."" In other words, the popular vote basically gets no say in who they are choosing for presidential candidate, only who gets to choose the candidate. Even as stated in the opposing article by Richard A. Posner, Posner states, ""the electoral will not win the national popular vote."" This is stating that basically the popular vote is powerless in voting for a presidential candidate.

Moreover, Posner explains in his article, ""The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast."" However this has happened before where there has been more of a ""tie,"" Plumer backs this up quoting that ""In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president.""

AF4152FBC8DA,"Many schools require their students to complete summer projects, but are they given the freedom of making their own product? Some students would prefer to have their teacher assign them a certain project because they struggle to find something that interests them. However, most students prefer to come up with their own idea. Summer projects should be student-designed because it helps develop their work ethic, students can not copy off of other projects, and the final product will be more polished.

Allowing students to design their own type of project would make them more interested in it, and help develop their work ethic. Everyone is interested in different subjects, and not everyone thinks the same way. Giving students the freedom of working on a project in which they find interesting will greatly increase their work ethic. It is crucial that students are developing their minds all year round. When students return to school, they feel like it is their first day of school in their lives. Providing students with the option of working on a project which interests them will make them more prepared for the start of the shcool year. The best students have a great work ethic. They are able to do alot of work for a long time. The more interested a student is in their work, the more they will want to do it.

When teachers assign students work, it is very easy for them to copy ideas. Teachers will assign the same work to all their students, and the students will not do thier own work. When students copy off of other people, they are not gaining any skills, nor learning how to be independent. Allowing students to create their own projects will enhance their creativity, and encourage them to think outside the box. The purpose of school is help young kids find what interests them. No one wants to do something that does not interest them. Therefore, students will not do their own work. Students will do their own work if they are interested in the subject, and allowing them to create their own product is how to accomplish this..

Lastly, allowing students to design their own project will provide a better, more polished final product. It is very easy to create a project on something if the individual is familiar with the idea. The more interested someone is in a certain subject, the better the product will be. For example, it is difficult to write an essay on something that is unfamiliar, or not interesting. On the contrary, it is easy for an individual to write an essay on something that interestes them, or they know alot about. This idea can apply to almost anything, especially a school project. It is hard to find the drive to do schoolwork over summer, but it helps if students are allowed to choose their own assignment, and if students want to work on the project, their final product will be better.

Their are many benefits to allowing students to create their own projects. Their product will be better, they will do it themselves, and it helps develop their work ethic. Finding ways to encourage students to complete their summer work can be challenging, but giving them the freedom of doing something they find interesting is the best way to create an incentive.

7D5D980FD05F,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. This allows students to learn in the comfort of their own home, without having to transport to a private, or public school. This may be convienent for parents who work on a busy schedule, allowing them to choose when and where they want their chilldren to learn.

Although online schooling my be beneficial to some children, it may harm their future.

With this being said, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because they wouldn't develop social skills, they would have a hard time creating relationships with others, and they may struggle from lack of motivation and depression.

To grow as an individual, it is essential to surround oneself with others. This is because it allows individuals to develop skills that may make or break their future. These skills are called social skills, and they should be developed as a child. Social skills are important for student development because it allows them to communicate with the people surrounding them on an every day basis. Schools were intended to bring students together, allowing communication with one another, which is why it is so important for students to learn in grow in schools that are not online. Social skills may also be one of the biggest things a student can learn in school, and this is something that online schooling does not offer. Communicating with one another will allow students to work and learn together, creating relationships on the way. If students are not surrounded by others, they will have a difficult time creating relationships and friendships with others.

Relationships play a huge role in almost everyone's life. Whether their romantic, family oriented, or friendships, they are an important way to grow as an individual. Students who attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing may find it difficult to create relationships that are not family oriented because they are not surrounded by other students every day. While students who attend online school are in the comfort of their own home, students that attend schools outside of their home are comforted by the people surrounding them. This is why students who attend school outside of their home have a major advantage, which is developing relationships. Students will also get a sense of who they are and what they like when engaging and developing relationships with other students, which students who take school online will not be able to do. Most students find joy in creating relationships with others, so they are excited to wake up every morning for school. Those who aren't able to create bonds with others may lack that motivation to get up every morning, which may take a toll on their mental health.

Students who attend school beyond the comfort of their own household may have more motivation to get out of bed every morning than those who take school online. This is because the students who are enrolled in schools may look forward to getting out of the house and seeing their friends every morning, while the students who are enrolled in online schooling have to stay in, isolated from things beyond their household. This may cause harm on the mental health of the students taking school online because they may feel excluded from the world around them. Feeling excluded from the world around them may place a sense of loneless in their life, which may lead to depression. Students should be surrounded by others as they grow so they can maintain a healthy mental state, and be happy.

Critics may argue that online schooling has a positive impact on students because if they learn in an enviorment that they feel most comfortable in, then they will be able to absorb more information on a daily basis. They may also say that it is more managable for busy students, and that they can work their schedules around education. However, students who learn at home all their life will suffer from a lack social skills, and will have a hard time fitting in in the real world. This will cause them to have a major disadvantage from the students because they will have a difficlut time communicating with the people around them, which will definately have an impact on their future. Students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because they wouldn't develop social skills, they would have a hard time creating relationships with others, and they may struggle from lack of motivation and depression.",0,0.17603113,0,True
2766580B8D9A,"This Facial Action Coding System could be good in a couple ways but its unnecessary. Computers might know what your emotions and help in a couple ways to know if you're confused about something or do not like something you see on the internet. Just because you look at someones face, it doesn't mean that they feel some type of way. Someone could be smiling or laughing but that doesn't mean that they are truely happy. It's the same thing by having a serious face.

A face expression doesn't always show someone's emotions. Other people do not care about other people's emotions. It's better to notice things with your own eyes than a computer or machine to tell you how somebody is ""feeling"". The article says you can tell how a friend is feeling by just looking at their face. That's true because you know that person very well.

0EBA0162ABBB,"Do you ever have things to do after school that you absolutely have to do no matter what? Well I do sometimes and I would hate it if I missed out on some of the plans I make during the week. Some of the plans are more serious than others but that really doesnt matter. I disagree with having to participate in after school activities because kids have stuff to do after school, some kids just don't want to stay at school any longer, and some parents might not like that their kid has to stay after school.

One reason is that kids have stuff to do after school. They might have sports that they need to practice for like football, basketball, and soccer. Kids have to go grocery shopping with their parents so they can get what they need at home. Parents also might have family activities planned that they really want their kid to go to. For example my family likes to take me out to eat after school sometimes.

Another reason is that a lot of kids might not want to participate. Kids like to just go home after a long day of school because they might be hungry or it might be something like a headache. Also students might not like he activities that the school makes you go to. For example, they might like helping their favorite teacher clean up or plan for their next day after school. And they might feel that instead of helping out for a year book it should extra math work, language arts work, or science work.

Parents possibly being mad at the school is another reason. Parents might want their kid home for reasons like chores, so kids can help parents, and parents just want their kid at home with them. Another big thing is that parents might not be able to give a ride if the school doesnt provide an after school bus. For example, whenever I stay after school I ride the activity bus but some days shelburne doesnt have an activity bus. Parents also might not be ok with the school making kids stay after and they might complain a lot to the principal.

In conclusion students should not have to participate in extra curricular activities because kids want to go home, they have other things to do at home, and parents might not be happy with their kid having to stay after school without a choice. Kids do a lot of things after school and having to stay after school would ruin some of the things they do. For example, kids like me like to go home and play video games and I really would not like it if we had to stay after school. And my parents would also be mad because they want me to come home instead of staying after school so I can help them with things they need.",0,0.006748945,0,True

In congress to make the vote go though.

Under the 23rd Amendment of the constitution, the District of Columbia is allocate  3 electors. They are treated like they are a state that is in the united states, But most people just call them District of columbia.

Each state has a candidate that running for president in there state. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but there a lot of states that are not like that and the vote on who they believe in. Who they think that is going to do the best job as president.

The president election is held every four years. no president can be president more then twice, but there was one person had more then two but that was a thing that happend because there was a war going on.

BF5D1465DFFC,"I agree what Duke Ellington's said because sports, school, and family there is always a problem and a chance for you to do your best. Sports is what most of people do play a sport but we always get frustrated when the opposite team scores a point so we try our hardest to score back the point. School is what a lot of humans struggle on its our work sheets and test but every question wrong we get it makes our brain smarter so do our best and not pick the wrong answer. Family is people we love and hang out with all the time but not very often we get into problems but every time we have a problem we just have to find a solution to do our best. This is why I agree what Duke Ellington said about a problem is a chance to do your best.

Sports is fun activity we can all do but most of the people do or watch but a lot of the player or fans. Start to become angry because their opponent scored a point but. The players can solve the problem and do their best to try to get the point back. When I was ten years old i played on a soccer league my team was losing to our rivals our coach told us the problem why they keep scoring on us. The team and I fixed the problem an tried our best trying to win back again and we did win. My brother plays basketball he used to be terrible at playing basketball he missed every shot but fixed the problem by practing more and tried his best. Most of the sports have a problem but they fix it.

School is a place where we make friend learn new subjects. For some people in school they struggle a lot on worksheets, test and quizzes. I used to struggle on test and quizzes but when i got the test or quiz back i studied on the questions i got wrong. So when next time I took the test i would get those questions right. So the problem i got wrong i tried my best to remember it so i would not forget it when i have the same questions on the test

Family are people we love and hang out with but sometimes we have problems with each other. When problems happen we try to fix our way and try our best to not have problems anymore. When I was younger I never wanted to share with my siblings. But i had to fix the problem and try my best to share with my siblings. My older brother dislike me to use his video game so my parents help fix his problem with me and my brother sharing.

This is the essay about how Duke Ellington saying help a lot of people to fix their problem. All of my problems were fixed so it my help people fix their problems to fix them. The problem to people is that they dont know how to fix there problems and that is why a lot of people struggle on that.

0C5456B41BD0,"As a student, the summer projects should be teacher-designed projects. Summer projects should be teacher-designed projects due to the fact that teachers know what the students need to learn in the next grade. For an example, in first grade you learn how to add and subtract using double digit number, if the teachers designs the project for the summer you will have more knowledge about adding and subtracting. Also, teachers know the material to help you succeed in school. Not to mention that if the student designs it how would students gain knowledge of it? As students, they would rather have easier homework and easier projects rather than homework and projects the will benefit you. Lastly, teachers know what is needed to know in the upcoming grade; So the teacher-designed can help them prepare for the next grade.

Student based projects are not a good idea for several different reasons. The student-designed projects are not beneficial to students due to the fact that students don't know what is going to be learned in the next grade level, so how they going to know how their own project is going to benefit themselves? As for teachers, they are going to know what is coming up in the upcoming grade. Another reason is due to the fact that students are going to do a easy projects. Not all easy projects benefit you to have more knowledge, therefore teachers design the projects so that students could gain more knowledge off the project. Lastly, the teacher-design project is going to prepare you for the next grade, so you will be more advanced with subject when you get in the class next year.

To sum up, Teacher-design summer project benefit you in many different ways. It can benefit you by working to learn upcoming material. Teacher-design projects also benefits you by teachers knowing what is needed to know in the next grade. Finally, it benefits you because teachers know what is coming up in the upcoming grade level, so it helps you prepare for the next grade level. Student-designed can also benefit you in gaining knowledge, but not as much knowledge from teachers-designed projects.",0,0.0069354586,0,True
9608614D166E,"About a month ago, I had a chat with my friend during play rehearsal about her distance learning. She had been absent from classes since first quarter, but would show up for almost every rehearsal; after I was certain it wasn't my imagination, I decided to confront her about it: ""Where have you been?"" I asked, ""I noticed you haven't been in Musical Theatre class, but you still show up here. Is something wrong?"" She laughed and told me that nothing was wrong, and she was just distance learning. Her response prompted me to ask her several questions about how that would work. Admittedly, I was a bit skeptical of it at first, but I quickly learned that learning from home has its benefits! Many students would benefit from distance learning.

In my little interview with my friend, I learned why she personally began attending classes from home: near the beginning of the school year, she became very overwhelmed by the workload it brought and began having severe panic attacks, sending her into a downward spiral that prevented her from getting her schoolwork done. Fortunately, school administrators recognized this and recommended she try distance learning. She was glad they did, because up to the day of our conversation, she had been learning from home ever since, only going to school occasionally to take tests or submit projects that couldn't be submitted online. She told me that she benefited from taking most of her classes at home, because she didn't have to face the pressure of keeping up with her classmates, for she could just learn at her own pace. This allowed her to focus on her work and enjoy coming to school for rehearsal; she and school administrators expected that by April, she wouldn't need to stay at home anymore.

Something she told me that really amazed me was the fact that my friend was doing great in Musical Theatre. I didn't think distance learning would be beneficial for the class, because most of it is performances and workshops, where students learn ensemble numbers, workshop each other's audition pieces, and perform those auditions in front of the class. The fact that my friend was taking Musical Theatre from home goes to show that, even for a class so dependent on the presence of other people, students can still perform well while learning a majority of the curriculum in someplace other than a classroom (or, in the case of a Musical Theatre class, a black box).

My friend helped me realize that distance learning is more useful than it may seem. For example, even if it is helpful to be taught by a teacher in-person, I may find it difficult to keep up with lectures or notes, because of distracting friends, cold classrooms, and the inability to go to the bathroom whenever I want. Sometimes I need more time to process the topic for the day, or I may need to relearn the material in a room where I can adjust the thermostat. These are all benefits of learning at home!

People who don't have an official distance learning plan administrated to them still take advantage of the good work that comes from learning outside of the classroom. Chances are -- you already do that, whenever you spend your time at home to review your notes again, ask your sibling for clarification, or watch some educational videos on YouTube. Distance learning, officially administrated plan or not, helps students like you, me, and my friend learn at their own paces and from the comfort of their homes.",0,0.9888031,1,False
1F18B1FA090B,"Fellow citizens, I would like to talk about the advantages to the incipient idea of limited car usage. Limited car usage is the limitation of cars used in a certain area, however, the limitations all depends on the area. Some places in the world completely ban cars, in which you would need to pay a fine in order to even keep your car, much less drive it. Other places simply have limitations on a particular day(s), in whish on those days if you drive a car you may or may not be fined. The main advantage of limited car usage, is that it can reduce pollution in an area. Also limited car usage, although not obvious, can also help reduce car crashes.

If there is one major problem in the world that has yet to be solved, it is the amount of pollution, smog, and greenhouse gases that has accumilated throughout the Earth; limited car usage, however, can help reduce that problem. According to Robert Duffer, Paris enforced a partial driving ban when days of near-record pollution occured. ""[Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found.....The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday"" (Duffer). Also in Bogota, Colombia, they have car-free days which help reduce air pollution. ""'

It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution ,' said buisinessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife."" (Selsky). Also, citizins of limited car usage areas do not seem to mind and even enjoy not having a car, for example Heidrun Walter from Vauban, Germany, states ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" (Rosenthal). As shown by evidence, citizens agree that limited car usage not only helps the place's overall environment but also the Earth's environment, and some citizens of limited car usage areas do not even seem to mind it.

In addition, limited car usage can also reduce fatal car crashes. Although this second advantage is not as major as the first, in some perspectives, it is still important. Limited car usage seems to be linked to less people driving, as  I infered by this evidence ""There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license.....A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009"" (Rosenthal). With less people driving less fatal car crashes are bound to happen due to the fact that less people are driving. Although I may not be right, I feel as though two or more people bumping into each other while walking is not nearly as fatal as two or more cars 'bumping' into each other.

In total, although limited car usage may not seem to have many advantages, the few that it does have are detramental. Limited car usage has the advantages of not only helping the environment, but also helping or maybe even saving citizens from fatal car crashes throughout the world.    ",0,0.0073427116,0,True
1e9afe51,"Dear Senator, Good day, I am writing this letter to let you know it's time for things to change. I have been reading and researching the Electoral College and i have a strong opinion on it. As you know, the Electoral College is a process when all five hundred and thirty eight electors vote on electors and defenders. This way of voting for electors lets the people have no say in whose running our government! Our government should not allow or be based on ""the winner takes all"" method. When we choose for OUR president we should be able to choose OUR electors too! Under the 23rd amendment of the constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the electoral college. The electors shouldnt be chosen by the candidate's political party, we should choose. By voting for a president every four years a new party of electors have already been selected to run with him and we dont get any say. After the presidential election, your governor creates a list of all the candidates that ran for president in your state with a list of their representative electors. This is later sent to Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.

Richard Nixon, Bob Dole, Jimmy Carter, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFLCIO all agree that we need to remove and forget about the electoral college. This year our voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could lose the presidency. Still the electoral college still has defenders fror themselves is crazy. Facts say voters arent actually voting for the president, but for a group of electors who in turn elect the president, and that is ridiculous. How are we supposed to trust these electors if we dont even know who they are and their background until after the election? Who even are these electors i wondered. I figured out that all the electors are actually anyone with a brain and not holding a public office, fantastic. So how do i know they are reliable and going to do whats best for my state and our country? Voters dont even control whom their electors vote for most of the time which is kind of scary. Some electors are even faithless in their party's candidate so they dont even vote for them at all! How can we rely on a group of people who dont rely on their party?

As much as I hate to say it, there most definitley is an upside to the Electoral College. The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a nondemocratic method of selecting a president that needs to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. I personally think that is the best way to decide who gets in. Each party selects a slate of electors that are trusted to vote for the party's nominee. Sometimes the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Another reason The Electoral College is a positive way of voting is how certain the outcome is. There is never failure in the counting of the votes and there us rarely a tie between two people. My favorite reason is because ""everybody is president"". This means everybody can make their own decisions and have a great amount of freedom.

Even though im all for removing the Electoral College there is positives too. In a few years when i am able to vote, i will be careful of who I vote for and make sure that there is great electors in the party i vote for.",0,0.0069678864,0,True
7999A063F80E,"I agree that praising a students work is an outstanding idea to jump start a students path to success,but praise is not the way to increase their self-esteem. By overpraising a student his or her confidence has to be on a different level. Students will also have a harder time dealing with constructive criticism. However, if a student works really hard to achieve something,then that feeling of completion can motivate them to continue to their path of success. Getting your business done without any praising and knowing you put your all into it could make you feel way better about yourself and it would just not motivate you but the people around you. I say this because people don't usually thank you or give you any comments they usually mean. You would never know what could come out someone's mouth.

They wouldn't want to agree with this but, that's because we all think different and most of us know the real meaning behind something similar to this. If you achieve something and you keep on achieving things in life you will get many blessings. People don't usually know the difference between praising and achieving your goal without it. You don't need people telling you about your work or whatever you are doing because at the end of the day you're the only one who knows what you're accomplishing in life. Teachers should let students achieve their goals and not worry about what the other person has to do or say. By accomplishing something could make you learn new things in life too. People get confused and don't get the message, we need more people to believe in their selves and not about what other people have to say.

Although I think it's nice of people complimenting and saying positive things about your work but, I still have to go with achieving it on your own. So what if they dislike your achievements? so what if they start doubting? prove them wrong with all your accomplishments that are coming your way.

391757E8299B,"Statistics have shown that 82% of students, that do extracurricular activities, get better grades and perform better in school. Many schools offer extracurricular activities for their students. There are many different activities that schools offer, that various of students do. They can range from sports, clubs, and etc. Having extracurricular activities required for students is a good idea because it helps with focus, productivity, and learning.

Doing extracurricular activities can keep students focused on school work and on other things. Doing what you are passionate about, for example, music can help you stay focused. After a long day of school, it can be refreshing to just play your instrument or play a game of soccer. Some students might want to do extracurricular activities to be in a better environment, and doing can help. Something could be happening at home or just something that is bothering them, the activities can help take their mind off of it. There are also have clubs that help with homework, which can lower your stress and keep you focused. Getting your homework completed and getting helped by a teacher can help you feel stressed and unfocused at times, so having extracurricular activities can help with that issue.

Doing dances, sports, or maybe a club can be very productive for pupils. Say you have a new years resolution/goal and it's to play a sport or get active. Playing on your school's football team is a great start to a productive year. Homework clubs are also a good place to go, if you want to be productive. You'll be able to finish your homework and projects that you have, without procrastination involved. Staying at school, doing a club can be way more productive then staying home. When you stay home you are more likely to get lazy and get off task but at school you won't have the same resources, to get lazy, for example, a phone or a TV. Being productive is very important, and staying after school can have a big part in it.

Some people think that doing extracurricular activities waste your time and you learn less. However it's the complete opposite, you can learn so much and things you can't learn during school hours. If a student wanted to be a photographer, they could go to photography class. Many students stay after to learn something new and exciting. Schools that also offer clubs to help with homework and classwork can actually help them to learn more in that class. It can teach students topics, they didn't get before. And lastly, you can learn to play a sport. Sports are amazing to learn and once you get good at it, it is extremely fun. Learning new things are super important, without extracurricular activities it would be harder for students to learn topics like sports, dances, and etc.

Our principle has decided that each student at our school need to do at least one extracurricular activity. It will help the students in various of ways, for example, to focus, to be productive, and to learn new things, they may or may not have know. Some good activities that you can take part in is the sports team or the step team, there are lots of things offered after school, that everyone should do!",0,0.009304156,0,True

He has good evidence and shows that he really did look into it and did his research before saying his suggestion. He had more then enough reasons to support his claim.

In the text it states ""The planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees fehrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth."" This shows that Venus is very hot and could be danger to us if we don't look into it and care about it. This shows that if you don't look into Venus you'd never know about the changes it could be making to our world.

Although that is very interesting the author add more reasons on to why you should study Venus. In the passage it states that "" Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun.""

This shows that if something were to go wrong it would also effect us on Earth because of how close it is and how hot Venus is. This really supports his idea because it lets us know how hard it must be to do any type of research on Venus but we should still try.

Since Venus is very hot and is set at a tempature we've never felt before here on Earth it could be hard to study Venus in real life. In the text it states that ""Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks."" This is good evidence the author uses because it lets us get an idea of how hard it must be to do reseach and that we should take advantage of the information we have now and study Venus with that.

In conclusion the author had really good points and good evidence to support his claim about us studying Venus. It really proves that Venus can be dangerous and that we should be prepared and know our information if something were to happen.

F7BF9754D944,"To start off I see electorcal college as a bad thing... Not for one reason For many reasons but the main one is that its unfair to voters because of the winner-take-all-system in each state. Anther Reason is because canidates dont spend time in the states they know they have no chance of winning. Abd there only fucosing only on tight races in the ""siwng"" states.

And plus its unfair, outdated, and last irrational...

Reason i say that is because it doesnt give no chance for us to find our right leader and to me you need to be fair with your voters and need to have the right president for your country. So he could do smart decisions for your people and state... And plus i disagree wuth this system because am in the democratic side of the hole system. And the Electorcal College is not democratic method of selecting a president that ought be overuled... In otherwords it is the electors that choose the president not the people. And to me theres no point of voting because if you cant oick what you want then whats the point of even trying to vote.

And your not voting for president your voting for the state of electors so they could choose the president for you... But the only thing positive thing that i see that each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the partys nominee. But there are many rataining things about the Electrol College that you may not or may know about but i think i need to tell you... Its a lack of democratic pedigree, all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons. What am trying to say with this hole thing its that it doesnt fucos on the people as much as it should.

And the Electorcal College method of selecting the president may turn off alot of voters that are intrested in voting or taking place in our country, or just has no hope of carrying there state. For example Demorcrats in Texas, or Republicans in California. There votes will not be effected. Reason being because they have less incentive to pay attention to the compaign than most of them would have if the president were picked by the popular vote... But lets face it non voters swings in a national election, and in spite pf that, about one-half of the American population did vote in 2012 election. So if you think about it, it was only succesful during 2012 or maybe a little before that...

And another negative thing about the Electoral College with the Big states that might really get your attention is that the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance so that means large states have lose by the virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decrease in the Constition.. For example the popular vote in Florida was very close.  Obama who won that vote got 29 electoral votes. So that means a victory for him... But the one good thing about it is that the larger states get more attention then the smaller states do.

Well to end this letter I want to say i disagree with keeping Electoral College and those were the reasons...

Being a sea cowboy is alot of fun.

I mean if you love animals especally horses than this is the job for you. You get to be with horses and feed them. Horses are vert nice and big cuddly animals. If you are an animal lover especally a horse lover and a cattle lover than you should enroll. If you lived on a farm or worked in one and found it somewhat fun taking care of horses than this is the job for you .

If you enroll you can also be all around the world like the first time I went I went to Europe and even China after some time. If you like traviling than this is the job for you. If you like being on a boat than this is the perfect job foe you. If you like being on a boat and love animals especially horses and sea animals than this is a good place for you becuse you might even get to see some dolphins and other sea animals. And if you get bored of looking at the water or searching for sea animals don't worry you still have horses and cows.

Once you unload the animals you can still stay active even if you dont have to clean the stalls or bruch them. For instance on my way back i got to play volleyball and baseball. We would play games and everything.

This is NOT a boring job. For instance you get to be in the outdoors or indoors, you get to be with animal, and you also can be looking out in the sea.

This even counts as a military service like for me it also did. After i enrolled they told me that I could stay there and it would count as my service.

So like i said before this is NOT a boring job, you get to be with animals, it is very fun, you get to be all around the world, you can stay active even after you unload the animals, you get to play games, and it counts as your military service. So if you find your self liking this job than you should enroll.                             ",0,0.006607507,0,True
40331978F344,"When creating movies, games, or any other art, its a good idea to get advice from others instead of just one person, first off, its a good strategy to make your work more diverse, makes it more appealing, and more opinions is better than one.

First off, when creating art, its important to get advice from others, but the more you get, the more clearer and more diverse it becomes. They can tell you if you messed up and why. They can give you ideas to make characters to fill in the gaps, They can also help expand the story.

Second off, If you want to seem as appealing as possible, you should ask people for what they want and work with them. If you want your work to succeed you must work with others so you both get what you want. appealing to peoples opinions also helps your work by showing that you care. everyone has different opinions, one person might like one thing while everyone else hates it. appeal to the bigger opinion.

Lastly, the more opinions you have, the more messages your art will have. One person isnt enough to give enough opinions. instead of just one opinion, you should have multible opinions so you can give your art a message. listening and getting feedback from multible sources will help you and your art in conclusion, three good reasons why to get multible opinions is; making it more appealing to a general audience, fill in gaps, and get feedback.",0,0.00750577,0,True
62f4c5fb,"Today, automobiles are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some areas of the United States. To lower this statistic, many cities around the world are trying to cut down on car use in order to curb their greenhouse gas emissions. Cities like Vauban, Germany, Paris, France, and Bogota, Colombia have their own strategies for the reduction of these emissions from cars. These cities are having extraordinary success and many Americans are limiting their car usage as well.

In Vauban, Germany, many residents have given up their cars. This is due to the strict rules and limitations for car ownership in this experimental new district. If one would like to own a car, large garages that cost 40,000, along with a home must be bought. This has made many residents completely give up the use of cars and rely on public transportation and bicycles. In the article, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, one resident stated,""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Residents are embracing this new and innovative lifestyle and as a result, the greenhouse gas emissions from this area in Germany has decreased exponentially. The location of stores and businesses has also changed due to the very few who use automobiles. In the article, it is revealed, ""In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway."" Even with these limitations, residents are not complaining and as a result, new suburbs around the world may start to look and be like Vauban, Germany.

Many cities around the world are being forced to issue partial driving bans in order to clear the air of the city. In the article, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", by Robert Duffer, it is explained how and why the city of Paris was forced to issue partial driving bans due to the very high levels of smog. Duffer writes, ""On Monday, motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine 31. The same would apply to oddnumbered plates the following day."" Due to this partial ban, congestion was down 60 percent and 4,000 drivers were fined. These fined drivers paid, in total, around 88,0000euro124,000. Not only did the pollution decrease dramatically but this money went back to the government. The article then reveals, ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for oddnumbered plates on Tuesday."" After just one day, the results that was wanted by the city of Paris were achieved. This is absolutely astounding and very beneficial to the city of Paris and also to Europe as a whole.

Like in Paris, France, in Bogota Colombia, carfree days have been established. In the article, "" Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"", by Andrew Selsky, the Day Without Cars in Bogota is detailed. Like in Paris, there were fines for violators, however this time it is 25. Due to the fine, many of the 7 million resident used public transportation, taxis, bicycles in order to get where they needed to go. One resident said, ""It's a good way to take away stress and lower air pollution."" As a result of the success that Bogota has with these carfree days, more than 118 miles of bicycle paths have been made, sidewalks have been repaired, and many new restaurants and shopping districts have emerged. Other cities in Colombia and other cities in South America want to follow Bogota's lead. In the article, the mayor of Asuncion, Paraguay Enrique Riera, is quoted saying, ""These people are generating a revolutionary change, and that is crossing borders."" Hopefully, the carfree days that Bogota has will be common around South America and eventually around the world.

A new global trend is emerging and that is the decrease in car usage. Cities like Vauban, Germany has a large majority of its residents using public transportation and bicycles and many residents have acceoted and embraced this lifestyle. Cities like Paris and Bogota have partial driving bans and carfree days, respectively, and as a result smog and pollution in the air has decreased and many residents feel like it is a good way to take away stress. These changes bans and carfree days have lowered pollution dramatically and many feel like this is a good path for the future. Limiting car usage is beneficial to the world and these cities have proven that it can be achieved without many issues and hopefully many other cities around the world will copy this innovative new idea toward decreasing greenhouse emissions.",0,0.021349238,0,True
880EFB9368DA,"There is the argument whether student-designed projects or teacher-designed projects during academic breaks are better. When a teacher designs a project, it many times will not be feisable for a student going on a far-away vacation, enjoyable to the student's personal interests, or about what the student would like to study. Projects that students design can indulge into a subject they enjoy. Students learn better when they are studying something they love or relate to more. Simply having to design their own project will insure the student does their best work because they're studying something they love.

Generic_Name was given the oppotunity over her break to write a research paper on anything she wanted to spend the two weeks researching! Since she was at the beach and loved watching the seagulls swoop for cheese poofs and hop around, she wanted to learn more about them and write her paper on them. Generic_Name spent all of the time she devoted to her project outside, under an umbrella, watching the seagulls while she wrote! This allowed her to put in her own first hand observations of the actions of the silly birds! Generic_Name scored a 97 on her paper and she was praised for her first hand acounts of their actions and behaviors. Had she been given a research project designed by a teacher on something else, like Gandi or Italy, she wouldn't have connected with the topic in the same way, and would've been miserable the whole time writing it.

Generic_Name was tasked with bringing back a project ona different culture after his break, but his parents sprung on him they were going on a cruise and he wouldn't be allowed to take his laptop with him. Since the paper was due the day he got back, he had no choice but to spend the days before his trip in his room, on his computer writing to get it all done before he left. He had no time to spend with his friends and had to cancel plans because of this. His teacher, while grading the essay, noted there were many spelling errors and it seemed ""very rushed,"" and ended up giving him only a 73 for the project. Had he been given the oppotunity to design his own project, he would've had more time to enjoy his break and could've worked on it on the cruise, allowing him to keep his plans and spend time with his friends. The poor grade he recieved was just a slap in the face after the stress he'd been under about it.

Generic_Name was tasked by her teacher to write about the process of learning and to gain a new skill over the break, but she had to come up with a schedule on how to learn it, and pick what she wanted to learn. Generic_Name had always wanted to learn the piano, so she picked just that. She did research online about how long it takes to learn the piano, and signed up for an online course. Her goal was to be able to play a simple song by the end of the break. For the project, she tracked her progress in a journal, wrote about why she was learning different skills in the order she was, and how it was helping her understand. Finally, at the end of the break, she recorded herself playing a piece slightly harder than she originally expected, and submitted that with her project. Her teacher was so proud she played the recording for the class and everyone clapped! This student designed project definetly ensured she continued larning, and she ended up finding a new passion because of it; something that likely wouldn't happen if she was simply given a project to complete by her teacher.

Not all students are like Generic_Name though, and some need more structure. Generic_Name was one such student. He was given the topic of writing about an event in history and how it effected the world today, and how its effects have effected his own life. Generic_Name's probelm was that he had no clue how to relate history to his own life, and because of the lack of other guidance on it, he spent a lot of time sitting at his desk, staring at an empty Google Doc. When it came time to submit his project, Generic_Name only had a poorly written introduction and first paragraph. He quickly scribbled out two more, but they were riddled with errors, poor punctuation, and mistypes. He submitted the essay, and when he got back to school, he saw a 49 in red pen with the words ""See Me"" writen under it. He just needed more stucture and directions. A student designed project was not for Generic_Name.

Teachers who want their students to engage more in their work should give them projects they design themselves. It will really show who's willing to step up to the plate and work hard for the good grade when they have to do more work with fewer guidelines.",0,0.0066374307,0,True

One reason why summer projects from students. Because if the student designed their project they can choose their projects. For example, some students need an essay project but teachers give harder projects for students and they can't do this projects. And some students not have idea about the projects from teachers but when students choose their projects they have good ideas about their projects. However, some teachers did not like to students choose their projects .This is not the only reason summer projects from students is good.

Some may argue summer projects from teachers is good. This is because the teachers have more information about summer projects and they know what kind of projects is better for students. However, some students not have information about summer projects and they did not like to complete the summer projects from teachers in the summer.

2CBE6AD55BDD,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure learning over break. Should the summer projects be teacher designed or student designed. First the projects should be student designed, it shows more responsibility, creativity and effort. Second it gives the students' a better experience and shows different aspects of learning. Student designed projects will help the students' when they get older and move on to college and will have to do all of their work on their own.

First, the projects designed by the students show tremendous responsibility, creativity and effort. The student designed projects leave the students to do it on there own; they have to worry about they want to write, what they want to prove or what they need to show. This shows the student responsibility because it's a school project over the summer that they have to complete, which most students will not even attempt to try . They will have to do the project during their own free time. And do a little of it everyday until it's complete. They can't wait last minute to do the project because it will show when they turn the project in and get a bad grade. The project show's creativity, the students or making the project and didn't get a teacher designed project. They have to come up with the whole project by themselves with only a topic to start with. The students need a creative thought process to get the project done, and in a timely manner. The project shows effort by being able to complete it and doing it right the first time, by being able to sit down and do a school project that need's to be done and you're stuck doing it during the summer. It takes a lot of effort to do a project over the summer, which is your biggest break you have off school and the most busy break for some students with sports, traveling with your family and work.

Second, it gives the students' a better experience doing the project themselves and it can show different aspects of learning. It's a better experience doing it themselves because the project has to be complete by them, which is what they will have to do when they go off to college. They are not going to be able to get help from their professors' and the professors' are not going to design projects' for them in college they are going to have to learn to do it on their own. Which is a great learning opportunity for students' because it's not easy doing a project yourself and it takes practice to be able to make a good project. Doing projects can also show you different aspects of learning, By having to look up information for your project, having to do research on your topics for you to be able to complete your project. There might be some things you can't find to finish your project so you have to find valid resources, witnesses or read because you can't find anything you need on the internet, which shows a different aspect of learning because everything is on the internet nowadays.

I believe student designed projects would be a better learning perspective than teacher designed projects. Students have always got assignments by teachers and have to complete them how the teachers want them completed, the projects do over the summer is a different experience there is no teacher there to tell you what to do it's all on the student, his or her views on the subject. The student can use all of the sources they find and put it into one project that wouldn't be like other class mates because they get to write about what they would like too. The teacher assigned project is not a good idea, the students will just copy and paste and can't do anything on their own. The students will have the same information because they all got the same project from the teacher. Therefore student assigned projects or better for both teachers' and students'.

Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure learning over break. Should the summer projects be teacher designed or student designed. The student designed projects are a better way for students to learn responsibility, creativity, effort and also help learn different aspects of learning for when they go off too college. Therefore projects over the summer should be student designed and not teacher designed.        ",0,0.00697529,0,True
1EC5C39D73B1,"Dear state senator,

Election day is held every four years on the frist Tuesday in the month of November. When you elect for president would you perfer voting yourself and having your vote count or voting for someone who will then vote for your state and elect for the president of choice. For example, lets use the election of Obama versus MittRomeny. Imagnie if you voted for a man who said ""If you vote for me to repersent your state I will elect Obama!"" He might be tricking you and vote for MittRomeny when it is time for them to vote. That means your vote for them and that promise he made to your state dosn't matter because he wanted to voted for MittRomney and he knew majority of the state would go for Obama.

I believe that the Electoral College is wrong for the simple fact is that you do not know the intentions of the reperesentors. For example, in article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" it states in section ""What's wrong with the electoral college"" that ""Back in 1960, segregations in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic eletors with new electros who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kenndey.) In the same vein, 'faithless' electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please.... Oh, and what state sends two electors to Congress? It happenend in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily, Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the Senate, validated only his opponent's electors, but he made sure to do so 'without establishing a precedent'"" This ststement shows that whoever is running can overthrow the other by chaning the mind of their electors.

Also it state in the the same article and same section that ""ATt the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know have no chance of winning, focuding only  on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. During the 2000 campaign, seventenn states didn't see the candidiates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didin't get to see a single campaign ad."" That means the states who did not get to see campaign ads blindly vote for an elector who will then blindly vote for a president.

I believe that popular voting will be a lot better because so that everyone can vote and not just one person picking for an entier state. Also in popular voting campagin ads will be seen in every state and everybody can make their own choices so noone is blindly voting. At the end after each state is done voting, all the votes will be added together, and a president will be chosen by majoirty rules. So state senator, what is your choice?    ",0,0.0075645796,0,True

87958B77E2DC,"Have you ever asked someone for advice but still not been sure about your decision? If so you should have tried asking more people. Asking multiple people for advice is a great way to see different sides of an argument. Three reasons to ask for multiple opinions are different views, not a biased outcome and, better reasoning for the final verdict.

The first reason that it is good to get multiple opinions is different views is because people may see the same problem but get a different answer. This then allows you to get more idea of the outcome of the solution that you may not have seen before. It is also good to get different opinions because you may get different views and you still don't have a set answer, you can decide based on the number of people who voted each way.

The second reason is that it is good to get a non-biased answer is so that you don't miss an opportunity because you asked one person who dislikes something that you wanted to do. When you get multiple opinions you set yourself up to get a non-biased opinion so that you are not unfair to one side of an argument. A non-biased opinion is extremely important when it comes to a big decision that could hurt you later on in life so it just a good idea to make sure you see both sides of an argument.

The final reason is that you get a better final decision out of it. The reason for this is because you are putting in more time by asking more people that you really get to think about the problem at hand. This helps because sometimes people end up ruining themselves by rushing headfirst into something without thinking about the consequences that the decision may have. The reason you are asking multiple people in the first place is so that you can get a better final verdict on the topic so you know you aren't making a mistake by doing something.

Three reasons that getting multiple opinions is a good thing are different views, a non-biased answer and, a better final verdict. Which is why I believe that getting multiple opinions is the smart thing to do.",0,0.006731267,0,True

The author of ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", Nick D'Alto, talks about new technology called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), which enables computers to identify human emotions. The use of this technology in a classroom to read the emotional expressions of students would be valuable so the teacher can see how well they have to students attention and what they can do to change things if they need to. If teachers had the ability to use the FACS, they would be able to see how many students enjoy the class and that they are focused on the class. Also they would be able to see how many kids aren't happy to be in class and no paying attention. The FACS can read the emotions happiness, surpise, anger, disgust, fear, and saddness. A teacher wants to have all the attention of their students but, it doesn't always happen, teachers knowing when students start to fade out of the topic can help them change how they are teacher to help the student want to learn and stay on task. All around students need to learn and teachers need to teach, it would be very useful to have teachers be able to access the FACS to be able to teach to the best of their abilities so that the students car and will learn.

9434A2466218,"Dear Principal:

I am really against the rule, you can't participate in any sports or other activities without a B average as your grade. I think that the reason all of the students have C' s is because they are not in any sports or other activities. It is a proven fact that if you put a student in a sport or other activities, they will do better in school. So i think you should lower the bar to a 75% grade average and when they start doing better in school, raise it back up to having a B average. Also if that doesn't work then maybe you can talk to the student and the parents to see what going on. But I am sure that if listen to what i am saying, my idea will work .

Many students struggle with school, so if you lower the average down so the students can do sports and other activities it can help them learn the stuff in school a different way for them to understand. But as soon as there grades go up and prove that they can keep them up then you can raise the grade average to a B. Also if you start out with a B average then many students might think that your saying there to dumb to do a sport or other activities. Next thing you know, there grades are dropping even lower. That is what I have to say about you trying to raise the grade average to early as B .

8870ED6EA009,"Extracurricular activities are very important to not only your success at school but also your success in life. Not only does being in a club or sport help you grow, it also affects how colleges and bosses see you as a person. Participating in extracurricular activities can open many doors such as, acquiring new skills, becoming a more well rounded person, and meeting new people which can also lead to new opportunities.

In life your going to meet many people, some will stick with you and some won't, but you will learn something from each and everyone of them. Extracurricular activities will lead you to meet all of the different people in your school that may share some of the same interest as you. For example maybe a student decides to join the lacrosse team and none of your friends do. The student ends up meeting lots of people who also like trucks and fishing and hunting. If the student would not have participated an extracurricular activity, they would have never met their new friends. Another way doing clubs and sports will help you is the teachers or coaches getting to know you. For instance say an eight grader joins the art club, the art teacher never really knew you before. But, since you have been going to the club the whole year, the art teacher loves your attitude and thinks you are very talented . Then you are picking you classes for high school and you want to do a photography class, but you need you are teachers recommendation. The student that was in the club is more likely to get a recommendation than the kid who just took art. Meeting new people who also may give you new opportunities is a essential and will help throughout life.

Accumulating a new skill happens almost everyday to everybody. A skill can range from a way to write a story to a new way to shoot a basketball. In life you obtain so many skills and being in different clubs or activities can help you share them among many people. For example, a student joins the yearbook club. The student has never really been very good with computers, but is really good with cameras. Many of the students who are in that club are great at editing, but dont have great camera skills. With both of the student skills put together they work perfectly, but also the can teach the skills to one another. Another skill that is acquired through any club or sport you decide to do is, how to interact with others. There are many shy people but also many loud people. A shy person can view a very actively talking person and find new skill and maybe they wont be as shy because they know how to start a conversation and since they are in a extracurricular activities with people that share the same interest as them, they will be able to talk about club related subjects. Lastly, someone can learn how to play a sport. A large number of people play a sport, but usually not every sport. So, a student could give a different sport you don't play a shot. Maybe there is a student that runs track, swims, plays soccer and field hockey. But, they decide to play volleyball. Since they are required to do a club or sport they made this decision, but if they were not required to they most likely would have not tried anything new. Once they started playing the learned many skills and ended up being one of the best on the team. Making extracurricular activities mandatory could be beneficial to a lot of students and might even help hem find their true talent.

A well-rounded human being can have different definitions, but usually it means someone who can balance. Not the kind of balance of standing or walking across a tightrope, but more like having loads of work to do and getting it done quickly and quietly. It also means to be someone who helps others, which can range from friends to your whole community. At some schools there is Student Council Association and Youth Volunteer Corps. Both Student Council Association and Youth Volunteer Corps help the community and are extracurricular activities. These two clubs usually have people that are caring and want to help others in it, but they also have good grades and manage to do other activities. Another way student are well rounded is when they have multiple friends. While they usually have a few close friends they are also friendly and easily can make friends with anyone who sits with them. With extracurricular activities they could make even more friends or just be nice to someone new. They could also share their actions with new people who might decide to be more like the well rounded student. Finally, they can be friends with the teachers. To build a relationship with the teacher you can join a club that is run by a teacher. It is hard to talk to teachers during class and get to know them. But, once it is the club time and they can talk to a student with fewer people and where the don't have to teach, the student can actually get to know the teacher. This can be helpful in many way, they can understand your way of learning and be able to help you better and like what was mentioned before they can help with a recommendation for school or even maybe a job. Without extracurricular activities people wouldnt be able to be as well rounded as they could potentially be because they wouldn't be able to connect with others.

Extracurricular activities could help so many people in all kinds of ways. While their could be some problems with depletion of time, obtaining the skill or even the amount of school work they have to do after. There is ways around those kind of problems and they could easily be fixed. Joining clubs and sports teams can be very beneficial to everyone involved and learning new skills, meeting new people and becoming a well rounded person is just a few reasons to make extracurricular activities mandatory.",0,0.0073601934,0,True
AC89F6717544,"Phones & Driving 1. Today the majority of adults and teens own or operate a cell phone. The average person is claimed to spend about three hours on a cellular device daily, for others that number is much higher. With cell phones constantly being upgraded and advancing, it makes it more tempting for individuals to buy them and cause people to use them more than what is necessary. This leads to adults and teens to even be tempted to use them even while on the road. Should drivers be able to use a cell phone in any captivity while behind the wheel? Even if it's for something as simple as only using it for GPS directions. It's all up to the way the driver uses that privilege. The usage of a phone while driving should be avoided as much as possible, especially texting and driving. When you think about it, texting and driving is the equivalent to driving intoxicated or under the influence. By taking the chance and texting while driving Your putting you and innocent pedestrians in danger.

Too many people have lost their lives because someone was not being cautious, being on their device and not paying attention to the road, distracted by their phone trying to reply to a simple message that can wait till you are safely parked or not on the road. Why risk getting a ticket and having to pay money or even getting arrested or possible taking a life just by being careless and making a little mistake you could have easily refrained from. Your only increasing the chance of you getting into an accident and endangering someone's life, and if a wreck does happen is likely insurance would cost more because of the situation. You being in the wrong and caused the wreck, meaning you would have to pay more for the insurance Texting and driving is not only very dangerous it has been made illegal but yet there are still individuals who feel they just need to use their phone while behind the wheel. In conclusion, the overall usage of a cell phone.....that's why teenagers shouldn't drive with the cell phone an be on the phone because u can be focused on the phone with messages and calling an get in a crash an that's good if You got a GPS but phone are not good while driving in the dark it can costed Accident especially when you can't see an got the light in yo face an it's always good to have another person in the car with a phone an your driving.

534835158D10,"""Why should I ask another person for advice?"", ""Do I really need someone else opinion?"" are all questions you may be asking when you are about to make a decide on whether you want to consult someone else in your final decision. People tend to hesitate before asking someone to help them because they are not sure if they want another persons view that is contrary to theirs. Having multiple people adding and sharing knowledge is a good idea if you want to make the most educated choice. It is crucial to consult more than one person for their opinion or advice about something when you are looking for the best choice you could possibly make .

By asking multiple people for advice or an opinion you will receive helpful bits of information along the way. Each person comes from a different background, they all have their own knowledge and ideas. Consulting different people will lead to tons of information on whether you are making the best choice. One example is that publishers make authors send their books to professional editors, editors advise the authors to add some of their ideas and fix any mistakes that are shown. This goes to show that having another person that will give helpful bits of information will help make a much better decision.

Talking to more people and consulting with them for advice or an opinion leads to more ideas. Based on what the other person says you can always make a decision on whether to input their ideas into yours or if you want to disregard their idea. For example when a student is about to hand in an assignment they always have someone peer review/edit to add ideas or tell them what they think needs to be fixed. Most students do this because they want to have someone else view and improve on their work. By inputting the other persons opinions and using the advice that was given the student will turn in the better version of the assignment than what the student was about to turn in beforehand.

When you ask another person for advice or an opinion you get a new outlook and perspective each time. Each person views something differently. Having multiple view points is important if you want to see how each person inter prates what you are saying, and see whether you like the way they see it, or if you want to change it to be perceived in a different way. Something doctors do is they refer you to another doctor to get a second opinion. They do this because the other doctors may catch something that the original doctor did not catch the first time. This example goes to show that everyone has a different outlook on things and see things that some people may not see.

It is crucial to consult more than one person for their opinion or advice about something when you are looking for the best choice you could possibly make. By asking them for their advice or opinion you will get a different perspective on your choice, you will also receive tons of ideas and information to help make a good decision. Having more people consult on a decision helps the person making the final decision narrow down and decide what choice they should make.

4BF47B5D416B,"Imagine taking a two week vacation from work after working extra hard for those vacation days; now imagine having to work during those hard earned vacation days. Now consider that on a larger scale of working roughly nine to eight months for three to two months of break, this is school. In Generic_City depending on the class there may or may not be a summer assignment, for example, most math classes require you to do a review packet or start the first unit, as was the case for statistics. English classes usually require you to read at least one book, and depending on what level English class there may be an analysis. Personal experience and differing personal conditions prove that students should not be required to complete summer assignments whether they're teacher or student designed.

Personal experience has shown me that summer assignments are no where near as effective as teachers believe. As someone who has both done it and seen it happen a lot, I know for a fact that the mass majority of students don't truthfully complete the assignments themselves. They'll either wait for one person to complete it and as soon as one completed assignment is sent to someone it might as well been sent to all since each grade is pretty well connected and the use of phones makes cheating easier. The other way students will cheat is by using the internet; some assignments are one Google search away from having the entire answer key. With the mass cheating summer assignments become nothing more than a nuisance to both the students and teachers who have to read and grade the same work. Another reason I believe there shouldn't be summer assignments is because it's unfair to the students that work their butts of during the school year to have to then complete more work during their break. The school year is long but some students grind out the whole year making the most out of their education while other burn out. To these students summer assignments are the equivalent of unpaid working hours. Not to mention the long school year has more than enough time to account for review.

People's differing conditions during the summer further enforce the unimportant nature of summer assignments. In my case I was in Generic_City all summer last year and spent a lot of time out in the rural areas. It was literally impossible for me to complete any of my assignments without internet. I needed to read and take notes on the first chapter of Statistics from scanned textbook pages and had a precalculus packet to complete. This wouldn't have been a problem for me if I had access to a working printer or WiFi. Sadly I had neither so I ended up having to do all my summer work in the three days I had from when I came back from Generic_City to when I had school. This was very unpleasant since I stayed home those three days completing my assignments and by the time I got back to school it had felt like I didn't even have a break. Another reason that there shouldn't be summer assignments is because some students work during the summer. My friend Generic_Name works with his dad's masonry company during the summer to help him cut cost and increase productivity. Whether it's because they're helping their parents or investing in their own future; students time becomes more costly during the summer and the benefits of summer assignments comes no where near the cost.

Some teachers may argue that their work is impossible to cheat on because of xyz or that if students don't work on something during the summer or they'll forget everything they learned. To this I say that teachers don't give students enough credit and that once something has been taught it should be solid in a student mind otherwise it wasn't taught correctly. I've seen some crafty ways students try to get by an assignment that's hard to cheat on and if summer assignments where student designed this would only get worse. Some students are very determined to not do their assignments the ""correct"" way; I've seen people spend more energy trying to cheat than they would have if they had done their assignment properly. Others may also argue that to a student school is the most important priority they have; so instead of working to help keep their family fed they should be reviewing algebra II. This is absolute blaspheme although I agree that education is important it is ultimately up to the student to weigh their choices, and make the best decision for themselves. I am 90% confident that summer assignments don't fall within most students priority list.

Due to differing levels of importance and my own personal experiences students should not have to complete summer assignments whether they're teacher or student designed. For the students in the past who've lost precious time from assignments where instead they could have been working, relaxing, or spending time with friends and can no longer do these things have had wrong done by them. For future students that'll find summer assignments as an even larger nuisance since it's no longer detrimental that students learn/memorize since almost everything is going to be at their finger tips instead their goal will be application. It is largely important that schools eliminate the requirement for summer assignments.      ",0,0.007877717,0,True

E2E2F1025D32,"In the story the author presented both sides fairly. He stated the positives and negatives of driverless cars. I belive that driveless cars could soon be a common thing everybody uses.

First thing that might be a big problem is that they use radars and those can cost two hundred million dollars, that right there is a down side. One of the positives of the car it can do is that BMW announced the ""Traffic Jam Assistant."" The car can go as fast as 25 mph, but you have to keep you're hand's on the wheel. The car can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves. It is all design to let the driver know the road ahead requires human skills, such as nabigating through work zones and around accidents. BMW's project manager driver said that it hopes to bring in-car entertainment and information systems. Some of the display can be turned off when the driver must take over. The in-car system is a great safety feature. One of the biggest down fall is the law. The law focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe. They also said that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. Because of this most states, it is illegal to even test computer-driven cars. Some manufactures believe that even more states will follow as soon as the cars are proven more reliably safe. One of the biggest question is that if the technology fails and someone happens to be injured, who fault is it? Is it the driver or the manufacturer? I believe it would be the drivers fault because it was there fault they decide try to have a driveless car. This is one reason many people won't want to buy those type of cars. Even thought it has a big problem it can also be use for good things. Google cofounders said he can foresees they the cars will use half the fuel of today's taxi and is far more flecibiloty than a bus. Everybody wants to save money of gas so everybody would want to own one. He also stated that the cars would change the world. Another good thing is that if you're running late and you don't know that fastest way to get there, you can get you're car to drive you there while the car is taking the fastest way. If you are on a road trip and you been driving for six hours stright, you might get board of driving. So that's when you activate the car to drive by it's self, instead of stopping and taking a break and take long on the trip. If the car is driving when you're taking a break, then you will get to you're desination faster. But that could still be a while before we can do that. Driverless cars have a lot to work on before that can truly happen.

What to I think about driverless cars? I believe they can become a everyday thing we use. The only thing few thing stopping use from that is money and the law. Once we can get the more to start making these and we make a driveless-car that can meet the requirements, then we can start pumping out these cars that everbody would want to have.

5DD3A198CF10,"In the United States, car wrecks because of distracted drive are increasing. The leading reason to distracted driving is cell phones. While most people appear to be aware of the dangers of using the cellphone while driving, they even continue to take this risk. What would it take to make people to quit utilizing their cell phones while operating their car?

Cell phones have become a part of many people's daily lives, making it a struggle for them to sit the down long enough to drive and reach their destination. In 2015, six hundred and sixty thousand drivers in the United States were calculated to have cellphones in hand while behind the wheel. Cellphone usage while traveling has become the number one cause for vehicle accidents over the last two decades.

Using the phone while driving increases not only the driver, but the people around them chances of getting into an accident. In addition to it lessens the driver's awareness of their surroundings while on the road, causing more car accidents. ""Auto deaths have risen for two straight years, marking the biggest increase in more than dive decades. While lower gas prices have encouraged more driving, distracted driving due to cellphones has been tapped as one of the major causes. That has prompted many states to begin cracking down on phone use while driving with laws outlawing the behavior."" (Pressman, A..Apr.2017)

An increasing amount of states, prohibit the usage of cell phones while behind the wheel, exposing those drivers who break the laws to fines and additional punishments. What many drivers don't realize is that, not only could they receive fines for using their phone, but they could also be served with serious lawsuits if they cause an accident.

A large number of drivers do not believe that their driving performance is impacted by the usage of their cellphones. More than one half of drivers who speak on cell phones while driving feel as if their driving is no different from them being off the phone. This shows that many people are ignorant to the impact they have on their selves and others when they use their phones while driving. This also shows why it's so important to have such strict rules and laws. ""Road safety appears to improve in states with laws that regulate driver's phone use. The states with the lowest amount of phone use while driving- Vermont, Oregon, Hawaii, and Washington- have all banned the use of handheld devices behind the wheel.""(Johnson, D.Apr.2018)

To sum it up, the use of phones while driving has proven to be a huge safety hazard to drivers and those surrounding them. There should be laws in all states and even countries that ban the use of any device or distraction while driving in order to decrease the number of accidents on the road. It would also help people to practice using their phones less and become not so dependent on their phones.            ",0,0.0074226228,0,True

Do you think drivers should use their phones while operating a vehicle? Do you think it is safe to be on your phone while driving? Well in this essay I will be explaining why I don't think drivers shouldn't operate a vehicle while driving.

Many accidents occur when drivers get on the road and are distracted by their phones. A lot of people had their life taken away from them when people were driving and being on the phone. Too young adults, too adults we all have been guilty for being too addicted to our phone including me but it is a time and a place to be on your phone and not to be on your phone. As a young adult, I know and understand the risk of driving and being distracted by my phone. Many cases have been reported on the death of people who were texted and driving. I know sometimes you want to send out the text message to your friends or your loved one. I know you want to check your email to see if you got hired for the job you want. however, you shouldn't be on your phone while trying to drive. That is highly dangerous for you and the other person who is driving in the next car.

You should be focused on the road, not on your phone because it can only take one look away from the road to cause a serious car accident that can do two things death or put you in a critical injury .using your phone can cause serious damage while driving because you are trying to do two things at one time. Let me explain when you're driving you should be focusing on the road nothing else because you can't be on be focusing on two things at the same time that's is impossible. another reason is that there are some people, not all that drive crazy and that's don't pay attention to the other car they drive fast and don't care about the other people driving. So while driving you have to focus on more than one thing and I know that people probably say that""

but I have always been on my phone when I am diving all the time and I haven't been in an accident"". that might be the case, however, it doesn't guarantee that it will not happen. in reality, it only takes one time for something that can change your life forever. These days there is a law for that now and police are locking up people for that or giving them a ticket. But what if you were the unfortunate ones that died because the police didn't catch you on your phone?

In conclusion, if you don't want to be in jail for killing someone because you're distracted then you can pull over to send that text, check your Instagram or your email. Your life and freedom are more important than the people on your phone. even if you don't feel like going that then have someone else in the car with you who can drive so that you can check/reply to your text message. does it have to take you to kill someone to learn the lesson?

Being in extracurricular activities is a way to try new things that you might not have known you like. I think all students should participate in extracurricular activities because you can explore something you haven't before, you can make friends, and you might find that it's something you enjoy.

Participating in an extracurricular activity allows you to explore different options that you haven't before. Trying new things is a good way to see what you like and dislike. You could realize that you love to play sports through extracurricular activities. You could also gain experience. Having experience in different fields can be helpful for academic and life purposes. Participating in an extracurricular activity might be helpful for the future. It could help with getting a job and it could end up being your career path. Getting the opportunity to explore new things is a reason you should participate in extracurricular activities.

Making friends is also a bonus when you are in an activity. You can find people with similar interests as you. Starting conversations with others is easier if you're in the same activity as them. You could have fun while participating with others. Doing things with other people can make you enjoy the activity more. Participating is also an opportunity for you to meet new people you wouldn't have known if you weren't in an extracurricular activity. You could make long lasting friendships you wouldn't have made if you didn't participate. Being in an extracurricular activity is a fun way to make new friends.

The downside is that you would be forced to be in an activity. If you are forced to do something, it can make the activity less fun. However, you could find that the activity is something you really like to do. You can find out new things about yourself or find a new hobby.

B537B5DDA2EB,"The article ""The challenge of Exploring Venus"" is about the author trying to get me to think that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. What that line is saying is even though Venus is a dangerous place it shouldn't stop you in wanting to go and explore it, to find out more about our solar system. Me as a girl, I don't know if I would want to go travel Venus in knowing that it is very dangerous and has very big risk factors. In this article though the author made me look at it with a bigger perspective. He put some points in that I really liked that got me over the perspective of Venus is a dangerous place. Here are some of the points, if we took the challenege to go visit Venus we would get to see what the Earth-like planet looks like, the understnading of what Venus has on its planet and challenges that we have on Earth should not be limited by dangers, but it should make our imagination and innovation meet bigger standards.

The author said that the closest planet to earth is Venus. Earth and Venus are known as twins. The question is why would anyone want to go visit Venus if it is so dangerous. It's because Venus is the Earth-like planet in our solar system. It is the closest planet that you can study and it is like Earth. People want to discover more about it to see what more the two planets have in common. They know that long time ago Venus had earth like features and was once able to support various forms of life. Now they know that it still has some features earth has. Like a rocky surface, with craters, mountains, and valleys. People want to be able to study Venus so we can see why they can't support forms of life and how it came to be that way.

The second point that caught my attention as I was reading this article, is that how are you going to understand Venus without going their and putting some sort of camera or a human there to get some pieces of Venus. We want to understand Venus so we can start understanding other planets. We start with Venus because it is the closest to Earth and it is similar to earth so we can compare and see what other planets might have in common and what they are like. We want to understand why 97 percent of carbon dioxide covers Venus. We also are trying to figure out why their temperatures andd conditions are extremely worse than any human being on Earth has encoutered. This topic made me realize that starting to understnad Venus can help us start understanding other planets and not just others but our own planet too.

The third point that really caught my eye and has made me think is at the end of the article the author says ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"". This is a very good point to end the article with because he is trying to tell us that don't let things that you fear get in the way of you imagination. Don't let your fears make you from doing something that might change your life in a good way. The author adds this at the end because he wants us to see that he isn't letting the fears of how dangerous Venus is from stopping him from going there and seeing what it is like in the future. It might not even be him, it could be him talking to others saying Venus is okay to go visit because it will open you imagination and innovation.

In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author makes it very obvious that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. He put in multiple points and backed them up with information. The author was very clear in stating why he thinks it is important to keep trying to find a way to visit Venus despite the difficulties. The three points that caught my eye were if we took the chance to go see Venus we would see the Earth-like planet in our solar system, the understanding of what Venus has on its planet, and the challenges that we have on earth should not be limited by dangers, but it should make our imagination and innovation meet biggers standards. I know for sure that if I had the opprotunity to find out more information that could help us in this world but it was dangerous I would find a way to still do it or something I can do to help make it safer for others to do.

E09853233CCF,"Voting. Voting is a pretty big deal that only comes around so many years. And with voting the citizens of the U.S. have a voice. And also the voting method in which the president is elected by popular votes is just fine and it should be the only way people vote for their president. No one else should vote for them. The people have the right to choose who ever they want. And no one has the right to vote for any other person but them. The popular is just fine because first of all the popular vote for president method is more fair than the electoral college voting method. Secondly, the popular vote for president is less complicated, where as the electoral college can cause complications and problems.

To start off, the popular vote for president is more fair than the electoral college. First, there really is no way of cheating in the popular vote method because people vote once for whom ever they want to be president out of the people elected and then the president is chosen that way. The popular votes method is more fair because candidates spend a little time in every if not majority of the states, depending on how much time they have. But as stated in the article written by Bradford Plumer in the electoral college voting method ""candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states."" That is not fair every state should be able to see the candidates who are going to be serving the country and see what they are like and how they can help the country. And this has happened before where the candidates didn't even bother showing up in some of the states. One example would be as stated in the article By Bradford Plumer ""during the 2000 campaign, seventeeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" Now how on earth can people vote for their new president if they have absoloutley no idea of what the president is capable of doing to help or even hurt the country.

Next, the popular vote for president is less complicated, unlike the electoral college where complications, problems, and just a big mess could happen. With the popular vote it is pretty straight forward and simple. The people vote for whom ever they want to be their next president and serve the country, the votes get counted up and whoever has the most votes gets to be the new president. But with the electoral college if a tie had occured as stated in the article written by Bradford Plumer ""the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president.(The Senate would choose the vice-president.) Because each state casts only one vote, the single from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters."" Now that sure seems to be complicated. Just one vote represents 500,000 or 35 million voters. The popular vote method is a lot more simple it doesn't require all of these steps. With the popular vote everyone votes and the majority of the votes is the winner, as simple as that. It doesn't require going to the representatives who vote for themselves and a whole bunch of other people as well.

In conclusion, the popular vote method is better because it is more fair. It gives people a voice to choose for whom ever they want not what anybody else wants. Also, the popular vote method is a whole lot less complicated than the electoral college. Where if there is a tie the representatives vote for themselves and are also representing thousands of other people who may or may not want that specific candidate to be president. So voting is no joke it is serious and it shouldn't be taken as a joke either. Every person should have a voice they should be able  to vote for who ever they desire. No one else should be able to vote for them, not even the representatives. Voting is no joke.                                                                               ",0,0.0069760955,0,True
71703F0C0ABD,"Students should design their own summer projects because they can make the project about things they learned over the summer or while they were in school. Having to the project in their own way should make it more better for the students to learn more on how to make a project, come up with ideas about the project, and get the feel on how to do things on their own without a teachers assistants. Having a project to do on you own makes things go easier for you without a teacher way of how they want the project to be. Although if a teacher designs the summer project for the students it will save the trouble of a student having to think of what their project should be about and the students will not just make the project on anything they shouldn't make it about.

Firstly, if the students design the project of their decisions they will feel more comfortable working on something they designed without a teachers opinion and they can do it at their own paste instead of having a teacher telling them when its due. And when students design the projects by them selves they get a chance to teach themselves more and learn more from their mistakes so when next time they have a project to do they will have it down packed. Also the students can take summer school where they can have access to book to help they with there summer project and computers where they can get resources to look up information about the project their designing. But students should take the project serious so they can understand how to make projects on their own so if a time comes when they to do it again without any assistants it will be more be better the next time.

Secondly, if the students design the summer project it will be more fun if they deign it because there friends can all help and work together to make the project fun and they can challenge each other to see who can make the best project and but also in a correct way. The project can also be fun because the project can be about things they like such as a favorite sport, favorite food, or even favorite place to go doing this should make the students more interested in doing the project on there own without a teacher. If the students can make the summer project more fun by making the the project about things they wanna or like doing it will push the the students to make to project strong and more topic related so that the students wont get off topic. Another way the students could make the project more fun is making it more about them so they can be relax and want to the project .

Thirdly, it helps the students practice more on projects if they design it their selves by doing this it teaches the students how to handle situation like this throughout life and they can over come that if they dont use help for a teacher or anyone. Also if they keep practicing how to make projects on their own they can help others in need of help making and thinking of ideas of how to make their project this is why know how to make project on your own helps out a lot. Making projects teaches you a lot about yourself you find out what you need help on and what your good at designing a project can be a lot of work but you can do it if you practice a lot if your doing them yourself. Practicing how to design project can be really helpful to you in so many ways and knowing how to make projects can help when your in school and needing to do a class project with other students that doesnt know how to make their own project.

In summary, students designing their own projects will better them if they have to make another project on there own rather in school, work, or even summer projects. Without a teacher designing the project for the students they can get ideas of how to do it there selves in need of a time to make projects by them self. Also if teachers design a project for students the students might not like the summer project the teacher assigned for them to do and they wont do the project in that case they wont learn anything. Therfore students should be allowed to design their own projects without a teacher idea of how it should be designed and they can make it how they want to without the teachers opinion and they will want to do it.    ",0,0.0076035154,0,True
560E63BEB028,"Although the idea of driverless cars sounds fantastic, it seems a little too good to be true. I have faith in the engineers who will be designing the cars, but I have less faith in the people who will be in these self-driving cars.

As stated in the article ""the Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over"". That sounds easy enough, but what if the driver fell asleep? What if the driver had some kind of medical emergency and they fainted? What if the driver is paying too much attention to their phone to notice that there is an abstacle or accident ahead? What if? These are questions I don't want to answer from first hand experience. I do not trust other people to be responsible and ready to take action when the time comes for them to drive, perphaps in case of an emergency. At the same time, I do not want to put my life in the hands of a machine. Something could always malfunction.

When I think about future generations and how they might not have to learn how to drive, I get a little sentimental. Ever since cars have been around, its been a major milestone in a young peron's life to get their drivers license. Its a right of passage to becoming an adult. Getting your driver's license signals that you're independent. If self-driving cars really do become a thing of the future, getting a license might not be necessary, and young adults will no longer have this important right of passage.

Driving a car is a skill. Take NASCAR driving for example; its a sport based on skillful driving. Driving a car develops hand-eye coordination, quick reflexes, and problem solving abilities. If drivers make self-driving cars their main mode of transportation, they will no longer be developing these skills through driving. Driving your own car puts your life and others lives in your hands and forces you to think responsibily. Drivers will become careless and nonchalant about driving if they have driveless cars.

Who's to say that driverless cars are going to be revolutionary or fatal? The bottom line is that I'm putting my life into the hands of the car, and I only have one life. Why would I risk it?            ",0,0.010261708,0,True

I understand that you are reconsidering the school's cell phone policy. I realize that you are considering two policy. Allowing students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class. And, not allowing students to us cell phones at all at school. I think that you should allow students to use the cell phones during free time.

I believe that you should allow students to use their cell phones. If they can use their cell phones during free time they won't have the urge to use the cell phones during class. When they use them during free time they talk to all the people that want to talk to. Some people don't get to see their friends during free time so they will most likely call or text to their friends during free time. If they cant call or text during free time at all they will try to text during class so that they can talk. If students cant bring their cell phones to school then they could not use their phone for after school activities or an emergency.

There are some disadvantages to letting students use their cell phones during free time. One, letting them use their cell phones during free time makes them want to text or call more so, they might do it during class. ii they do that then it will take away from their learning.

It could go either way on this decision. But, being a student i would like to be able to use my cell phone during free time. I also do a lot of after school activities so, i wouldn't be able to call my mom for a ride if i needed one.

In 1976 the Face was funny looking and later on in the years the Face blured out. It looks like a natural landform because people think just because it has eyes and a nose.

According to the arictle states the scientist belived the Face was an alien artifact. But I think how would you that it's an alien the world has so many different fetures, and creatures everywhere you may never know. Even though know ones probaly every seen an alien before. It may have been the shape or form they way the ground grew, and it just turn out to look like a face.

Then the found out on April 5,1998 that Micheal Mailn snapped a picture ten times finding out it was just a natural landform. I wounder why they thought that it was an alien. They got a camera on board to see if another may have poped up scientist checking it. If they would find one then it would be proof ,because now they have a camera on board to see.

I think that the rule of thumb is great because you can't discren things in to image 3 times bigger. It may look like something that it's not and apper wrong to look like an creature. What the picture actually shows is Martian equivalent butte and it and the Amercian West landforms are both in comman. It's a lava dome that takes form of a islated mesa looking ,and having same hieght of the Face on Mars.

5F1314EFC0BF,"Many schools use summer projects to insure that students are still learning during summer break. Some people would say these projects should be designed by the teachers. Whereas others would say the projects should be designed by the students. For many reasons, summer projects should be designed by the teachers.

Teachers are more organized in their planning. If a student organizes a summer project then there would not be a project to turn in, because some students are irresponsible and dont even know how to put together a project and will not ask for someone to teach them. Teachers would also be able to control what the projects about, how its going to be made, and when its going to be turned in. If a student decides what the project is about, how its going to be made, and when to turn it in then the teachers when school starts would have a very unorganized load of unknown projects to grade.

Projects are much easier for teachers to grade if the projects are on one subject. If a student is able to design his or her own project then there would be many topics that don't even match what the class is for. Letting a student design a summer project would be like letting a student design their own test and giving it to the teacher to grade. Then the teacher would have to find the answers to the test, make an answer sheet, and grade over two hundred individualized papers. Thats why teachers make their own test for the students to take so that the teachers have one test to grade it wont take hours to grade it will take minutes.

Some may say by letting the students organize and plan their own summer project would help boost their imagination. Though thats true, letting the teachers make a creative project would also boost the students imagination. Teachers need to be able to grade the papers which goes back to organization. A student can be creative when doing the project but when actually designing the project, teachers have to have a subject for the students to do the project on. Otherwise the teachers for summer reading would have to read every book a student has read over the summer instead of assigning just one book for everyone to read, or even in history class if a teacher just hands out a project with no subject then the student could easily do the project on something they haven't even learned.

It is the teachers job to give the student something to do. It is not the teachers job to overwhelm the students with designing their own project. If a teacher can design and give out home work then they should also be able to design and give out summer project for students to do. Teachers are not paid to sit in their chair and say "" Theres a project, figure it, out have a good summer."" They are paid to actually create and design a project, give it to the students with instructions on how to do it, and say "" This is due the first week of school have a great summer."" ",0,0.007091065,0,True

To me community service is very important. It helps others who are in need. If you want to assign people to do community service go right ahead. But most people don't want to because they think it's a waste of there time.

So you can solve this one way, you can show these students how great charity is!

For example helping clean up litter is a great way to prevent pollution. And reading to young children helps there education. Talking to elders gives them hope, and helping the homeless keeps them alive.

If you can show these student that its not a waste of time then maybe they will help. My advice is to prove to them that community service is a great thing. If people can take up about two hours of there lives for charity, then the world would be a better place to live in. And not just our school should do this i think everyone should.

But you cant force people to do community service if they don't want to because most likely they wont show up. And then they will get an F on that assignment, and they will fail!.. And nobody wants that.

if they don't want to do a great thing for the planet, or for young children or even family's or elders then that's there problem, they can just do extra credit. But i still think you should show them how it will help the world. Ex; Have an assembly to talk about community service!..

If you do decide that you want to assignee the task of community service, then i would like the position of helping homeless people. i think they need more help than anybody. But that's just my opinion. I would like to donate food and clothing to a fund who does help homeless people.

i think that this assignment is a wonderful idea!

Lots of people always argue about being able to have their phones while driving, but that shouldn't be debatable. Not only do you put your life in risk, but you put other peoples life in risk. So many car accidents are caused because of texting and driving, most these accidents involved by teens. You should not be using your phone while you drive. Doing that puts everyone around you in danger. So is one text really worth it, is it worth putting your life in danger and others. It is extremely dangerous, because once you are on your phone you can't take your eyes off your phone.

Everyday in the United States Of America around one out of ten people are killed by distracted drivers, and those drivers are distracted by their phone, causing them to lose control of the vehicle, putting people at risk of losing their lives. Texting and driving has been the biggest districation in the world. Every year, 21% of fatal car crashes involving teenagers between the ages of 16 and 19 were the result of using their cell phone while behind the wheel. This will increase 4% every year, and will be the resulting in more car accidents. No only do teenagers text and drive, but one fifth of an adult in the united states has been texting in driving.

Some people believe just because they are good drivers and it's just one text, nothing bad can happen but that is completely wrong. One text can change your entire life. It does not matter if you are a great driver like you may think, no one is a good driver. If another person who is being distracted by using their phone, they are not being a careful driver, in a flash of your eyes, you are putting your own life in danger because of the actions you are choosing to follow, which also puts the people around you in danger.

Some people argue that if they take their eyes off the road to look at their phone. No harm is being done to anyone, but so many things can happen in that one second for example a car can break and by the time the driver looks up it might be too late. There has been so many terrible car accidents, have killed kids, a mother, a father, a love one, and sometimes an entire family. When you get into a car accident and the cause of the accident was because you were distracted by your phone and you end up killing someone or causing them to go to the hospital the driver can end up in jail, because you shouldn't be on your phone when you are driving, If something is important and you need to be on your phone, you should pull over or park somewhere and then continue to drive, but you should never text in drive to put people's life in danger.

In conclusion, driving while texting should not be debatable because it is the most dangerous thing in the U.S. and its increasing and increasing every year and every day. That being teens of age 16 get in the most car accidents. There should be a law to prevent this, no one should lose a loved one because of a car accident involving the driver being distracted, because there could've been so many things done to prevent that. Losing control of a vehicle is so easy and dangerous when you get distracted by your phone. All accidents involving a driver being on their phone is totally preventable when you just leave it alone.   ",0,0.0072832205,0,True

Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home?

I believe, that it would be easy to do classes at home. Because you would be able to do them when you want to. For example if you had things to do or you have to clean the house and take care of your siblings you would be able to do you classes later with out stressing out. Like me i would prefer to take classes at home for that reason that i wouldn't have to be worrying about if I got my work done on time. Or you have to do does and that when you can just do it later.

Second, reason I think it would be easier to take classes at home because you wouldn't have to deal with people goofy around or people being so loud that you can't hear the teacher and you are trying to learn but you can't. Also there would be peace and quit, no one to bother you just you alone doing whatever you have to do. And I think you would get your work done faster. Therefore you would have more free time.

This is why I do think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home! Also it would stop teachers from talking to much. And having half of the class asleep.

I really think schools should let students have classes at home more because you could probably graduate early and get your diploma, start working and get money and do something with your life you never know.",0,0.00706413,0,True

411B31AD51C6,"Students and teachers tend to have quite a bit of differences. Students feel as If teachers just don't understand them, and I'm sure it's likewise for teachers as well. One of our biggest misunderstandings is summer reading projects. Summer for students is a time of bright sunny days, water parks, and going out for ice cream with friends. For teachers on the other hand, they view it as the time where students lose the eagerness to learn and information they've taught them. I believe that summer reading projects should be student-designed because It will persuade us students to continue learning and make summer reading projects much more enjoyable.

To begin, student-designed summer reading projects will better persuade us students to continue our learning over the break. Me being a student myself, I can vouch for not wanting to do the summer reading project for the simple fact that I feel as if teachers don't take into account that this is a break to enjoy ourselves during the summer. So, I would always wait till the last week of summer to rush and complete it. Almost every time resulting in my project being poorly done. Now If a student, like me, who better understands this were to design the project, I believe he or she would have a better approach because they'll work around this and seek a middle ground. Doing things such as extending the due date, decreasing the amount work required, or maybe even having students pick a book of their choice that they find interesting. Now I can understand how some people could say that having these projects be student-designed would just make the work easier; in which, negatively effecting it by shying away from the core purpose of the project, assuring students keep learning over break. I would have to disagree with this because not only would this enhance the learning capabilities within the project, but it would eliminate students fear of the thought of projects during summer break as a whole.

To further prove my point, student led summer reading projects could actually make doing it enjoyable and exciting. lets be honest, summer reading projects aren't fun in any sense. When students think of reading during the summer an instant look of disgust can be pictured upon their faces. They tend to strip away the thought of finally getting time to sit back and rest from the what seems like a never ending road of stress school brings. To give an example of the feeling it brings, say that you've come home from a long day at work and your totally exhausted. You finally start to approach your nice, comfortable bed then suddenly out of the blue, you get a telephone call saying they need you to come back in to work for a little longer. Imagine the amounts of frustration and sorrow that that would cause. I feel that this directly relates to students being forced to do summer reading projects that certainly isn't catered around their happiness. This can easily be avoided though by having these projects be student led because, like I stated before, students have a better understand of the feeling of students. So they'll take much better action when designing these projects making it more appealing to students. With doing things as simple as making the project eligible to be done as a group, or even having part of the project require you to do a fun summer activity. To combat this, someone may say that having the project include something enjoyable and interesting will cause students to feel as if they don't have to do it. I believe this to be immensely false, and I think that having the project attempt to strike students interest will have the total opposite effect; therefore, increasing the likelihood of students to do it.

To wrap this up, having summer reading projects be student-designed has many positives that greatly outshine the negatives. Teachers have for far too long designed these projects, and I think now is the time for a change. Rather than helping students continue their learning outside of school these projects causes students to neglect it even more. Even at having students design them I believe long strides will still be required to correctly revamp summer reading projects, but then I also believe that it is definitely a step in the right direction. ",0,0.0073187375,0,True

Is it hard for you to put your phone down while driving? Hopefully it isn't because there are so many things that could be prevented.

Most of the time, people who text and drive think they can do both things at once.

Previous studies have shown,""In the United States,3328 people were killed in motor vehicle crashes that involved distracted driving in 2012 alone..."". This shows that it's become very common which is absolutely wrong,your keeping you eyes off the road each time you glance over at your phone. As we know, anything could happen during that time you kept your eyes off for a few seconds.

Also a main reason why you shouldn't operate both things at once, is simply because it's illegal in some states. You don't want to be paying a fine much less do jail time. It's definitely not worth you being on your phone. And most definitely not worth your life or the life of others. For example,""A Minnesota woman sent and received 240 texts while driving one morning, before hitting and killing a motorcyclist on a highway exit ramp. she was acquitted of felony criminal vehicular homicide and instead convicted of careless driving,which carries a penalty of a month in jail and $50,000 in restitution"". It's very common for officers to check how long ago you were on your phone before the accident to see if that was what lead to it.

These accidents could be easily avoided, considering the fact that companies have built bluetooth in cars so that if you get a call you can pick up through the car. Or as plain and simple as it sounds just don't pick up the phone at all.

84D2A6C75C67,"Talking to more than one person for ideas or advice is very helpful for many reasons. It may help you understand different sides of an argument for example. Or you may even get more, or different information from different people. Everybody thinks differently, and the more people you question on a subject the more unique answers or ideas you would get. That is why I would think talking to more people for advice or for any subject, is better than only talking to one person, or no one at all.

A big reason I personally, and from experience think getting more opinions on is when you get into an argument. Not all arguments are about settling an aggravated dispute. Some arguments begin by at least one person disagreeing with another persons idea. This is not a bad thing. If you were in an argument and you thought you were right about something, ask a friend or somebody what they think. They may prove your side of the story, or they may even change your mind and explain why you were wrong. Doing this can be a good way to understand whole different sides of stories that you may not have even considered.

Another reason for talking to a lot of people for something is to get ideas. Businesses do this all the time to invent new products. A bunch of people may get together and decide they wanted to make a new brand of car. Instead of one person thinking about the idea, everybody in the business may suggest something like what to call the car,how wide the car should be,how many they should make, or where they should sell the new car. The more brains and perspectives you have, the more you can accomplish.

The final reason to ask people for their opinions is to gain information or techniques. If you were trying to grow a garden and all of your plants were dying, it would be smart to ask a farmer what to do. Or even go online and look up the reason all of your plants were dying. You could even find out that you were watering your plants to much, or that the plant you were trying to grow needed shade. Even learning techniques from another person would be an excellent idea. If you need help with something there is also people around to question or get information from.

If you put everything together, asking people for help or for advice is a very good option. It can help you in so many ways, such as being in a business or growing a garden. As a plus their is not a lot of downsides to asking for help. This will help you settle arguments or gain information.                                    ",0,0.006528407,0,True

Viking 1 photograph of the Face on Mars was taken in 1976. The camera's absolute maximum was 43 meters per pixel. By looking at the photograph, you wouldn't be able to make a definate conclusion about what exactly the figure was and how it got on the surface of Mars.

Later, on April 8, 2001, Mars Global Surveyor was able to capture a photograph with an absolute maximum of 1.56 meters instead of 43 meters per pixel like in the 1976 Viking photo.

1780720a,"""The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.""1 This process where a selection of electors meet and vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes in Congress is a way of election that has been in the roots of this great and prosperous country since its beginning. Is this way of electing really all that fair? Does it let the entire population get a fair say in who thay want to run the country? While some people may argue that this system allows the people on the commity of electors that actually want to have their fair say in who becomes president, but first you need to think about they whole american population barely has any say at all in the election and we change this tradition.

It is time for a change, because when a United States citizen votes, they actually arent even voting for president at all. They are mearly voting for a commity of electors to elect the next president for them. Also, is the the commity of electors that actaully wins the elections, and not the popular vote. This is why they call this commity of electors the swing vote because you could win the popular vote by 78.9 percent and still lose the election because you lost the commity of electors votes. This senerio has happened a few times in our history. For instance in 2000 candidate Al Gore won there popluar vote but lost the presidency thanks to the commity of electons from the electoral college. Some people may argue that this is a long tradtion in our country and must be kept. Yes this is true, but there are some very crusial factors against this.

It does not include and take into count the whole population and it can lead some canadits to lose even when the whole country voted for them. So we need to do something about this process of election. We must find a new way that included and takes into count the population of the United States. Not just a commity of electors.

The Elector College has been is the building blocks of this country since its beginning, but because of some of it's flaws it must be changed. This process does not include the entire count of the votes by american citizens. It is like our thoughts and ideas of who should be president do not even matter in the votting process. The Electoral College may be a deep tradition in our country since its beginning, it must be changed if our great nation is going to be able to prosper and grow.",0,0.0068941712,0,True
1EFAC87220DC,"Summer is a time of relaxation, fun, and time to spend with family and friends. Summer can also be a time for a great off season for sports and a time to get better at your crafts. Many parents and teachers believe that the summer should be a time to really work on your mistakes or bad habits you've made over the school year. Whether its studying a subject, practicing a sport, or even working on your behavior. Over the summer some schools assign projects for students to do. I believe that summer projects should be student-designed, but teacher's must approve their work.

If students were able to design their own summer projects then they would be able to truly use their unique creativity. Students would have the ability to choose a project idea that they like and not some boring project that a teacher may choose. Also more and more students would actually do their projects because they would choose an idea that would be enjoyable. Teachers shouldn't judge your based on the work that they give you, but on the ideas that you come up with. I think more teachers should allow kids to use their own creativity instead of making students into robots and giving them instructions that they must follow.

In today's society, managers don't hire people based on their high school grades, but on their creativity and their great ideas that they could bring to the table. If you want to become a manager of a company or even an entrepreneur, you must have great ideas. You must also be able to use your own creativity to persuade people to join your company or buy your products. Your teacher isn't going to just come up with your ideas when you get older, so why should they now. The younger you are at learning how to come up with your own ideas and how to be more creative, the more you're going to flourish as you get older.

Some may say that teacher-designed summer projects would be better because it may be harder and challenge the students more. Also teacher-designed projects may relate to school more and what they might learn in the future because many teachers have a lot of experience. Student's may also have a hard time coming up with their own ideas and could take longer. But this is why I think students should come up with their own project designs and then have the teachers check their idea before they start working, so that their project isn't too easy or short. Student's would also have to use their brain more and will teach them that they will struggle later in life because creating your own ideas aren't easy. This will better prepare them in the future and will allow them to truly show/express their creativity to the rest of society.

In the future, our society isn't going to change based on what students get on their exams, but on the ideas that they come up with. Our ideas will truly affect the belief's of our society. This is why I think teacher's should allow students to come up with their own project designs so that they will learn how to use their creativity in order to benefit themselves, but more importantly, how to benefit others. I've already seen so many younger people use their ideas to better help our environments and create less pollution in the homes of animals. I think our world can continue to improve and become a better place by the ideas that we come up using our creativity. ",0,0.0070582624,0,True
4EF56F42107E,"People sometimes talk to multiple people when seeking for an advice. If we only ask one person, then that person might not be correct. People tend to trust the most when they ask for more than one person's advice. And also, if we ask multiple people for an advice, we can see what their viewpoints are and what they would do in different situations. When asking for an advice, it is more efficient to ask multiple people to ensure if what one person said was accurate, it gives us a variety options to choose from, and we can combine some advises to form a better one.

The first reason in which asking more than one person for an advice is better is to ensure that if what one person said is accurate or not. If you are not sure of what one person said as an advice, you can ask other people to check if what they said was true. For example, if you ask a friend on how to handle a problem and you think that what they said wasn't accurate or good enough, then you can ask someone else for more credibility. If you do not ask more people, then you might get the wrong advice. The solution you think is correct will actually be inaccurate and instead of making things better, you can make them much worse. You can ask different kinds of people of different ages to see what most people think. You can't do that if you only ask one person or just ask the same type of people.

Another reason that it is better to ask more than one person for an opinion or advice is that it gives us a variety of options to choose from. If we only stick to an advice that one person gave us, then we will only have to take that advice, not knowing if it was accurate or not. Having only one option to choose from can sometimes be better for indecisive people, but it is better to have more options to choose from most of the time. Having more than one option is better because you have the control over the situation. If you ask one person you will have to take that advice without knowing what other great options are out there. Finally, if you have more options to choose from, you can imagine the outcome of each of those options and see which one is the best one. Plus, it is sometimes fun to try new things that have a different outcome.

The last reason in which multiple opinions are better is because you can combine some advises to form a better one. If two people say different things and both of them make sense, then maybe you can combine them to make the better choice. This also helps you with your creativity of combining things to get a better outcome. Combining advises is the best option for indecisive people. Instead of choosing between two options, they can just do both but combined. If someone gives you an advice that you would never take, but it looks like a good advice, then you should combine both. It is never bad to take positive risks, you should try something new everyday.

In conclusion, it is more efficient to ask multiple people for an advice to make sure if what one person said was true or not, you can have a variety options to choose from, and you can combine some advises to form a better one. If you ask multiple people for an advice, then they can encourage you take an action that you never took before. You should also combine advises because two brains are better than one. Different kinds of people's viewpoints can be better to try something new or just to have different perspectives with different options. When asking for an advice, you should always ask multiple people for their opinion.",0,0.01846145,0,True
AA6CE053DB9A,"An extracurricular activity is something that only a few students take part in, but if every student had to join an activity, they would all have somewhere they want to be, and be doing something they enjoy, instead of going home right away and not having the fun a young person should be having. Extracurricular activities are a way for students to enjoy learning, learn in a non-stressful environment, and have fun while doing it. I agree with the decision that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, because it gives students an opportunity to learn new things and meet others who might have the same interests, have something fun to do after the school day, and become part of a group.

Making extracurricular activities mandatory can give students opportunities to learn new skills, and meet others who could share the same interests. Students who join an extracurricular activity they enjoy, would have an opportunity to explore new ways to do things and learn from the other members of that club, committee, or group. If students had to join extracurricular activities, they would be able to make friends and spend time with them each meeting, therefore getting to know them well, feel comfortable talking to them and becoming very good friends. In addition, joining an extracurricular activity is a great way for students to learn the necessary skills that are needed for that specific activity, in case they would want to pursue a career in that area. For example, if a student were to join the student council or debate team, they might have an interest in one day becoming a politician or a lawyer. In conclusion, extracurricular activities are a good way for students to make friends and learn new things that could lead up to a possible career.

Students who must participate in at least one extracurricular activity have something fun to do after the long school day. After school ends, many students must go home to do their homework and help out at home, but making them join an extracurricular activity can let them relax from a stressful day at school, and give them something fun to do that could help them forget the worries of schoolwork and upcoming assessments. From my own experiences, I have enjoyed having something to do and somewhere to go after-school instead of going home and doing homework. I used to play violin in the Generic_Name Youth Orchestra where I enjoyed going to every rehearsal and concert, because it gave me something else to think about, I got to be a part of an amazing ""family"", and have fun especially after a long day at home or school. In all, having something fun to do after-school, can ease the pressure from school away, allowing students to also enjoy life instead of being under constant stress and pressure from school, classmates, and family issues.

Mandatory extracurricular activities can make students feel ""at home"", in a particular group. Some students don't always feel like they fit in, and by making them join an extracurricular activity, they could find a place where they are free to open up, talk, and make friends. Having a place where students can be themselves, can give students a boost in self-confidence and morale, which can lead them to be more willing to participate at school and help out at home. Sometimes in life we are confronted by situations and people who can make you feel insignificant and lost, so if students who feel that way were to join an activity they enjoy, it could help them escape from that scary place even if it's just for a little while and help them smile. In conclusion, if all students participated in extracurricular activities, they could feel comfortable for at least some time, before they go back to their daily lives of schoolwork, homework, tests, and family business.

Making extracurricular activities mandatory for all students, is an excellent way for them to get to know each other, learn skills that they could use in the future, whether it's for a career or just for leisure, get to do something they enjoy doing after a long day at school, and give students a chance to express themselves without fear of being left out and ignored. By making every student participate in an extracurricular activity, we can ensure that every student has a place where they will feel protected and have their ideas heard.",0,0.006765668,0,True
2FC7CD39C375,"A nice, long, and warm summer break is what many students consider the best boon of public schools. While public schools respect the break that is given to the students, they intend to make certain that every student maintains an adequate level of mental preparedness while on their break. To achieve this goal a majority, if not the entirety, of public school teachers hand out summer projects or summer assignments. These aforementioned summer assignments and summer projects should be created and designed solely by teachers; not only to ensure quality, but to simultaneously maintain the standards of learning required by the teachers.

Teacher, and only teachers, understand how they are going to administer each individual course. Therefore teachers should be the ones who decide what each assignment should be. If that stands true for everyday assignments, what changes that for summer assignments? My current Pre-Calculus AB teacher assigned her soon-to-be students a summer assignment consisting of a majority of trigonometry problems. Most complained that, ""Should not we be focusing on algebra problems"". To our bewilderment Pre-Calculus AB did contain a fair bit of algebra, though my teacher exclaimed, ""I'm more than aware that all of my incoming students are comfortable with algebra problems. I expect that of them. However this course requires both algebra and trigonometry which is why i make sure that all my students hone their trigonometry skills over the summer"". As just demonstrated, a student is incapable of making the right judgment calls on assignment because they lack the foresight of knowing what will be taught through the entire course. Only a teacher knows what they will teach which is why they make the assignments, not the students.

However, many students contend that only a student truly knows how they themselves learns the best. This argument however fails to realize that it is a part of each county's, administrator's, and teacher's job to understand every attendee of their school and this understand is what makes counties, administrators, and teachers the best candidates to dictate what students should be working on over the summer. As the son of a high school English teacher, i sit in on many conversations and phone calls between her and another teacher that are entirely dedicated to helping a student do better in school. Those are the actions that many students never get to see their teachers take a part in. Various counties and school administrators cooperate to put computers and tablets put in every school because they understand there are a vast amount of visual learners that struggle to retain knowledge given though lectures. Counties are also tackling issues such as bright lights inhibiting academic performance and how school times affect the academic ability of their students. This helps to prove the point that students are understood at every level of authority in public schools. That very understanding ,that many students fail to witness, is what makes a teacher the prime candidate to create a summer assignment.

Lastly, an assignment of such significance needs to be carefully and meticulously crafted. Not only do students lack the knowledge of what to put on an assignment, they lack the necessary skills required to make an effective assignment. Evidenced by students lack of a degree in education. This gap in skill was shown to me when my English teacher assigned a project to make our own lesson. A lesson which was to made by groups of five and teach the rest of the class about one section of A.C.E.S., a format for writing essays. Every lesson was ill prepared, unfocused, and poorly constructed. Not for lack of effort, but because we simply did not have the proper training. No such student missing so much skill should be designated to make an assignment of so much importance, only a teacher that has the proper training and vision for the assignment being made.

A summer assignment differs from no other common assignment other than when the assignment should be completed. Like any other assignment, a summer assignment should be handled by a teacher to facilitate the assignments quality.",0,0.0077942903,0,True

204C6B729D8B,"In various educational systems across the country, students are required to complete summer projects that help them retain infromation they would have most likely forgotten if not for these projects. Not only this but it is an efficient way introduce new concepts students will likely see in the forecoming school year. This idea is of sound measure. Students are said to forget a significant amount of material they learned in school in just the few months they are out on break. But how can teachers really maximize their students' fullest potential? What can they do to assure that the students are learning in the most befitting way possible? The answer lies not in them but in their students. As teachers begin to conjure certain summer assignments, they should look to reach out to thier students for advice. Having student-designed summer projects should be used in lue of teacher-designed summer projects because it creates a learning enviroment that is not only efficient but specifically designed to maximize potential.

During the summer, the last thing that a student wants on their mind is to complete a summer assignment. And who can blame them? It is most likely not in anyones best interest to want to sit inside a house where work is waiting for them. However, if teachers can somehow make their assignments more interesting and incite active engadgemnt, then students can have the value of imrproving their cerebral capabilities in an enjoyable learning enviroment. There are numerous ways a teacher can get their student's input on a summer assignemnt. They can have a digital survey, one of the most commonly used tools to get basic information on a topic. This is a helpful strategy when just looking to improve the quality of an assignemnt, or get a taste of what might be expected. This strategy, however, is still very teacher oriented and lacks student control. If this is to broad and/or unfufilling, then teachers can avert to another method such as student drafts. This is where a student can individually submit a draft of a summer project by outlining their opinions and suggestions that may benefit all students. Here, a teacher can observe first hand what a student would see most appropriate for a summer assignemnt. This is still a very subjective method of student input; while the goal is to assure that all students are learning during the break, this particular student may not be speaking for everyone else. In other words, a poll may predict the general concensus of a majority but it still can be inaccurate and non-representative. Another, more objective strategy a teacher can use is what is called a class concensus. Here, the class (or any student body) organizes thier ideas together, to come to a final or multiple conclusions. This is not the most practical way but it is non-biased and very effective in a factor analysis situtation. This method is the most effective way to implement a student-designed summer project in the absence of bias and non-representation.

Teacher-designed summer projects can be counterintutive, as they fail to not only improve the compulsive tendencies prominent in these projects, but also lack incentives to promote active engadgment. In other words, the only way a student can activley learn is to provide a setting where they want to learn. To reinforce a point made earlier, it is summer time. No student will bow down and work for the sake of working; they need to be molded and guided into a mindset where they can put time aside to want to engadge in a summer assignemnt. While a student-designed summer project is the most effective way to assure continuous learning throughout the summer, it is ultimatley the teacher's job to be the enforcer, the head hunter. Students can be heavily influenced by the actions and tendencies of thier teachers. By what they do, what they say, how they talk to people, and so on and so forth. There is no absolute way to teach and in fact there is no absolute way to do anything. This very fact alone demonstrates the importance of teachers' ability to shape thier students into fine men and women through their methodology. Just as it is important to base educational strategies on the strengths of the students in the classroom, it is equally important to have that same impact outside of school through summer assignemnts and projects.                                                  ",0,0.006548316,0,True

FD65FEAAB0BC,"Yes, many people do think that the ""Face on Mars"" was a monument created by aliens, possibly creating a sign of some sort. However, this is not true. What you think is the ""face"" is actually a natural landform. This natural landform may appear to look like a face, but why?

The landform looks like a face becuase of the shadows that hit the landform in certain areas. ""... this... had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh (2)."" It makes it look somewhat like a face. ""...a huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth (3)."" Another reason why the landform looks like a face is becuase our eyes, that play tricks on us, may make it seem real that it is a face. Such as illusion that make it appear that the landform looks like a face that is staring up at the camera on Mars. Many poeple, however will still ask for more evidence that the landform is not alien artifact.

""...Mars Oribiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the origional... photos... when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform.

They don't just pop up out of nowhere. They have been seen before. It's not like it is a first thing that scientists are just discovering.

C79292B5F78A,"My thoughts on this are that it is good time and this should actually occur for many reasons first of all during the weekdays young people have school everyday only if it is a holiday or if sick. By implying this more young people will get out of the streets so late at night there is no need to be out so late at night in the first place. Second of all, at 10 p. m is a great time to be home during the weekdays it will keep you out of trouble and there will be less chances of young people dying to other criminals at night. Late at night is where most of all crimes occur and now the chances of this will be lower. Third of all , as their are so many people that sell drugs and if young people have to be home so early the chance of them getting into all types of drugs will be so much lower.

If this does become a law the times are also very appropriate Monday through Friday until 10 p. m and then Saturday through Sunday until 12 p. m no one needs to be on the streets later then this time that is being given. If they are their out so late there should be a extreme reason as to why they would be ""breaking the law"". This will most likely keep young people out of more troubles then they all ready are. This time is not unfair it is a very generous time to be home. This really should not be interfering with any ones life you can still go out but not be out for so late at night. I would understand if this law was also for people over the age of 18 because young adults like to party. But this law should actually be for people under the age of 18 that would make more sense and being a ""adult""(over the age of 18) they know what is right from wrong,what they should be doing, and what they should not be doing.

This law is not to harm anyone but it would to improve the community curfews to keep teenagers out of trouble I can very much agree with that. But those young teenagers are not doing the right thing then no matter what law that is added nothing will change the fact of how they act(keep them out of trouble). Going back to the time it is not like this law will be implying that the young people do not hang out with their friends this is just so more people can stay safe from all the trouble that is the streets. A lot of innocent people die every year by being so late at night and in the streets where some of the bad people come out. They have all after school to be doing after school activities this will not keep anyone from doing what they want. It is just a way to keep young people out of trouble there should be excuses to all of this like going to a party but there as well should be a limit to all of this. The consequence if they break the law should start of as a warning and then just be adding on to that.

My position on this curfew law is also that I would understand why people do not want this to happen but at the same time teenagers do know what they should be doing and what they should not be doing. I have two different view points why they should be worried and why they should not be worried. I know that people like to have sleep overs and would this be included or do they have to specifically in their house on can they be sleeping at someone else . Back into my other view if they go to a party lets say over the weekend where the curfew is at 12 p. m because it is on a Saturday and they come back at 1 p. m or later .They are not keeping track of time and lose the time. They are having fun with all of their friends and then they get caught because someone calls the police. Then the police comes and now they have to face the law and all that. Now what is next that being on their record just because they stayed out longer then they had and were on the streets. This would honestly suck and then going home and getting in trouble by your parent because of a mistake you made. After all this wanting to go to a very good college and they not accepting them just because they made a mistake for staying to late at the party. This would be a down side because if anyone breaks the law that will go on there record and not come out of there permit sadly this is a consequence that can happen and would suck. A college not accepting them because they "" broke the law"" not fun at all because colleges do look at everything anyone does before getting accepted and being a very good student with a high GPA and hearing this would not be good they will be carrying that guilt for their whole life by not getting into the college that they want to get into.

On the other note right now there is not a curfew to what time teenagers should be home yet but there is a curfew to when who ever has their permit for driving. So that is also a big restriction no young teenager is out in their car at a late time the only time you can actually see them is when they are getting out of school. There are pros and cons to this ""law"" but I think there are mostly pros then cons everything is very much reasonable and understanding. The only down/con that I can personally thin of right now is that they get caught and that going in their record does not sound good at all. But overall there are a lot of pros to this and this law should be seriously implied to all of the United States not only to one city but to all of them. This will keep more people safe yes pf course there is always that one person who wants to break the law as a joke or something that really should not be anything to play around with or anything but something that all young people listen to it take it serious.

In conclusion this law or curfew will stop all of these thieves from stealing young girls or boys and then selling them as well as to stop rape from happening so much because sometime it is very hard to detected people because of how dark it is. But this will most likely lower the chance of all these negative things to happen so frequently to anyone. It will also keep young people out of lots of trouble by being so late at night less danger.",0,0.0067656063,0,True
0646B208EF8E,"The future is in the present. What seemed like a mere dreaming is now coming to life! New techology has helped with many advances today, for example smart cars. This concept is fairly new, but it has already sprouted problems. These dilemmas are complex; therefore, the world is still not ready for driverless cars.

Throughout the years many companies have tried to make this new idea happen, yet it is a new concept. ""For example, in the late 1950s, General Motors created a concept car that could run on a special test track. ... These smart-road systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical."" This shows that driverless cars are not a smart idea. Now a days people want something pratical and fast: smart-road systems are niether pratical or quick, because it would be expensive and it would take time for the roads to be upgraded. Once they saw the expensives it would take, they let go of the idea. After this idea of smart-roads epicly failed, other came up with the idea of smart cars.

Even though smart cars have been effective, they are still not able to drive themselves. ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents,"" smart cars have programs to assists the driver,not to drive themselves. Humans will still have to be alert on the road, so it will not going to help the driver. What is the use of cars that can drive themselves, if when the driving conditions get tough humans will be needed?

Another important issue (if these driverless cars come out), is who will be to blame for if an accident happens- the ""driver""

or the company? Because the person in the car will be assisting the car, the car should be to blame for. Since the smart cars are made to drive themselves, then all people involved in the accident would be victims.

Due to the information, it is safe to say that driveless cars are yet to be imereged into today's life. The people of today spend most of their day doing something, in my opinion they are ready to do nothing. Is one going to enjoy this break, though- maybe not, becasue though they are just passagers the car might need assists? Therefore there is no need for cars that will get only part of the job done.

When we ask questions like ""Can we actually 'calculate' emotions like we calculate math problems? or ""How can a simple computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans have to use and show how we feel? shows that we humans need this type of cool technology in the future to make things easier than what they are nowadays!",0,0.006474802,0,True
84956A4FA804,"Driverless cars are a thing of the future. Maybe even the near future. Since 2009, certain people have been testing driverless cars. Except, they aren't quite there yet. The cars still require human assitstance in difficult situations that the driver can't handle. But is it a good idea? Can we rely on computers to do something that can be dangerous? The answer is no.

Humans have faults. So do computers. A computers doesn't have the traits it needs to be able to drive someone. Not to mention, the whole process of making an almost driverless car is expensive. There simply isn't enough money to manufacter that many cars to drag people around.

Another issue is the driving itself. The cars they are testing today do not have certain abilities that humans do, such as parking, driving in difficult traffic, or going around accidents. Of curse they have sensors to alert the driver. But how alert will they be? A car can drive itself for most of the time, so why pay attention? It could be very dangerous if the human at the wheel isn't alert. Accidents will be prone to happen, and there may even be more accidents than we have now.

A present problem that is also important is traffic law. Trafic laws are written to make the assumption that a safe human driver is in control at all times and is keeping themselves and the pasengers safe. Places such as California, Nevada, florida, and the District of Colombia even outlawed the testing of computer driven cars. This proves as a giant red flag of if we should have computer driven cars or not. The manufacturers assume the laws will be changed in the future. But if there is an accident, is the driver or creator of fault? The creator of course. There's no doubt that in advertising the car, the manufacturers promised safety and reliability. But that didn't happen, and the driver wasn't at fault. It was the computer for not doing what it was supposed to do.

In conclusion, driverless cars controlled by computers is a bad idea. It is expensive, dangerous, unreliable, and shouldn't be tested for.       ",0,0.007336587,0,True

In today's day in age drivers range from the age of 15 to 70 and older so there is indeed a large range of different drivers with different experiences and different skills behind the wheel. Many people take pride in their ability to multitask while driving like being able to seamlessly merge into ongoing traffic with one hand while trying to calm down their crying child in the back. But a common boast upon many people is their ability to use their phone while driving and not being fazed or seeing it as a distraction since they think it is not that much of a danger to them or anyone around them. This is a very bad trait as distracted driving is the number one cause of car related accidents in America with reckless driving coming in second which can also happen when drivers use their phone as it can lead to them losing focus and driving recklessly. Reasons like this is why most cars don't have dvd players in the front seat for the passengers side as it can be a distraction to the driver. Driving while being on a phone is also illegal in some states like Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, and Illinois with a fine of $50,00 and up to 1 year in prison. The main reasons why drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle is because you are more likely to crash and you put others at risk.

The first reason why drivers should not be able to use their cell phone while operating a vehicle is because you are more likely to crash. It's been documented that 19% of drivers of all ages admit to surfing the web while driving. In a blog post by Napoli Shkolnik PLLC it states,""This one is pretty obvious, but did you know that you are 23 times more likely to crash if you text and drive? According to the National Safety Council, 1.6 million car crashes due to texting while driving happen each year. If you don't want to crash your car and get injured or even killed, don't text and drive."" These statistics show just how dangerous texting and driving is and why people shouldn't overlook this issue as it is a national problem that doesn't get published enough. Most people like to ignore the problem of texting while driving as they might have grown up with older figures who do the same. A good point can be found from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia where they have an article that states,""Cell phone use while driving statistics and texting and driving facts show that this behavior is common and dangerous for teen drivers. In 2017 according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 3,166 people were killed in 2,935 distraction-affected crashes, accounting for 9 percent of all fatal crashes in the United States. Knowing cell phone use while driving statistics and texting and driving facts may help families manage this dangerous risk. Texting while driving and other cell phone use while driving facts and statistics show that this multitasking behind the wheel is becoming a life-threatening norm. Talking or texting while driving or checking or sending social media posts takes eyes and brains off the task of driving. Coupled with inexperience and lack of driving skills, cell phone use can be especially deadly for teen drivers."" This article shows that teens especially need to be more mindful when it comes to what they do in their vehicle since they are so young and easily persuaded that might think it's okay to use their phone if their friend is calling or if they want to record something while driving even though it's never safe. It also shows how since most teens just start off driving they are inexperienced and don't know how to multitask. A car crash is one of the most traumatizing things to happen to a person with many surviving vitamins gaining PTSD from the experience. With that being said using your phone while multitasking in the car could result in a car crash.

The second reason why drivers should not be able to use their cell phone while operating a vehicle is because you are more likely to crash and you put others at risk. Many people use their phones while driving when they're with their friends or family as they might feel comfortable enough to do so or feel they are skilled enough to do so..In another blog post by Napoli Shkolnik PLLC it says,""Not only does texting and driving put your own life at risk, but it also gravely endangers the lives of other people around you. As a driver, you are responsible not only for the passengers in your car, but also for other motorists on the road, not to mention pedestrians who often end up hurt or killed because of the negligence of drivers. Speaking of pedestrians, you know how kids can pop up seemingly out of nowhere and get on the road? Well, you are much less likely to notice them while looking at the phone in your lap."" This piece of commentary on the issue greatly embodies how other people's wrongdoing might affect anybody caught in the crosshairs like a child crossing the street. It also provides commentary on how much you value the people in your car if you're willing to put them in such grave danger in that case. Another good point can be found from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia where they have an article that says,""Because technology will change and new distractions will be introduced, parents need to make sure teens understand the value of engaged driving, where the driver is continuously attentive and focused. Make a family commitment not to use distracting devices while driving. According to research conducted at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), teens who do not frequently use a phone while driving believe the benefits of putting away their phone while driving outweigh any drawbacks."" This article makes great use of the theme of technology with how it can affect someone's mindset. It also shows how parents need to educate their kids to be better drivers. Putting their friends at risk and potentially harming them is something that nobody wants to do. Which is another reason why people must stop using their phones while driving.

In conclusion the main reasons why drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle is because you are more likely to crash and you put others at risk. Drivers should stop trying to multitask everything and do everything at once and just pay attention to the road. The road is shared by everybody so when one selfish person decides to not pay attention and drive around clueless then everyone else suffers. Although it would be considerably easier to pull over and use your phone while parked many people go out of their way to still put many lives in danger because of the inconvenience. Consequences getting caught driving while being on your phone also include spikes in insurance rates as companies will charge you higher premiums. Bragging about being reckless on the road should be condemned and not boasted all multitasking while driving by using your phone only shows impatience and immaturity. Texting and driving has cause six times more deaths than drunk driving yet people still shrug it off due to them thinking they can manage to keep their attention in two places at once. Hopefully beginner drivers are taught to take their time on the road and not to be in a rush to respond to a notification immediately and wait and do it when the time is right.

This shows that the author supports this idea because he finds it interesting that Venus could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth.

Another reason why the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents would be that in the last passage it states, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained onthe planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.

F82207B7F26C,"There has been theories and plans for driverless cars for the future. Scientists have been researching for many years trying to find a way where cars drive themselves. That day has finally came, to a certain extent. These ""driverless"" cars still need the assistance of humans. So these cars cannot fully drive themselves. The new technology that people are putting into cars, just does not seem like a very well thought out idea. Anything could happen to these driverless cars. In my eyes, and probaly many other eyes, there should not be such a thing where cars drive themselves.

Like I said before, ""anything can happen to these driverless cars."" Well, that is true. For instance, there could be a malfunction somewhere in the technology when a person is driving on the instertate. And potentially harm that person or many other people. These cars have sensors all around them, they also have dubbed LIDAR to see a 3D image of everything that is happening and sense when they are close to an object or not. What if some of those sensors broke, or something happened to the sensors where they could not detect anything. That person could possibly get injured really bad. Or even put other people at state. Driverless cars can be very dangerous to people and their surroundings. Another problem with these cars is who will be liable if there happened to be an accident? Would it be the driver or the manufacturer? That is one thing that has yet to be determined.

There has been multiple different design plans for these driverless cars. Some of them involved putting dubbed LIDAR and sensors all around and in the car. Others have involved running electrical cables through roads that sent radio signals to a receiver on the front end of the car. Just all sorts of different ideas. But how are people going to pay for these driverless cars. How are scientists going to provide the cost for these cars and run electrical cables through every single road. It is going to be outrageous to construct all of those ideas. Nobody in the right mind is going to want to pay for a car that only drives itself at certain aspects and that cannot guarantee their safety when driving.

Many thoughts and ideas about these driverless cars are genius. Who would not want a car that could drive itself? These cars can steer, accelerate, and brake themseleves. Driving the car still needs human access, but not like it would if these cars could do these things. Driverless cars could change the world as we know it. But there are certain restrictions that need to be solved first.

These driverless cars can be help to some. Could be harm to others. Anything could happen to the car that could potentially harm that person or other people. The liability factor of the car is a big risk. If the car malfunctions, it would be the drivers fault? Nobody wants to deal with that. There are so many cons to this idea of self driving cars. Until scientists or somebody figures out how to make those problems less dangerous, or more reliable. People are not going to think that driverless cars will start to change the world.                                 ",0,0.00722766,0,True

Should people be able to use a cellular device while operating a vehicle? Different generations would agree and disagree. Older generation would say ""No, drivers should not be able to use a phone while driving."" While newer generation would say ""Yes, drivers should be able to use a phone while driving."" I believe that drivers should not be able to use a cellular device while operating a vehicle.

Statistics state that 26% of all crashes in 2014 involved cell phone use. 10% of those crashes are teen drivers of the age 15 to 19. Teens are more likely to text and drive because their world is revolved around social media. Because teenagers are young and naïve we believe that we are more capable of multitasking but, history has shown otherwise.

Some people think they are invincible and can't be killed. So, they think can text and drive and not get hurt or face the consequences. People as they get older think they can get away with more stuff like texting and driving, but life hits them with a wake-up call.

In conclusion, do you think drivers should be able to use their cell phone while driving? People need to keep their eyes on the road and on nothing else.

I think you should put Policy 1 because no one is really bothering other people with their phones. Its the students responsibility if they loose their phone or if someone steals it. In addition, it depends on the student if they want to take advantage of their education or not. They are the ones who choose their future. So if their phone is a distraction for them for their education, then they should do something about it. During lunch periods, its all about free time from school, so they should use their phones. Also, if you put Policy 2, students would have to use them in case of an emergency. Furthermore, if you put Policy 1, then the students won't have to ""want"" to take their phones out during class because they can take their phones out during lunch periods and other free times. In simpler terms, the students would turn off their phones during class because they can use them in their free time during school.

I don't think its right to require all students to perform community service. Some students live in dangerous areas where its unsafe to go outside. Others may not be able to work due to how late their parents get back from work or it may interfere with doing homework. Some students won't do any work because their's no incentive to work other than you telling them to.

You should take safety as a big reason not to require students doing work for community. In the day and age we live in there are too many things that could harm somebody.

There are sexual predators, gangs, serial killers, and kidnappers. If a student is in a gang and is out doing a group community project and a rival gang member sees that student everybody else could be in danger of a drive by shooting and multiple people could be seriously injured or even killed. With the numbers of gangs rising in the U.S. there's no telling who could be in a gang or not. Sexual predators is also a major concern. When you have a couple of teenagers on the side of the road cleaning it would be easy to kidnap someone and rive off.

Another reason why you shouldn't require students to work is because some parents don't get home till really late at night. Usually by the time my mom and step dad get home its already dark outside and to late to do anything. Working after school would be the main time students would have to work and after school is when students are doing their homework. Even if your doing your community a good thing having students grades drop doesn't look good on the school.

I know a lot of kids who wouldn't work even if they were forced to. If all you do is simply tell all the students they have to do community service then very few people will want to work. Even if you bring in rewards for working some kids would say, "" Woo a bike! My birthday is in a month I can wait."" On top of not wanting to work they have leadership classes that are solely based on doing good things for the community for those who want to.

All of these reasons are why you shouldn't require students to do community service.

Some examples of these are, how close Venus is from the sun and how it is very similar to Earth. Also Venus may have had forms of life on it. The author gives examples for each one of these claims and how they would give a positive effect. These are just a few reasons we should explore Venus and figure out more about it.

The first reason to learn more about Venus is how close it is from the sun. One example for this is when the text states,""Venus is the second planet from our sun."" Which means that it is not very far away from earth. Another reason to study Venus is how similar it is to earth. An example for this is when the text states,""Venus is the closest planet to the Earth in terms of density and size."" A final reason is that Venus may of had forms of life on it. Evidence for this statement is shown when the text states,""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" This statement shows how Venus could have been very, very similar to earth.

In conclusion the reasons for exploring Venus include how close it is to the sun, how similar it is to Earth, and how it could have supported life forms long ago.

He is totally wrong because to be yourself in a world and make the greatest accomplishment in your life, the wold do not have to take control over you liberty, you should take control over the world to accomplish whats you are going to be. Author Ralph Waldo Emerson did not think before writing these letter because to be yourself in a world, you should have to make your own decisions, do something that you would like to do, and being your self not letting the world to take control over your life.

First thing,

be yourself and never give the right to the world. To make that happen you should have to make your own decisions, because if you let the world to choose for you in the future you may get lost and tire about your life, because you let the world to take control over your life, and for not choosing your own decision. Being your self and not letting the world to try to make something else, is something that will bring goods in your future, because is something that you choose and you know why did you took it and why did you choose it. However, the peoples that let the wold to choose for them they will get tire about life.

The second thing for accomplishment; and not letting the world to control you,is being your self and do what you like to do, never letting the world to do whatever it wants to do with you. If you want to do the greatest accomplishment in your life you should take something that you that you like to do. because when you do something that you like to do you will never going to get tire about doing it, when you like to do something and you wanted to be the greatest accomplishment, you are not going to feel that job like a job because is something that you like to do. But to make that happen and accomplish that dream. never led the world to do what ever it wants with you.

As far as what is explained in this article the only benefit to this technology is that computers will know what you are feeling, and the question that needs to be asked is; do we really want them to? Secondly, there was no mention of how much this kind of technology costs or if it would even be plausible for it to be in a classroom setting. Lastly, why is it be necessary for a computer to overtake yet another aspect of a teacher's job of human interaction and communication. Technology being able to read emotional expressions in the classroom sounds wildly ludicrous in terms of use, cost, and personal connections

Although all seems harmless on the forefront of this idea, the side effects could turn very sour very quick. Nick D' Alto says ""Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad."" The author of this article talks of how it will improve ad placements by whether you smile or frown, however I know for a fact social medias, especially Facebook, are already basing information on preferable ads by just what material you look at. Why is it necessary for a program to constantly scan our face just to see if we like something or not? This gives the computer so much power of constantly knowing what your exact emotions are on everything. It is just so unnecessary that it causes one to question why in the world would we risk giving computers that kind of power. Also, is it appropiate to constantly scan childrens' faces as they are trying to learn? Would there be a security system in place or parental agreement necessary that would allow the permission of constant invasion of privacy in the name of education? There are many ethical questions and unknown future outlooks that one would not want to subject children to that sort of test of safety and security.

However if this technology was to be used in a classroom, the next question is of course the cost of such a new computer process. All computers would have to have facial recognition in their system and although there is no mention of cost in the article one can imagine that this new technology is not cheap. Is it realistic to expect that schools will pay great amounts of tax payers dollars just so that we can invade the privacy of our children to figure out if they are bored? It seems much more financially sound to not steal the jobs of millions of teachers and let them get to know their students, opposed to scanning their face.

Teachers are necessary in the classroom not only to impart knowledge but also to make those personal connections that tell them how to best teach their kids. Every student is different, learns a different way and reacts differently to every aspect of the classroom. The article says a computer will be able to detect if a student is bored, but teachers have that ability already, minus the cost and invasion of privacy. Teachers are in the classroom so that they can make those personal connections with each student and ensure that they are doing everything they can to provide the best education possible. If a computer detects boredom it will just try another lesson without knowing what is best for the student. So the question that needs to be asked is why would this sort of technology be useful in the classroom?

In conclusion technology that scans your face to read your emotions has too many ethical questions, financial problems, and no personal connections for this computer process to be acceptable in the classroom. Although this advancement is impressive, the classroom setting is most definitely not the right place for this type of computer process.",0,0.7265364,1,False

Yet at the end of each school year teachers give out a summer project to these students, expecting it to be done by the start of next school year. Some times the project is to read a book other times it is to watch a movie, but sometimes it is to wright an essay or create a piece of art. All of this is assigned for a three month break, and usually a student receives a project like this from all of his or her teachers. Most these project will take 3-4 days to complete. That is around one month of summer dedicated to doing school work. How can this be made easier for students? If teachers made it simpler! Teachers should design summer projects because having predetermined topics will shorten the length of the project, project topics will be related to bettering students lives outside of academics, and topics of a similar subject will encourage student to communicate over summer.

While some people believe that students should design these projects by themselves. Citing that it will help the students to learn more and they are more likely to be enthusiastic about his or hers own project. When students design there own project he or she can pick the subject, the method, even the form of presentation. Nevertheless, with such a broad variety of options, students could not receive credit from a teacher because there project did not have the proper category or criteria. This would lead to a student starting of the year with a low grade which could be difficult for he or she to raise depending on the grading scale.

Having a list of topics to choose from would shorten projects length by a large percent taking at the least the two to three day brain storming period away. This would give student more time to work on the project its self, and more time for he or she to do things they want to do. There is a lot of planning that goes in to summer by the students . Students sign up for trips to places all around the world other students sign up for summer jobs and some students stay home. By shortening the time it would take students to to finish there projects. Students would have more time to enjoy there break and take advantage of there much needed vacation.

When teachers design the summer project they can relate it to bettering students live outside of academics. An example being the gap between junior and senior year, most students will be doing one of three things; working at a job, working at a internship, or working on college visits. If teachers knowing that the following year the first thing students will be doing is to wright up a college essays. Making the project about researching your college of choice and finding there essay requirements. Students would be able to to do something that they already should have been working on, and with the incentive of a good grade students would put more effort in to finding this information about his or her school of choice. In other summers students can be encouraged to get internships and have jobs over summer to help set students up for the world out side of academics. By having the project relate to life outside academics teachers can help student complete projects that already relate to bettering there lives and setting them on track for a wonder full and productive life.

When student are all given choices from the same list then there topics will be similar, this will encouraging the possibility of group work. There is a large range of advantages to group work, especially, over summer. Group work can help students when they are all reading the same book or drafting the same essay. It gives students a outlet to brainstorm together and bounce ideas of each other. This can help students to grow and strengthen there ability to socialize, be criticized, and even to compromise. Group work will also help the students who are less likely to adventure of of the house during the summer months weather it is be because they are antisocial or just lazy the incentive of getting a better grade by talking to fellow class mates may encourage said students.

When teachers design project students are given more time to be them selves, more time to gain experience out side of academics, and are even encouraged to work in groups which helps students to grow as people. Summer is a vital time to teenagers and teachers should not create obstacles to take away from this important time students get to be them selves.  ",0,0.006887772,0,True
4E163434729E,"Have you ever been bored at home wishing you had something to do? Extracurricular activities could be the solution you're looking for. A daily occurrence that happens to students and myself is that at some point you end up texting your friends because you're bored school can help change that. Extracurricular activities that students can participate in are Sports,Student Council,and Yearbook.

Sports are a big part of schools all around the world since it has many advantages. One thing that sports can help in is helping students stay active throughout the day. Doctors recommend staying active because the body becomes stronger and healthier. Another benefit ,believe it or not, is that Sports can help students work better together. People say theres no I in team thats because in order for a group of people to come together they need to improve they're teamwork to be successful. This extracurricular activities is suitable for many people because of the variety of sports that there are. It takes time for someone to find what they like to do,but because of all the choices students can try different sports until they find one that they enjoy best. One thing that I like about sports best is that they have endless opportunities for you to enjoy yourself.

If Sports isn't your thing you can try Student Council it also has many things to offer. In Student Council you have the chance in meeting new people all the time. The council requires you to work and talk to many people to help better the school and other students daily lives. As you grow older you'll acquire many life skills all student council will do is improve those skills to better prepare you for the next chapter in your life. Think of student council as an office they both have similar ways of running and getting work down the only difference is that they're on different scales. The thing about student council is that they do many things but a big role they play is helping others. The council does many projects to help students and the community like donating,holding fundraisers,and community service. Student Council plays a big role in school,students,and the community if you're the type of person that enjoys helping others Student council is just for you!

On the other hand many people say that an extracurricular activity takes your time away or is a waste of time. The reason for this is that many activities are held after school instead of school hours. However this is not true,nor correct,because extracurricular activities were not designed to take and waste students time. Students will be able to still be able to enjoy and relax during their free time. This is because the activities only take away a small portion of a students daily life plus there are some activities that are held during school hours like yearbook allowing students to take it as a class.

Every school has a wide range of clubs or activities,so that all the students can choose one to their liking that way they can enjoy it other then having to take something they have no interest in doing. Taking a extracurricular activities has many good outcomes and benefits from helping students improve their skills to allowing them to enjoy themselves and have fun. Taking part in a club affects everybody in a positive form it also is a good way for students to be more productive while having fun.",0,0.0067571336,0,True

In other hand , is a good reason for the people still studied, and is not an excuse for say that they do not have time.

The people can recive the classes after, that work. Students can have more time for learn and they can choose when they want recive the classes they can organize their time. Also, it is a good idea for help people that even finished high school , they can be more focus on the differents classes and give the best of them.

Take classes by online it is a wonderful idea, because is something that can be avaliable for all people any time and in the cold days when is to difficult go outside students always will take the classes and they does not miss anything . This also, help to the studesnts to recive classes every day .

I am, completely agree with can take that classes online or video conferencing is a big benefict for students in addiction people that maybe never studied in their lives can take this classes and learn a lot, because some people have to work all day, and do not can in to a school that is a very big tool that can help their.

A lot of people can be agree and can support this great idea. Also, students that want lo learn a languaje or need support in a class can choose the class most need it . and can take and extra time to learn because they gonna take the clases in home and do not miss time taking a bus or driving a car.

Even people that is in school sometimes have to walk and it is so difficult , because sometimes is snowing or raining, and they miss more time and mometimes miss all day of classes . every minute counts and that is another one great reason to support it , because people can have more time.

Seconds can make a big difference, in their lives people can finished their goals and get a diploma for can have a better jod and still helping their families.

In addiction some people can get more adtitude and concentration, for each class they can take it in the living room, dinning room or just sit in the sofa, in the kitchen or bed, every place, where they want and fell more confortable, and if you fell confortable you can give the best you can.

I think that some people work better and get more concentration , when they are alone, because you do not talk with other people you work in your own. people do not can take answer from another people if are taking a online class, so it is another reason that a lot , because you have to doing your work. and you have to be concentrate and pay attention.

people also can take the classes in the wekends . the sudents that are taking classes by online can have the choice if they want to take and extra class or get support . I think that all people ,deserve can have the opportunity that can still studied. all people should have the same opportunity , It is also a good idea, because all people can get that clases and be better proffesionaly, and good citizens and help the world be the change that de world need it, because some people that are so itelligent do not have opportunity to get a good aducation even assist to high school and how i said before . I think that are the people is equal ,and deserve the same opportunities, that others have.

Some people, can be so proud know that can retake school or begging . thats will be a big hope for the people that is not study but they want to. It is a lot of reasons for can say that take classes by online or video conferencing is like the best idea that someone can have .

In other words take online classes is a great tool for that everyone can have acces to study. and get the same opportunities, that everyone deserve. and also help to learn more people can use their time apropiately. and can have acces to each class that they need it everyone can and can work and after take the classes .

Although most people arent in favor of the cause, they dont know the real effects of the gas that is produced by cars around the world. The gasses that are released from cars are very hazardous to the ozone, and can cause environmental changes if too much gas is released. For example in Paris, they had  a almost near-record pollution buildup, and since diesel is popular in France because of a tax policy that favors diesel over standard gasoline, the gas released from diesel was more thicker and hazardous. After a bunch of air pollution built up, they enforced a ban that would stop cars from driving for a specific amount of time to halt the gas buildup. If you were caught driving when the ban was active,you were fined 22 euros, (or in american currency, 31 dollars) and people the declined the fine, the authorities impounded their car. Paris was generous enough to allow public transit and it would be free of charge, but it wasn't too easy for the companies to budge because they would be losing money.

In Bogota, Columbia, they have already been taking action in this gas problem, by banning cars for a specific amount of time, but this is their third straight  year doing this. This campaign originated in the 1990s and was said to improve Bogota. They have constructed 118 miles of bicycle paths and have promoted bicycle use. A business man named Carlos Arturo said that ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" which is entirely true.

But it also says that it's a compromise between the votes in Congress , and the votes of the popularity from the people. Is it a 50/50 compromise or does Congress have a stronger voting advantage over the people?

I think that if your going to make Congress's choices , able to rule over the peoples , then there shouldn't be two sides of the voting. Its not fair to us. It should be an equal advantage. There should be a way for that to happen if there already isn't one. Congress and society need to have an equal chance at electing the best man for the job.

The electoral college is widely regarded as an anachronism. A non-democratic method of selecting a president ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes , the winner. The cause of this is probably because Congress think theyare more wise and think this throught more then the people do. But I think differently. The citizens of the US , can be just as smart as Congress. Maybe even smarter or wiser.

I usually like asking one person like an adult, mostly because they won't ignore you, and they may have the answer your're looking for. I don't like asking students in general, for help cause they will most likely ignore me most of the time, and they may probably not know the answer to your question. Another way I think asking one person for help is ok, is if you ask and adult, ""I always ask an adult first."" If I ask an adult I usually ask just the one, like my teacher for example. ""Because asking an adult usually helps a lot."" Lets say you asked more then one person, and they all had different answers, you could narrow it down to who had the best answer, letting you decide which one made the most sense. And you're learning better that way, ""in my opinion"". Here are some examples of why asking more than one person is ok.

One of them might have the correct answer

They may walk you through it

Narrow it down finding different answers

Both sides have their ups and downs. But if i had to pick one side, it would have be asking more then one person for help. If i'm asking more then one person then I like asking students, because asking more then one adults it would be to weird. It would be almost like asking 20 ensigns for help, don't waste your time asking for that much help, just ask one of them and they will have the answer. Also asking for an adults help makes me sometimes feel uncomfortable, I like asking my friends and see what they think. Some reasons about asking one person for advice

One way to be able to accomplish things is if you have a goal set. If you set a goal that means you are going to want to achieve it. Prove others that you can do it and that nothing can stop you from doing it. Always give it your best, never think negative because if you think negative then you're never going to accomplish anything in life. Prove to yourself that you can also try new things and that can help you a lot.

Always be confident in yourself no matter what. Always put in mind that you can do whatever you want to do. For example, if you have to mow the lawn but you're in your bedroom laying down looking out the window, the lawn isn't going to mow itself because it needs someone to move it around. Trying new things doesnt hurt at least trying for quite some time and it also benefits you because you're doing something for your own good.

Never use laziness as an excuse to not do anything. If you always say i'm tired then you're never going to do anything, you're just giving up on yourself.

For example, if you hate being home all day doing nothing, then go out go find what you can do because if you try new things you'll end up liking it. If you're an active person you'll accomplish way more than expected because you're going to be moving around and getting out you're comfort zone. Helping others also can be a way in accomplishing more than just sitting there because you're talking to someone or showing someone how to do something. Helping the community in many different ways can also be a good thing but not just for you but the community, because you're going out and helping. Doing and trying new things motivates you to keep doing more.

I strongly do believe that if you're doing something that you put your mind to, then you're always going to accomplish more than expected. If you sit down and say you're going to do something you'll never do it because you're just sitting down. Your words are way different than your actions.

Most cars pollute the air we breath, things would be different because think of all the money you could save by not having to buy gas or another car, and also think of how lazy cars have made people today cities would improve if people just walked instead of driving to and from work.

""On monday motorists with evennumbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine"" Robert Duffer. he also said that diesel fuel was blamed and that it is worse than the normal gasoline. once a majority of the people had stayed off the roads for a while the smog eventually cleared up.

Another statistic from the passage was that ""the rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three yeas before the downturn""Elisabeth Rosenthal. Even most middle class people have working cars some struggle to pay their car payments and with the cost of gas high too they could really have a hard time.

1D97FDC7B2AE,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto, a new techonology known as the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) provides computers and devices to identify emotions in humans. The techonlogy does this through scanning facial muscle movements and with basic psychology knowldege. However, this new techonlogy is also being proposed to being used in schools to have more effective schooling based on the emotions of students. The using of FACS to determine the emotinos of students is valuable because it allows for more interactive lessons that are based off of non-verbal communication, which will help students succeed at a higher level.

With the inception of FACS, the interactions between humans and computers can become more efficient, and will allow for more streamlined communication. In the article, Dr. Huang, the creator of FACS, states that ""Most human communication is nonverbal, inlcluding emotional communication"" (6). If in a classroom situation, a computer trying to teach a lesson with students might not be able to understand if its pupils are getting the concepts, or it wouldn't be able to dectect whether the students are paying attention or being engaged. Since most human interactions are non-verbal, the computer would have a hard time communicating with the students to understand what was wrong. With FACS, however, the computer can analyze non-verbal cues and alter its teaching style. This in turn would allow the students to have a better time and have a higher understanding of the materials being learned.

Not only does the concept and development of FACS allow for more streamlined communcation between humans and computers in the classroom, it also removers barriers between humans and computers by allowing computers to act more like humans, creating a more effective learning environment. In the article, D'Alto states that like how FACS learns to interpret emotions based on non-verbal facial cues, ""we humans perform this same impressive 'calculation' every day""(5). This means that by giving computers/teachers the ability to accuratley identify emotins (to some extent), we are lessening the difference between a physical and a digitial teacher by making the computer more ""human"". In an age where the world is becoming more and more digital, it is a neccesity that students and computers are able to communicate effectively. If Dr. Huang's quote ""'The facial expressions for each emotion are universal'""(4), is true, this means that if a computer can analyze mixed human emotions in a classroom setting, it is possible that not only will the computer modify lesson plans to make teaching more interesting, it will also have an almost artificial empathy, allowing for students to be more accepting of a digitial counterpart.

In addition to streamlining communication and being more relatable to students, the usage of FACS system in a classroom computer can also be used to solve conflicts and make resolutions between students. In the article, D'Alto states that some facial muscle movements, showcase negative emotinos and false emotions as well. One of these muslces is the orbicularis oris, which tightens one's lips to show anger(3). Furthermore, certain muslce cues ""even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one""(8). Since FACS is able to analyze these kinds of movements as well, it can detect when two students are angry at one another, or when a student is lying or being subtly disrepctful. By being able to recognize these situations, the FACS system can advise teachers on how to solve these various conflicts or negative scenarios and can be of use to better the general nature of the classroom.

Overall, throughout Nick D'Alto's article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", it is shown that by using the technology known as FACS, communcation between humans and computers can be streamlined. When placed in a school, FACS is valuble because it modify lessons to make teaching more effective, be more relatable and approachable to students, and can resolve conflicts in a classroom. In the future, with more and more systems such as FACS being implemented, it is possible that soon computers will devlop emotions of their own!         ",0,0.061083958,0,True
76C5B28AB007,"Driverless cars may be coming in our future, but they most likely will not be commonly used. Driving a car run by a computer allows a number of problems to occur. Since 2009, driverless cars have been around. These cars are only considered driverless under certain conditions though. If the car is not reliable in all traffic conditions, people should not rely on them to get them where they need to go safely.

Society today relies on technology and computers for almost everything from talking to friends to sending military signals hundreds of miles. At times, even the most advanced technology glitches. Driving a car that is controlled by technology would pose the same problems. Would the car still drive if it started raining? What would happen if the rotating sensor on the roof glithched? A driver, assuming the car is driving, may not be attentive and see the signal given by the car for the human to take over. The car could crash causing even bigger problems than just faulty technology.

Crashes occur even when human drivers are in control of the car. It is inevitable that crashes are likely to happen in the autonomous cars as well. Paragraph 9 states that, ""in most states it is illegal to even test computer-driven cars."" If these driverless cars are better than having a human behind the wheel, most states would allow them to be tested. Even if they were tested and allowed to be driven new laws would have to be put into place. In the case of an accident, would drivers or manufacturers be at fault for the accident? Drivers might claim that they did not see the signs that the car gave them signifying that the human was supposed to take over. Manufacturers would argue saying that the driver was unattentive to their surroundings.

Drivers who rely on computer driven cars may loose the skills needed to drive a car over time. If they do not drive in favorable conditions, because the car is driving, how will the manufacturers expect them to be able to drive in hazardous conditions. Practice makes perfect; without practice, a driver will not be close to perfect. Switching to cars being driven by humans in times of unstable conditons could potentially cause more accidents.

Driverless cars might sound like a fantastic idea. When the different risks are taken into consideration, a human life should be more important than not having to drive. The reliability of the autonomous cars is not strong enough at this time to be considered safe. Humans should keep driving cars and computers should stick to sending text messages.",0,0.0067075985,0,True

For example: the lunches gives us two options one is pizza and the other rice with chicken, students will definitly go for pizza.

It would be a good idea that the school lunches menu changes to a healthy menus. We do need to consider other students and their eating habbits, most students doesn't even eat, they even go a whole day without eating. If the school were to change the unhealthy food they should get rid of pizza, hot dogs, and chicken nuggets and make up for potatos with rice and chicken, a nice pasta salad with tomatoes, onions, and, spinich. Some students are vegan so maybe they can have a veggie burger anything with veggies. If that's the case to change school lunch menu, the school should consider about how and where they should spend money on things like changing the floor tiles it's unnecessary it could have been for something better. No one really cares about how bad the school lunch is, it's not worst thing in the world. Anyways thats why us students have to be smart and bring our own food to school like most of them do.

In reality, it really doesn't matter because students still eat school food, some students do complain about how nasty the food is but they still won't bring their own food how logical is that. To be honest there are sometimes good lunches like we said before it's not best thing in the world. So it's okay don't waste on changing something when you knew it could of been done from the start. Just bring your own food from home and you won't have worry about the school menu.",0,0.0070168404,0,True
73930228893B,"I feel like if students want to graduate in three years or two years they should talk to someone like there teachers and they can ask them if there GPA is low.

there is a lot of ways that they can help them for an example if they are failing any classes then they can take some classes online, or if they can go to night school,or stay after school for more help. There is a another way for them they can go to school summer and they can take classes the ones that they fail or take some other classes the ones that they need to take if they don't want to keep on going to school. also if they stay in school, no abuses, and stay out of trouble they can probably graduate in three years.

If there bad grades are low or GPA they can take a another class that can bring up there grade up like, do a sport, like soccer or art. or they can ask a teacher if they can change there class where there where is two teachers.

I feel like my school they should let students graduate with a low GPA because there is some students that have a hard time keeping up there grades up like. If they have a brother, or sister that they have to take care of or they have to work two jobs to help there parents out. but i feel like students shouldn't work while going to school because that how they get bad grades and can't bring up any grades up. what i like about my school is that they let students pass there sol's with a 375 or more the ones that are in small group and that they need more help.",0,0.00742484,0,True
6321CFDD093A,"Taking an online course can benefit a high school student in many various ways: they get to work in their own environment, it is a 1-on-1 process, they do not feel the pressure to catch up with other students as they would in a regular classroom, and it helps students work on a self-managed schedule. Although physically going to school helps with hands-on experience and social environments, could online classes or video conferences benefit a student as well?

Permitting a student to take courses online can have many takeaways. It can limit their social skills, working habits, and it lacks the assistance of a teacher in their presence. Some teens are not responsible enough to manage their time wisely for online classes and can disregard the importance of maintaining a set schedule for their classes. As well, some teens dont realize how hard it can be taking courses at home; you may not have to deal with the loud, obnoxious environment or constantly having to catch up with other classmates and teacher but it is obligatory that you turn in work on time and comprehend it takes more responsibility to ""teach yourself"" a course rather than having someone teach you the material and answer your questions in person.

Some people address that attending school physically has many more benefits, online can have just as many perks. All schools should offer distance learning because students who struggle in the classroom have potential to do better online. It builds a students confidence knowing that they can understand the material they are doing online, at the pace they need. As well, students can become more comfortable with their work area because they get to choose where they want to work. Giving them the ability to explore while doing work is dire for a teen. Keeping students in one area per class for an entire year does not engage students or excite them for what they might learn.

To add on, attendance is a great matter in school. If a student is home sick and has missed class, they would have to go online and get all the missing work they need to catch up on. Falling behind because of absent days is stressful for the student and the teacher because they must both make sure that the student is on track with classwork, homework, and tests... but if that student was home sick and did online school, they wouldn't have to stress at all because they can still continue to do their mandatory work for the day. Convenient, right?

Online school has more benefits than people believe and is a great alternative for students who would like to do better in class while out of the classroom. Each individual student learns in a different way at their own pace and online school can give them the opportunity to figure out how to enhance their work ethics and become more responsible. Nonetheless, online school is just as beneficial as physically attending school and could open new doors for students when it comes to better working habits and becoming more confident in your classes.",0,0.042988323,0,True
1067F963AD23,"Do you really think that there is aliens on Mars just because there is a formation of a face landform on Mars? Many people believe that there is other lifeforms living in our solar system like the people who think there are aliens on Mars. These people think this way because there appears to be a landform on Mars that looks like a face, but these people are wrong. The face on Mars is nothing but a natural landform, and just because it is there, does not mean that there has to be aliens up there.

The face looking landform on Mars is just a natural landform, and does not mean there is aliens living on Mars. According to the article, it states that, "" it was only another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia"". This proves that this is not the only time this has happened on Mars, and does not mean that there is aliens on Mars just because of a naturally occuring landform.

Some people thought is was an alien artifact and that means that aliens had to have lived there. The article states that, "" Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact"". So very few scientists believed this was true, which is not very many, and these are people who studied this for a while and only a few think that aliens are living on Mars because of this landform. Then a man named Jim Garvin took a photo of the landform when he had the chance and also revealed that the Face was just a natural landform. The last paragraph in the article states that the picture shows that these types of landforms are common.

So research has told us that this face on Mars is not an alien artifact, but just a naturally occuring landform. There are many reports and research on this topic, but has all lead to the Face just being a landform. There are probably still people who believe in this theory, but they cant see what really is just a landform and not some made up nonsense about how something that looks like a face on a planet means that there had to be aliens living there.

15398FCF1379,"How can someone make a better choice by hearing multiple people's opinions? Receiving multiple opinions can increase the chances of making a good and responsible choice. If someone were to ask only one person for advice, they may not choose the most responsible choice. When someone hears multiple responses, they'll most likely choose the response they hear most. Hearing advice from multiple people helps make a responsible decision and helps people who are unsure and worried about making making a bad choice.

Seeking advice from multiple people creates a responsible decision. If someone were to ask for just one persons opinion, they could make the wrong choice. The first person may not be the most responsible and don't think about the negative outcomes of making that decision. They just want to make a choice even if it's reckless. Hearing from more than one voice will give someone more options and then they can see what decision most of the people chose. However, if multiple people were choosing a bad decision, it could plant the wrong idea into someone's mind still leading to a bad choice. For example, if someone already had an idea in their head and they go to ask a few people for advice, multiple people could tell them to make the wrong choice and change the persons mindset completely. This is why it's necessary to ask people that are responsible, more specifically adults that are able to make more responsible decisions. Adult or not, it is important to ask for more than one persons opinion if you are seeking advice.

Hearing more than one opinion is super beneficial to someone who is completely stuck and unsure if they are going to make the right choice. If someone didn't have any idea on what decision to make, hearing the same response from multiple people helps a ton. It also is super beneficial when someone may think they know what choice they want to make, but hearing it from other people may reassure them or make them change their mind to make a good choice. As an example, someone may think they're about to make a good choice when in reality, they're not. The person may ask people if it's a good decision and the majority of opinions may change that persons mind.

Seeking advice to make the right choice from many people helps make a good decision even if the person may be set on one choice. As long as responsible people are being asked, a good decision is sure to be made.",0,0.0070319995,0,True

Even though people think the ""Winner-take-all"" system is not fair i think it keeps everything in line. There are reasons why this system was created to prevent major problems from happening.

I think that it does not matter if Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, and the AFL-CIO all want to Abolish the electoral college. Sure over 60 percent of votes would prefer a direct electionto the type of elction that we have now  but I think it will just cause problmes. We would have to make new rules to when it comes to voting which could take a long time because we would have to have he approval of many people. Then everyone would have to learn these rules and the age to vote could be possibly changed. For everone to get used to these rules could cause many fights and arguements between peopl.

I also think that asking more than one person is a great thing, because seeking multiple opinions can help make better choices, make sure all the facts are right, or if someone is wrong about something.

The way seeking multiple opinions and help you make better choices is by one person my say all these good thing about one collage and another person might tell say the complete opposite of that. Even if that wasn't enough to make the decision which collage to go to it would never hurt to get a third opinion. It can also be at a job that may not be the best but just by getting someone else say in that job it could possibly change anyone point of view on that job and it could help them make their decision easier. Adults and young adults may need help by picking a new car out, because car are really expensive and there is a lot to look at like the gas, how many miles, and the amount the car cost.

With young adults they can make some pretty bad decisions and serious ones to like taking drugs. Many teems think that taking drugs wont effect them or they wont get addicted but before they think about doing drugs they should ask a trusting friend that is a good influence and hear what they have to say.

Another way seeking multiple opinions can be help is when doing a paper and looking at different web sites. When on Wikipedia not all their fact are true, because anyone one can go on there and put whatever they want to. So thats its always good to go to more than one website when researching something. In school not all the teachers think alike clause when asking for help by one teacher they my tell you this is the answer but when going to another teacher they may think other wise but this doesnt always happen because most of the teachers know what their doing.

The last way seeking multiple opinions can also help with small thing like picking out clothes or what bag of chips to get. It may just seem like a bag of chips but when asking one friend to see if the new pringles chips are good or not and they say no but your other friend says they are the best thing in the world. So then when asking your third friend they say they are the best thing to so when trying them they were actually the best thing ever. Its little things like that can make change someones future because now their kids are going to grow up eating those chip and so on.

7109E73A180D,"With the education system constantly evolving, our children are exposed to a myriad of different ways to learn. Whether it be public, private, or even home school, with this many options, it can be difficult to decide which could be the most beneficial for their development. Although these systems are successful, there are some schools that offer distance learning, a way for students to pursue their studies from home through online classes or with video conferencing. This concept can benefit students by cutting out the need for transportation, ease stress, and even making class more comfortable. However, even with it's multitude of pros, there are also cons such as if WiFi is not present, the many distractions of the home, and the loss of the joy of making new friends at school. Distance learning can be a successful aid to a child's learning experience, but with the cons in mind, there are evidently many challenges one must overcome in order to pursue it.

Although the vast majority of schools offer buses to transport the children to school, there are some students who live outside of bus districts, and, therefore, have to drive to get there. Even if they do ride the bus, what if they miss it and there's nobody home to drive them? Fortunately, distance learning eliminates this conflict, as they wouldn't need to travel anywhere to pursue their education. This not only eases the stress off the student, but also the parent. No longer would they have to worry about how their child is getting to school. Regarding easing stress, distance learning can also eliminate the stress of school itself. Assuming they're comfortable in their own home, studying can be much easier and more relaxing. Although comfortable learning brings it's benefits, it also brings it's issues.

A comfortable and cozy environment can be the perfect place for students to study and do their school work. Students such as myself, however, can become extremely distracted by their surroundings and loose focus easily. Assuming they weren't doing a video conference with a teacher or a parent wasn't present to supervise, students can easily watch TV or go on their devices when they should be doing their work. Regarding the internet, what if the child's family doesn't have access to WiFi? This factor could ultimately eliminate the possibility of pursuing distance learning, as all of it is to be done on the internet. If only those fortunate with access to WiFi and can afford devices can do this type of schooling, then everyone else would be forced to either go to a normal public school or even no school at all.

Although distance learning has it's multitude of perks and benefits, I would not wish to switch from my public school in order to pursue it. If I did, I would loose all the wonderful friends I have made over the years. Making friends and building relationships is what makes going to school fun and amusing. Although some can argue that having friends in your classes is distracting, which is true, but working together with them can make learning easier and more exciting. It's the friends you make that create school to be so much more rememberable; school appears boring without them.

There is no such thing as the perfect school; it doesn't exist. Whatever path a student decides to take in order to accomplish their studies, they will inevitably have to work hard and diligently to make it work for them. Distance learning can help students succeed, but what brings benefits always brings challenges. What brings challenges, however, will always bring solutions. ",0,0.9934058,1,False

Cell phones and cars are not a good mix and people should never try and use both at the same time. Using both phone and car at the same time can cause a major accident and can cause people to get hurt because someone wanted to use their phone while they drove their car. When you use your phone while driving you are putting more than yourself at risk of losing your life you also endanger the person you crash into and whoever you or they have in the car. When these two items mix it is no good for anybody especially the ones on the street.

The world is a very exciting place and there is so much to do and can even do multiple things at once, but somethings shouldn't be done while another is happening. Being on your phone while driving is one of the many things you shouldn't do it causes accidents that will leave someone badly damaged or without their life. When someone loses their life their family will grieve and you shouldn't want to be the cause of their or your family's grief so you should take precautions that you stay out of situations that could put you in the wrong spotlight.

On average 11 teens die a day from texting and driving. These are people who just wanted to see what their friends had to say or what's trending on instagram. As sad as it is, these people didn't take good precautions before they took off in the car, they just wanted to arrive at the location they were headed too. They didn't think that they were going to lose their life from texting and driving. People should learn from others' mistakes and shouldn't text and drive knowing it is dangerous.

There are over 2.35 million people in the United States today that are injured or disabled due to a car crash, and there are more than 330,000 of those accidents due to Texting and driving. When a person text while driving there is never a good outcome of them doing that a young teen or an older person or there self ends up getting hurt in the process. The generation today's technology has drastically increased. People are so reliant on the use of their phones and more things. Nowadays a lot of people don't even like to have a phone conversation simply because they can send it through a text. The conclusion of all the car wrecks the accident is mostly caused by a person wanting to text while driving .

The purpose of this essay is to give you some information on why you shouldn't text and drive at the same times. People always think they have to immediately have to respond to a text this is why many of the accidents occur. The ages that always cause accidents are the teens the ages from 17 and up they always act like soon as they hear that ding they have to check their phone. Don't text and drive text there is never a good outcome of that, think about your life and others. Text and drive doesn't mix you need your eyes on the road you can not text and drive, don't even think about picking your phone up. If you even think about picking your phone up just pause and think about how many lives you will be putting at risk by picking up your phone.

I honestly assume it would be better if the cell phone policy in our school was to allow students to have phones out during lunch periods and free available time. If we had that privilege, I don't think kids would be so impatient to take out their phones out during school hours. The drastic amount of students in our school would be thrilled to have this privilege. Yes, school is all about education and being a good student, but I think we could append some entertainment.

Currently, we have policy number two where we can't take have our phones out at school at all.

Sometimes I do see with my two eyes that students in our school text during class, and its those certain type of kids that are the reason we don't have the privilege at all to have our phones out at all not even during lunch period. Maybe if you're reconsidering this option, we could possibly establish a noble social contract we could have this right, and kids wouldn't be so urged to take their phones out during school. Certain students like me, sometimes have to call their parent or guardian during school hours for something that's involved with school. I only use my phone during school for important intentions.

I have many reasons to respectfully agree and disagree for the placement of your Electoral College. In many ways I know you have your reasoning for why you belive our country needs our Electoral voters, but it some cases others such as me don't belive that we do. I fully respect your decisions as Senator, but I would like to shed some light upon the situation, from the people's views.

For about 3 years now, I have been researching how the Electoral College works. Upon discovering many news and magazine articles, I noticed that many people are not in favor of the final, decided stage of election. In my eyes I see that I am not getting my full rights and potential as a voter and a legal citizen as I should be granted. Instead, I am voting for other people to vote for me, and I think that is unfair to myself, and my fellow U.S. citizens. I do not believe that all Americans are educated in the field of knowing that they are not getting the majority vote, and that the Electoral College is.

Aside from my doubts in the way this situation works, i discovered and realized that the Electoral College is a more organized and aforable way of deciding things. In the winner-takes-all stand point as most people call it, some voters take advantage of the voting system and choose someone running for President based upon look, appeal, or ethnicity. In situations such as this, I do believe it is important for an Electoral College to step in, for the pure fact of too many random and unthought choices.

My overall decision Senator, would be that the popular vote of the people would be more respectful as a group, than as a seperate election diferentiating between the people, and the Electoral College. With our votes we are deciding who we want to run our country, and who we want to make decisions that are best for us. With other people deciding our views on how to run our government, we are not getting what we want or need. Senator, I leave you with this, is it about the people's rights, or the people's thoughts on the unknown?                                                    ",0,0.009726308,0,True
EA317CE76E48,"The summer before the upcoming school year, many schools require students to do a summer project. These projects are usually designed to make sure that the students are still learning over their break. When these projects are assigned, the teachers are in charge of what the project is going to be about. Most students feel as if they should decide what the project should be about. I believe that teachers should design summer projects because when the following school year comes along the project will go along with what they are about to learn, the students would be challenged, and it would be overall more beneficial to the students as a whole.

When teachers design a project, it always has some sort of purpose behind it. Assigning these projects over the summer would allow students to have a start on the lesson before the school year starts. The students would have an idea of what they would be learning about the upcoming school year. With this advantage, teachers would use time in the classroom more effectively. This will also cause students to have the thought of school already in their mind.

Another factor to look into when teachers design the summer projects, it would create a challenge for the students. If the students were in charge of designing a project, then they are most likely to pick something that doesn't require a lot of thought. As a teacher, their job is to generate the students' mind. Designing challenging projects would do just that. This would cause students to have the urge to learn more about the project. Also, when they get back to school they would have numerous questions about the project.

Although some may say that if teacher-designed projects are implemented, then the students may not be interested. Simply because of the fact that it is not a topic they particularly want to learn about. While that may be true, ultimately it would be more beneficial the students if the teacher designed them. If the students creates the project, then they could possibly pick a topic that doesn't really benefit them in the future. When the teachers create the project, the students are more likely to get something out of the project.

In closing, teachers should design the summer projects. This decision would benefit the students as whole. It would guarantee that the students are actually learning during the summer. Teachers wouldn't have to worry about students making a project that didn't require a lot of thinking. Also, it would cause teachers to not start a completely fresh lesson when the school year starts. The whole idea of summer projects is to continue learning outside the ten month school year, that can't happen if the students are in charge of the other two months. ",0,0.0067745494,0,True

One huge thing that you would have to be willing to do is take care of all of the animals on the ship sailing with you like young cows, horses, and mules. Like Luke the animals on the ship would keep you busy, you would have to feed them and give them water at least three times a day, pull bales of hay and bags of oats out from lower holds of the ship, and clean out the stalls. Also you would get to go to many amazing places around the world like Luke did. You might get to go to places like Europe and China and see Acropolis in Greece, and maybe take a gondola ride in Venice, and see Italy the city with streets of water. You would also have to be careful while board the ship.

When luke is helping people they also get to go to special places such as the Acropolis in Greece was special,""So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city of streets of water."" He also toured and excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

What if I don't want to help said one of the people Luke had ask and what if I don't like taking care of people or animals. Luke had just said but it's a lifetime chance to go to all of those places and it would really make you happy but, if you don't want to go then just don't go. then that person named Joe said he wanted to go and that was Lukes best friend and Luke knew that they were going to have fun.

f81d371d,"Dear, senator I believe the electoral college was a useful tool in the past ,but is now an out date system that should be changed. If we continue to use this system we aren't really giving the people a fair chance to vote for who they want. For example in California a more democratic state republicans may be lessen the incentive to vote knowing that there vote will not have an effect. This raise another issue, which is not everybody is voting and it is not all a right but a prestige among US citizens every where. The electoral college was elective in the past because we did not have the technology to count all the votes from each state, but now we do so we can only go by the popular vote.

The popular vote is more effective and I'm not the only one who thinks so over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Al Gore thanks to the electoral college won the popular vot but lost the electoral, how is it that some one could win more votes from most voters ,but still lose? The answer is the electoral college, the reason is that you are not voting as a indiviual person but as a state. This brings me back to California and how republicans votes don't count because the state voted democrat.

Though the electors should do there job and vote with the state they could always defy the will of the people. In 1960 segregationist nearly succeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy.

4F2C6D1D9AF1,"I agree with the principle because it can relive stress, helps the school and teachers and lastly helps you out as well. I agree that every student should participate here is why. It could relive stress because there are stress free activities to do like drawing writing things in your journal or anything else that makes you relive stress. It helps the school you are in by doing the yearbook you would help teachers and staff members because they would have to do it because there is a team of students doing it already. Teachers would be closer to the students and bond and also know will also know there student a lot more.

If you are planning to play sports for the school if you win a major game or a championship your school will be said and many people would either want to go there after what they saw or they could see how your school is for education and go there. If you are talented at a sport or activity or hobby colleges might start looking to see if they want you. For example if you are very artistic and can draw very well a art school might want to take there offer for ten thousand yearly. Or if you are best in the football team and can throw far and catch colleges want you or even better they will give you a scholarship so that you could go there college for free for 4 years. That was only a couple of examples on what could happen.

It could help you in the future. You could make friends in these activities they could become your soul mate be your best friend until the end they could help you when your down or they can even become wealthy ans share there riches with you. It will prepare you for the future. It could be practice for a job you might want like for example the yearbook is practice for the newspaper. Or football on a high school team could be practice for the NFL. You could find a new hobby you might think you like drawing but when you try it you might like it. Those are some ways these activities could help your future or better prepare you for the future.

Its helpful to the school and staff and fun for the students. We could be closer as a school because everyone in the school will have a part to do if your in any class. More activities could be made because more people would ask for a certain activity to be made. since everyone is doing something we could ask if we could get more things like no homework for a day. Its not harmful unless you are doing a dangerous sport like football,soccer baseball and more. So everyone could a part in helping the school.

Others might say its a waste of time because not everyone wants to do it or wants to be a part of it. I personally think its a great idea but some people dont have the time or energy to do it. Its mainly meant so that everyone knows each other and that the students and teachers or students and staff memebers would be closer as well. My final thought about this whole thing is that its a great idea but not everyone it suited to do it and it would take a lot of work to get everyone to do it.

FF96C83B6CE0,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests hat studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents and supprts this idea carfully by giving clear evidence in the text. He goes on to describe the likelyhood of the past on Venus, the conditions in which sutdying the planet would take place, and how studying the planet may benifit the human race.

To begin with, the author makes a valid point by starting off with an explaination of the likely hood of Venus's features being closely related to those of Earth. The author goes on to tell the reader about the crucial consideration of visiting Venus. In the artical, it clearly states that ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solr system."" (Paragraph 4.) And goes on to tell, in detail, how ""Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth."" Giving clear examples of the likely hood that life could have very well been on Venus.

Furthurmore, the author also claims that the conditions Venus demonstrates, while studying its features and possible living conditions, could very well be possible given the right equiptment and procedure. The artical claims that Venus can, very well, be studied, and that ""Many reasearchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningful to our knowledge of Venus."" (Paragraph 6.) Given this example, it seems as though the author has a very well thought out point.

In addition, the author goes on to explain how benifitial studying Venus can be for the human population, and for the sake of science and curiosity in itself. For example, in paragraph 8, the author states ""Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" In other words, this tells us that we can and will gain from the planet, and possibly grow knowledge wise of the unknown mysteries on Venus.

To wrap things up, the author states clearly the facts on how dangerous studying and taking in information on Venus could truely be through-out the artical, but also gives valid points on the subject to support to his idea that ""studying Venus is a worthy pursuit depite the dangers it presents."" Including how it benifits, and the likely hood that the past could become a mere future depending on technology and the studys that can be found. The author makes very clear and considerable points in his argument.     ",0,0.022251636,0,True

If you are struggling with your school work at home it could be really hard to ask questions. If we are doing work from home we won't be able to work with our teachers one on one; therefore, it will make it much harder to bring our grades back up when we return to school. Some students work better in a louder environment, so if they have to work quietly at home they will not be as productive as they would in a classroom, and some students just work better when they get to hang out and talk with their friends instead of working quietly. Grading would be a lot slower and harder to keep track of, since they wouldn't be able to give quizzes or tests because everybody would take advantage and take it open book, and that would take away major grades that would normally help kids catch up.

Not all families will be able to pay for the materials necessary for distance learning, because not all schools supply their students with laptops. The students with free and reduced costs at school might not be able to work at home, because they might not be able to afford the fees or costs of programs for the online classes. How will the people who can't afford to have school at home be helped, so that they don't fall behind in their classes? How would the schools make sure that everyone has the materials that they need to get their work done before making the decision on distance schooling?

There are people who wouldn't do work because they would just wanna be relaxing at home since they would have the chance. Some people would just stay home and sleep and fall further behind, while some people take the time out of their day to get their work done. Some days people just might feel like doing any work, and it would be really hard to keep on top of everyone that decides to not do work. Since everybody will be at home there would be no punishments for the students that are just deciding to skip everything, and that would just make them feel like they can keep doing nothing.

0FE5C9C13E7A,"When you seek advice do you ask multiple people for their opinion? If not let me tell you why you should ask more than one person for advice. Asking for advice is a very easy way to get an answer for your situation. Imagine how easier it could get when you have more opinions to choose from. Asking multiple people for advice is a great way to get more than one opinion. Having more opinions gives you more options to choose from,also it gives you an open mind to start thinking about what you need. Therefor it helps you be more understanding when you hear other peoples perspectives.

Asking more than one person for advice is very helpful technique because it helps you make a better decision. Sometimes asking only one person for advice can get very frustrating. The reason why it can get very frustrating is because the one person will just go on and on about how they feel when your the one asking for advice. It can get way to full of opinions and end up changing your choice because you feel forced to. Also when you ask one person for advice it tends to only show you their part of the decision,but when you ask more than one person for advice you can get to see more parts of a whole.

Making your own decision can sometimes get very hard to do all alone. Thats why you should ask multiple people for advice. Asking more than one person for an answer can end you up with a wiser choice. Asking others for help can help you make a great decision and this can benefit your decision making. Dont be afraid to ask more than one person for their opinion because at the end it will help you a lot with making your choice.

Most of my decisions are made by asking others for advice when allowed too. Asking one person for advice does not help nearly as much as asking more than asking multiple people for advice. the reason why asking one person does not help me at all because they make it all about themselves. It makes me think that their decision has to be my decision as well ,which isnt true at all. When seeking advice from more than one person it helps me see different parts of my choice. Seeing many parts of my decision can help make it easier for me to pick a choice.

Asking more than one person for advice is the most helpful way to seek advice. It helps you make better choices and helps you see full parts of a decision. When you ask more people you have more opinions, which mean that you have more choices to choose from. Its way easier than making a decision all alone.

F6B4AEE412ED,"The electoral collage should be disbanded.  Not only is it unfair to minority party voters, but it also is unreliable.

The electoral collage consists of people voting for an elector, which in turn votes for a presedent.  This may sound like a good idea, but in reality, it over-complecated and scrambles things. This has lead to a less wanted canidate able to win the election. During 2000, presidential canidate Al Gore recieved the popular vote, but not the precidency, due to the proccess of voting for the electors, rather than the presedents.  This led to Al Gore recieving 266 electoral votes, and George W. Bush winning 271, therefore electing a less popular president. Not only that, but the ellectors being voted for may not even vote for the canidate they say they will.

The winner-takes-all strategy was placed to reduce the chance of ties and have the canidates focus on taking over the swing-state votes, but an unintended consequence was the reduction of voting from minory party votes, for example, when a Democrat in Texas or a Republican in New York votes, they hardly get any say, and therefore may stop voting.  A popular vote for presidency would allieviate this problem and make it able for anyone from a state to have an equal voice in the state.

Popular vote would lead to members of different states having the same amount of power, while the electoral collage leads to unequal representation.  Because of the Senate's two representitives per state, people in less populous states have more power.  For example, California has 2 Senate representitives and 35 million voters, and Wyoming, with a much smaller population, has the same amount of representitives in the Senate, leading to a Wyoming resident having much more than a Californian one.

All in all, the ellectoral collage is a bad idea.  Not only does it ensure inequallity, but it also leads to inaccurate voting and discrimination against a voter who votes for a  minority statewide canidate.  To trully be fair to all voters, the popular vote method should be implemented to resolve all the problems.

9FB9825462EE,"The subject of Schooling is a long, complicated and variable. From the debate on public versus private, homework, and the classes themselves, it is a truly mamothian subject. But amoung all of these differnt ideas, the subject of Long Distance Schooling (I.E Students learning from home via some sort of internet enabled device) is so often overlookd.

And i do belive that to be a true shame, for Long Distance Schooling (Hentsforth to be referred to as LDS) is a brilliant tool that should be used everywere! lets show its perks by means of an example. You live near a large metropolitan area, not unlike Generic_City or Generic_City. your daily commute to school can take you as long as 2 hours each way! this means you have to wake up early to get to school, and will have to stay up later to get all your work done. it could quite easily cause you to fall behind in sleep and school. But, through th magic of LDS, you now have 4 extra hours of your day you can work with.

this could be used in a variety of different ways. You could se it for extra sleep, which would probably allow you to perform better in class. or you could spend that extra time you now have pursing post High School opportunitys, such as collge, trade school, or a job. Alredy from time saved, your qaulity of life has been ffr and away bettered by a switch to LDS.

""but hold on"" some of you may be thinking, ""what if i dont live in a city or far away from my school?"". Than your simply not thinking about some of the more commonly applicable elements of such a system. for instance, how often has a student gotten sick and then proceeded to fall behind on classwok? Im sure the qauntity is staggering, but no longer! A student, even if they are sickly and bed ridden, can still participate in classroom activitys by observing and following along with the rest of his or her class.

And even throughing both of this vary well postulated examples to the metephorical wind, you can still find many reasons as to why such a system is benfical. Maybe a student is shy and would perfer a more, disconected aproach?

Perhaps a child cannot attend class due to a long family vacation? One thousand examples could be found in an instant as to why such a system is more than worth the investment by our school systems.

B7819FA33B21,"Summer assignments should be student-designed because students will understand the project better, they will actually want to do it, and it will be a more fun and creative way for the students to learn. These are the reasons why I believe summer assignments should be student-designed.

The first reason I believe summer assignments should be student-designed, is because students will understand it better. Since it was designed by the students, they will have a better understanding of what needs to be done for the assignment. If it was designed by a teacher, then the students may be confused about the assignment and will ask many questions. Students will also actually want to get it done. Since it was designed by the students, they will feel the need to get it done knowing its not just a burden put on them over the summer by the teacher, forcing them to work. Students will also not be able to use the excuse

""I did not know what to do."" Students will know what to do because it was designed by the students in the first place. This is what leads me to believe that summer assignments should be student designed, because students will have a better understanding of the project since it was created by them.

Another reason summer assignments should be student-designed, is due to the fact that students will actually want to get it done. If the assignment is designed by the students, it will appeal to them and they would take interest in it. If it was designed by a teacher, students will feel as if they have no choice in the matter, and must do as the teacher asks, thus removing the students interest from the assignment. Students will not feel as if they are having their summer taken away from them by the teacher, forcing them to do assignments. Since it was designed by the students, they would understand each other and know how much work would be too much, and what topics would appeal to them. This is why summer assignments should be student designed, because the students will actually want to get it done knowing they aren't being forced to do a project by the teacher.

A third reason why I feel that summer assignments should be student designed, is because it will be a more fun and creative way for the students to learn. They will enjoy doing the project because it appeals to them. Since it was designed by the students, they will find joy in doing it because it was created by them in the first place and wont feel as if they are being forced to do it by the teacher. Students will also understand that its not just another project designed by the teacher. Instead, its a fun and creative way to let the students have some fun while learning. They will be enthusiastic about the project because they know its not just a huge workload put on them by the teacher to ruin their summer. Students will also be able to ask their friends for help if needed, instead of having to ask the teacher how to do everything. This is why I strongly believe that summer assignments should be student-designed, because it will be a more fun and creative way for the students to learn and it will be more appealing to them.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that summer assignments should be student-designed. This is true because students will understand the assignment better since it was created by them, students will also feel the need to get it done,and lastly, it will be a more fun and creative way for the students the learn. ",0,0.006721935,0,True

Image you are in a classroom and an emergency occurs, and there is no one else to help you, what do you do? This is why cell phones are important to have at school. I am writing this letter to explain the importance of cell phones at school. I hope you take time out of your busy day to read my letter and take it into consideration.

First off, cell phones are not cheap. students also treat them like it is there child. would go nowhere without them. This information, I feel can teach good parenting skill for later on in life. students should keep them off in school, but they should be able to care them around like little children they will be able to have once they reach adulthood

Secondly, cell phones are a great way to communicate. This is a great way for students to communicate with other students all over the school. This would help students with studying and would make sure that no student is left out by his or her self. cell phones can be a great boost to self-esteem all over the school. This would reduce the amount of bullying and would give kids a real chance to make good life friends.

Lastly, if a emergency where to happen to a student at school. Other kids would be able to call for held if needed and would even save a kids life.

If a student would have a cell phone without emergency contact number, then they should not even be aloud to have a cell phone in the first place. So say one of your kids had an accident at school wound' t you want the to contact you.

I am writing this letter to you today to let you know I stroungly believe that we should demolish the process of electoral college. Why you may ask? First, it is unfair, we are the votes they not. Second, it is outdated (

""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer

) Lastly,

First, it is not fair. We the people are surposed to chose the president not some privite party that we never meet. According to ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer ;according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college- wor the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to kind we have now."" So we vote yes but he doesn't become president; do we even matter? It doesn't seem like it.

Second of all, it is very outdated. According to ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by The Office of the Federal Register this process was founded in the days of the four founding fathers. That's old! Now in days we have found better and fair ways to do pretty much every thing.

I hope this letter helps you decide on weather or not we should keep the process of electoral college.

493EF6BC8883,"Dear Principal,

It has come to my attention that you are considering banning cell phones in school. Please do not do this. Students have a right to talk to their friends even if they aren't face to face. As long as students don't use them during class, there is no harm in using them at all. Students can't do anything with cell phones out of class that they couldn't do without them. It just makes talking with friends easier.

What's the difference between allowing students to text their friends and allowing them to talk to their friends? Maybe if a person doesn't have the time to see his friends between periods, he can just text them instead. It doesn't do any harm as long as you don't allow them in classrooms. It's not like you can cheat outside of a classroom. If they were to pass on answers to a test they could do it even without cell phones.

If a student doesn't use cell phones during class, then there's no danger of cheating. Even so, it's very easy to tell when someone is cheating. I highly doubt that someone is going to have the exact same answers as his friend by pure coincidence. Also, most people don't have a habit of looking down at their lap then immediately writing down an answer. Cell phones reduce the danger of cheating while making it easier to catch cheaters.

Lets face it, it's human nature to do what we are not allowed to do. There's examples of that throughout history. If you disallow cell phones, it's going to make more people use them, and in ways they aren't supposed to. If you allow them, people will be much more willing to follow the specific rules since they are still able to use them.

So, I do hope you consider my appeal to you. Cell phones aren't a bad thing as long as they are used correctly. They reduce the risk of cheaters and make those that do easy to spot. And remember, if you do ban them, people are going to want to use them even more.",0,0.0066604204,0,True

Im against it because the laws, what wil happen after a accident, and how these things would actually work.

If the law focuses on how safety works and keeping everyone in the car safe, what if theres a malfunction and theres a accident ? Then who will get the blame for it ? The way it will work is if a human driver is in control right, but then the driverless car looses control or has a breakdown who will be affected ? The developer or the ones in the driverless car. The traffic laws are for someone to be in control of the car so therefore it is safe. Maybe a change in laws can solve this problem and conflict that may possibly happen.

Accidents happen daily, so will the driverless decrease the chances of that happening ? In my opinion is that technology goes wrong here and there not always but it happens. If these cars arent deveoped the proper way where theres accidents daily, who gets the blame. I personally think that the developer and the one who had the idea to make this should take a part in it. Why ? Simply because if you took the time to make something so cool and fun, it should also reach state safety laws. When accidents happen and if its the drivers fault they get blamed for it right ? So if this driverless car where there is no driver who get the blame for a injury, the driver or manufacturer.

How will this driverless car even work or be developed. The car is gonna have a sensor input system to take over when in traffic. Sensors arent really the best thing to have because something can cause it to stpo it from working then what happens there. If you still need to be in the driver seat and paying attention to the road what is the purpose of this developement ? It has its own brakes but you can take turns, but cant you do that in a normal car just takes alittle bit more time. This driverless car isnt a bright idea just because of the way it works and the problems it can cause.

Im against it because the laws, accidents and what can possibly happen, and the way this technology might take place. States are gonna have to change safety laws which in some the car needs to be proven to be safe. The accidents and the way things will be faced and who will be blamed is gonna be insane in most peoples opinion. The way technology might take place is also gonna be a factor because it can go wrong if not built right. Therefore im not so convinced about the developing on this driverless car.

84D827C2D12A,"What is summer to you? Warm air, blistering sun, hot sandy beaches, cool ocean water, hanging out with friends, freedom, no responsibilities? Or is it the dreadful summer assignment you are forced to do by your calculus teacher? Summer is a time to have fun and enjoy a needed break from the monotonous and boring school routine, not a time to be doing more schoolwork for the next year. It is understandable, summer is too long to go without doing at least a little bit of learning, however, wouldn't it be much more bearable to do a summer project on something you actually want to learn about? Summer projects should be student-designed because they should be able to pursue something they enjoy, teachers won't be available for help, and more students would complete the assignment on time.

Many students in this world don't find a need for what they learn in high school when they find a job in the real world. Generally, many students struggle to find something they enjoy in a class in high school, but are still forced to take them, resulting in little time to explore what they are really passionate about. So why should students be forced to do boring projects on for classes they don't actually like over the summer, when they are supposed to be given a break to relax from school and have fun? It would be much more beneficial and enjoyable for students to explore their interests during a time they aren't stressed with other schoolwork. Giving the students the opportunity to choose what they work on for their summer assignment could help immensely with steering students towards the right career path by having them choose something that they personally find interesting.

Summer is also a time for the teachers to be given a break from school. During the school year, many teachers are working the five days during the week at the school, then grading over the weekends on their own time for no extra pay. Teachers embrace the long break and release of stress that comes with the hot air of summer just as much as the students do, and the last thing on their minds is the summer assignments they gave to all of their students. With many projects, especially ones as big as the ones given out for summer assignments, students need the support of their teachers to fully understand what they have to do, and with teachers out of action for the summer, they will have trouble understanding what is being assigned to them and may struggle completing the project. If students were able to choose what their project could be on, they would choose something that they understand better and wouldn't need the help and support of their teachers.

Although summer assignments are usually required and meant to be worked on over the course of the summer, many students push it off until the last week or just don't complete it at all because of how much they really dread doing the work. Many teenagers in general will do the things they enjoy until they absolutely have to do the things they don't want to do. If the summer project is on something they don't want to do, a large majority of students would push it off until late August to start, which defeats the purpose of having a summer assignment at all. If students were able to choose what they wanted to work on for their summer projects, they would be more encouraged and motivated to complete the assignment on time and work on it throughout the summer rather than waiting until the last minute.

Summer should be a period that students and teachers alike should look forward to as a time to relax and be free from the constant stresses of school. They should enjoy themselves in whichever way suits them during this time and should be doing the things they want to do, not what they are forced to do. By letting the students choose to focus on the things they enjoy, summer can be what everybody wants it to be, fun for everyone.",0,0.0066462927,0,True

95ED30690B8C,"You can't always do it alone, and getting multiple opinions never hurts. When you have a problem, sometimes there's an obvious answer, but other times there isn't. When this happens people usually go to someone who's wiser and has more experience, and sometimes people go to their best friend for help. Why not do both? Getting advice from multiple people is the best thing to do if your stuck. Getting multiple peoples opinions on something could give you more choices, make you feel better about the choice you're going to make, and sometimes people give bad advice.

Multiple peoples advice can give you more choices. If you had more than 1 opinion you would have a broad mindset to help you make a good decision. Having a broad mindset sounds bad, but it's actually good. More choices means that you have thought of every outcome and can make your best decision. When you use someone else's advice you don't know if it's the right decision. From other peoples opinions you can form the best decision for you. better yet the decision came from you.

Advice from others can make people feel better about the decision they're about to make. People get nervous when making a decision; especially a big one. The more someone thinks of an answer, the less stressed out and nervous they get. When you think about the advice you get and create your own decision, typically clams people down because it's the decision they made and they're confident in it. Your decision is the 1 that matters most.

Getting advice from others is good, but sometimes people can give bad advice to try to throw you off. If you ask for advice from someone you don't trust always get someone else's opinion. In 1 episode of SpongeBob SquarePants, SpongeBob asked squidward if he should let Patrick, SpongeBob's best friend, babysit Gary, SpongeBob's pet snail. SpongeBob was going to celebrate his mom's house to celebrate her birthday. Squidward, knowing Patrick is an idiot said yes, and Patrick burnt down SpongeBob's house, and flooded it trying to take out the fire. The moral of the story is get a professional to babysit your pet snail, and to always get multiple opinions.

Seeking out multiple peoples opinions to help you make a decision can broaden your amount of choices, make you feel less stressed about the choice you're going to make, and get rid of the chance that someone tells you the wrong decision. Getting more than 1 opinion can help make the right decision, and your own decision. Other people's advice can help stress less about a decision. Sometimes people try to mess you up y giving you bad advice so you should always get multiple opinions. When someone needs to make a decision they typically ask for advice.

Also in the text it said that when a student is confused or bored it can tell that they are so the computer will give them a problem they understand. Plus if a student is having a bad day the computer can detect that so the teacher could ask the student if they need someone to talk to or if he or she needs to go chill out in the health office. the computer can tell that your mad, sad, or felling sick to your stomach because it reads the mucels in your face like when your eyebrows go up from getting suprised or how your cheek bones go up from smiling. Also the computer know the percentages of your feeling the computer can tell you that your 80% happy and that your 10% mad and your 10% bored.

The computer can also tell if you dislike the ad its showing so it wont show anything similar to it but if it shows that you like the ad the computer will put another ad similar to the one you smiled or laughed at. Dr. Huang and his colleague made this kind of computer so that we humans can have better computers and better ways to communicate with each other. So we would know if someone is mad, sad, or glad so we can help them out with what they are going through. But the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face. But all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Dr. Huang relises that Dr. paul Eckman creator of facial action coding system has classified six basic emotions like happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness then associated each with characteristic movments of the facial muscles.

plus the computer can also identify mixed emotions. the computer can also detect a painting of a face like Mona Lisa. Things like this that detect emotions can help schools parnets and friends to know whats going on with the person and so they can help. But one of the good things about it is that the things you see on the computer you like to see will have something similar to the ad or video you watch.

I hear you are considering not letting students participate in school sports or activities unless they have a grade B average. I personally do not agree with that decision. Over half the kids in this school have a C average and most of the players on any teams have a C average. Even some of the best.

The kids we have playing for are athletics teams and also other kids participating in other activities, are good at what they do. Remember we go to competitions and games and if we have all the good players kicked off the team just because their grades, then we'll have a bad team. We might not even be able to make it to regions on some of the sports we do! What will people think of SCHOOL_NAME athletic department then?

Kids need to get out and enjoy playing sports; it actually helps them do better in school with an exercised mind. Sure, some people say it's to much work trying to keep up with grades and a sport or activity but it's not. If adults can go and do a job, come home, cook dinner, and worry about kids and babies running around, then i think kid's can handle a sport and grades.

I can understand not letting kids participate in activities if there failing a class but just making a C average i don't understand that. Some kids might grow up to be famous athletes and might not need knowledge. Yes, they still need to try their best but some peoples best isn't enough to make an A or even a B. So i think we should still let those making C averages play and participate in sports and other activities, as long as their not failing any other classes.

39899C248BC7,"""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress."" There are 538 electors in the Electoral College. In order for a candidate to become President, a majority of 270 votes is required. I am in favor of the Electoral College because of the certainity of outcome and becouse of the states.

First, I am in favor of the Electoral College because of the certainty of the outcome. Because of the number of electors is even means that there could be tie. But, people don't understand that is very unlikely. As said in Source 3: In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President, ""A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible-it happened in 2000- but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote."" So, most of the things that people stress over about the Electoral College are very unlikely to hsppen.

Secondly, I am in favor of the Electoral College because of the states. Two types of states are big states and swing states. Big states are the states that have the largest population that ""the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance"" on. One of the other types of states are the swing states. Swing states use the winner-take-all method. Swing states don't vote for the President based on his or her political party. They vote for the President based on who they are or who they like better out of the candidates so you never really can know who they are going to vote for.

In conclusion, I am in Favor of the Electoral College because of the certainty of outcome and because of the states. The Electoral College have sources to rely on so that it won't fail.

Scientists say that in paragraph 12 ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-- landforms common around the American West"".

FEBFD34B8021,"In this reading, the author is talking about exploring venus, but all his evidence speaks differently. I believe the author does not support the clam that Venus is a worthy pursuit because the evidence given is mediocre. He contradicts himself in many paragraphs proving why we shouldn't send people over, and has not given any reason why we should go over there.

In this short persuasive article, the author does not pursuade at all. In paragraph two, the backround of Venus is given, but it's not stated why its important to visit this planet. ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size."" The only valid reason givin in this short story is when it is said in paragraph 4, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" This statement gives no reason for traveling and researching Venus except for the fact it used to be like Earth.

Though it is said Earth is one of a kind, this article states Venus is the most like Earth planet they've ever found. That could be a valid reason to explore and consider inhabiting, but it is proven with evidence that Venus is inhospitable and would serve no purpose in researching and visiting. In paragraph three, it is said, ""On the planets surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" These conditions are said to be inhospitable in paragraph four. It is also said, ""Such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our ocean and liquify."" This evidence says the planet is almost impossible to visit and collect data on, except in the fifth paragraph, it is a very long explanation as to how we could even study venus. This is then contradicted in the sixth paragraph by saying photography and videography are ineffective because of the thick atmosphere, and no samples would be possible because the ground conditions are too bad for humans, and even metal.

0B88C91C0403,"If you were a student in school with a lot on your plate, wouldn't you find it more beneficial to work from home instead? Students get stressed going to school everyday. Sometimes, they don't feel comfortable and they just want to get away to their homes. They'd rather attend class from home than going to school to attend classes. While although, that idea sounds nice, it's not beneficial to students. Most students wouldn't even bother to attend classes from home because they'll be distracted and that'll cause them to fail. It's more beneficial for students to attend classes at school because it'll help them concentrate and, the concentration will help them succeed.

Expanding on the idea of concentration, the students would have a higher concentration level if they attended classes at school rather than at home. For instance, they're less likely to be distracted by anything because the teacher would keep their attention on the class. The teacher's main objective is to keep the students engaged in to the subjects that they're teaching to them. The teachers could do that by having students participate in hands-on activities. Or, teachers could incorporate interesting videos and demonstrations in order to keep the students' attention level high. All together, if classes kept the students concentrated then, they'd feel like attending classes at school would be far more beneficial to them than attending classes at home.

Furthermore expanding on concentration, maintaining high concentration levels while attending class at school could push for a higher succession rate. This means that students are more capable of achieving their full potential while in the classroom than at home. To do this, the teachers have to maintain the concentration levels of the students and have to push them to produce the best work that they can. In a classroom environment, students would be more influenced to create their best bodies of work through the encouragement of teachers also. Through both high concentration, influence, and encouragement, the students will be able to pass with great success if they attended class at school. Therefore, this gives attending classes at school a more beneficial edge.

Now while students would benefit more from attending classes at school, attending classes from home also has it's perks. Students would be able to get more sleep in the morning instead of worrying about getting ready to attend class at school. Students would also be comfortable at home in their own environment rather than them going to an environment that's outside of their house. Now, as much as that sounds great, there are also a lot of distractions at home and negative perks with attending classes at home. The student could sleep in and not attend class at all that day. Them sleeping in would stem from being way too comfortable. It's nice to be comfortable but, being comfortable too much could make the student lazy. It's more beneficial for students to attend classes at school because the constant interaction and engagement would push them to be the best student they can be.

Overall, it's more beneficial for students to attend class at school. They would be concentrated through interactions with the class and being interactive will push the students to perform at their best ability. With that it'll create a high succession rate of passing students, making attending class at school more beneficial for students. While although it wouldn't be bad attending class from home, it's not beneficial because students would get too lazy and that'll cause them to fail.

3F2E569A486F,"What is the best method for a students education? Students will befit by being able to attend classes from home because students will have more options of class times, students will be less stressed, and students will have more personal time.

First, speaking from the point of view as a high school student or a college student, trying to find time for classes along with other activities can be difficult. Going to at least five or six classes a day, getting homework, then going to jobs or sports can be hard to manage, especially as a teenager. As a student if you are able to work from home and pick the time of your classes it may be more suiting to your schedule. As this type of activity is not made for everyone, it may find a way to be useful to every student such as the student can have classes when the teacher video calls the student or when the teacher has a planned class, while others may want to chose when this class happens and if it is by themselves or live with others. While any of these options are available students may even earn a better education at their own pace and their own time without the rush and stress of the surrounding world.

Next, a students stress level can go down by taking online classes. As today's modern society rises students have more mental issues than a mental patient in the 1920's. This is a very large issue that counties to grow, along with many other stressful events and even technology. Stress can cause many things like depression and anxiety, but how can schools help with this? While most high schools students worry about the future we want to find a way to help them stress less about these things. By giving the option to students of online classes, students are able to do what they want, when they want, and how they do it. This may allow students to become more open and not feel like they need to fight against others or themselves to be their best self. Students will be able to complete classes on their own time and learning does not have to be as difficult as it appears. By limiting big classes students may not be surrounded by others with a higher level than them and stress about how they are not good enough or need to be better in anyway.

Last, students would have access to more personal time. As mentioned before students will most likely have the option of when their classes are and when they do them, this can give the student more access to their own time and any activities. Students can focus on important things like sleep, health, jobs, and other activities then return to their school work at anytime and being able to feel comfortable with their choices without being told how and when to do them. Students having more time to relax or enjoy themselves without feeling the stress of school and homework on their chest gives the students the ability learn new things and test their minds on what they can really do.

By doing online class and giving students more choices and free time the student can learn time management skills and understand what needs to be done, when to get it, and how to complete these task daily.

In conclusion, students will befit by attending classes from home because students will have more options of class times and how they wish to mange their time and usage of the day. Students may become less stressed due to when given more options in schooling and learning on your own time at your own pace. Students will have access to more personal time and be able to learn new skills and enjoy themselves without the stress of the modern world.",0,0.006766859,0,True

Being to angry is bad for someone because it causes stress and anger issues that will later lead on to heath problems and car accidents, now if we reduce the number of drivers, or even come to a point where driving a car doesn't even exist anymore, the amount of angry people will be reduced, thus making the world a little bit nicer than it already is.

I believe that you can learn more if you are in a regular class than just being at home because students can learn from other cultures or more things about life with other friends, if students do not interact with others in a future they are going to be afraid to do it, and finally if you are in a regular school you can do more activities and share with your friends.

First, when you are in a school of the united states you learn a lot from other cultures. Therefore besides than world geography, you learn from your friends countries and how is to live there. Also, when you have friends at school you share your problems and most of the time you learn more things about life with them and how you can be a better person.

Second, sometimes there can be shy people at school because they do not know how to interact with others or how to start a conversation. When you do activities in groups sometimes you make new friends and talk to others became easily than before. However, if students do not learn how to talk to others in public places they are going to be afraid in a future; imagine if they need to make a presentation at work, they are not going to be able to do it because they will be afraid to talk in front of all the co-workers. Learn how to interact with others is important for your future.

Third, it is important to get involve in activities at school; activities help you with your curriculum when you apply to college. Also, if you are in any activity you can share more with your friends. However, when you get involved with activities at school helps you to clear your mind when you have to many homework or when you are stress out about your classes. Therefore, some of the activities give a lot of skills in the thing that you would like to do in your future.

In conclusion, if students do not interact with others or neither have a friend to talk with, and they do not have activities to get involved with other people; students are not going to be successful if they try in a future to interact with a large group of people. Therefore, it is very important to learn from others and interact at your school. That is why I believe that everybody should take classes on a regular school, to learn how to get involved with others and be able to express your self.",0,0.006877834,0,True

Astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may well once have been the most earth-like planet in the solar system because people from long time had to covered the oceans to support carious forms of life to them just how earth is from us today. Also because the value of the returning of the venus seem to be a little difficult but there was other option to make a mission to be safe and productive to both of them for the astronomers to be by venus and know the planets in the solar system.

Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosvie sulfuric acid in venus's atmosphere because they think that the challenging for venus might not be working for them but now they do work because the conditions are now more extreme then any human encounter out there and all of the environment can crush of a submarine. But then venus has the hottest surface temperature to any of the planet in the solar system that their is even when mercury is close to the sun venus can still be hot for the system being beside another planet.

Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely. Venus can be the closest planet to earth even in terms of size and density. Also each of the previous mission can have an unmanned and for a reason no sacecraft has been survived for the time of landing for more than hours or even minutes. Venus had more than three decades, but venus reputation for a challenge planet is for humans to work on and study for and to despite the proximity to it.

D8824F42C5CF,"Dear Florida state senator,

In few words, the United States should keep the Electoral Collage. Although the people may not depend on them, it does not mean that they are dependable either. The United States may have a long process of voting for a president for the country that in which only they can choose rather than the people, but it still is being done for the good of the countries' future.

The process for gaining a president may be long and not allow the peoples' voices to matter, but the future of the country cannot be placed on their unreliable descisions. Not all of the people are experienced on the ways of the government as the Electoral College or the House of Representatives are. In truth, you may never know that if a certified member of any one of the states is actually on the side for the greater good of the country. An enemy country may pay for any large number of citizens to elect a certain candidate that could be working for them. This could happen with the Electoral Collage. They may be paid by an organization working against the U.S. or by one of the candidates themselves for personal gain. But even if it did happen, as it claims in Source 1, by the Office of the Federal Registar, there would be the House of Representatives to also give the last vote if there were to be a tie. Source 3 states that there is an equal number of electors  which gives every state a chance of getting in the matter of equally electing a candidate for president.

Many things could happen while there is a new president to be elected. As I said before: the Electoral College may be paid to pick one candidate for president over the other. Source 2, by Bradford Plumer, states that the Electoral College has its defenses. Some of its members may be replaced in a state for that states' personal gain in the matter. Even so, it would be hard to tell. For the most part, it is the unfairness of not counting the peoples thoughts and opinions. It is their country as well!

All in all, it is very unreliable to put trust in the people, or anyone, for voting a president. Not many people may like the Electoral College, or their final descision, but even then it is the best way of getting a fair vote on a president. They will be there to select the new future of the country, besides being their job to do so, as opposed to the American people having duties elsewhere. They may want a candidate over the other, but even then by the end of the day, they would be in the same square they were on even before there was to be a new president elected. Even so, if there is a change in their style of living that they frown upon, they can always alert Congress.    ",0,0.0071197394,0,True

Students look forward to their summer break because they dont have to do anything. Well teachers want them to continue learning during their break. If the kids were able to choose what they want to do on the project, they would actually do it unlike if the teachers chose a boring project. Kids are embellish and like to do their own thing.

96FFE19CBFB8,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars. As driverless cars are becoming a new deveoping technology, it's best to ask yourself, ""Are driverless cars really a necessity?"" The answer is, no, they are not a necessity for many reasons. We should not continue to develope driverless cars mainly because; driverless cars are not completely driverless, the car would need a new built-in entertainment system to put inside of the car, and if something were to go wrong with the car, who is to blame for this?

When you hear the words, ""driverless car"" what comes to mind? Perhaps, you think of a car that can take you anywhere, and young teens the age of thirteen not needing an adult to drive them to a desired destination. However, driverless cars are not 100% driverless. In the article, the cars are said to be able to steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, because of this an alert driver is said to still be required. People are still needed to be able to navigate through work zones and around accidents. Manufacturers are still working on creating new ways to alert the driver when human skills are needed, but it is no secret that this will continue to cost money.

Another reason why we should not have driverless cars, is because to have them, companies think a built-in entertainment system should be created, installed and required inside of all driverless vehicals. Today, we already have vehicals that contain a television inside for the passengers who occupy the back seats, to help keeped them entertained. This new entertainment system is said to shut off when the car needs the driver to take over and will not be available to a driver who is texting or using their phone in any way. However, putting in an entertainment system would still be considered a distraction, just the same as if someone were to be using their phone, and the article states drivers will need to remain alert, but they can not remain alert with an entertainment system.

Finally, we should not have driverless cars because, if an accident were to occure, or if something fails, who is to bame for this issue? There are situations where we would not know who to blame, the driver or the manufacturer. We could blame the driver, stating that they should have been paying attention and been alert to stop the accident before it occured. However, we could also blame the car's manufacturer, because they were supposed to build the car and make sure it was not able to fail in the first place.

As you can see, driverless cars could bring more trouble to us than we realize. They are not a necessity, we do not need to use driverless cars as our dominant way of transportation. The article states many positives and negatives aspects of the development of driverless cars.

6ECD533A72F4,"Driverless cars are the transportation system of the future. Their benefits greatly outweigh those of the current system. Driverless cars are easily possible to develop, much safer than regular cars, and have benefits for both people and the environment.

Driverless cars are already in development, and many manufacturers have already designed and created the technology which makes them possible. Driverless cars require sensors which allow them to mimic human reaction to whatever situation might arise while on the road. Sensor technology has been in development and in use since the 1980s, with the introduction of antilock brakes. Using this technology, Google modified a Toyota Prius with several sensors which allows the car to access a 3-D model of its environment. The proper technology to introduce driverless cars is clearly already available to manufacturers. In fact, in 2013, BMW announced the ""Traffic Jam Assistant,"" which allows the car to steer, accelerate, and brake itself. The world is already well on its way to the creation of a truly driverless car.

Some might object to the safety of driverless cars, but in reality, driverless cars introduce more safety to the road environment. An operating system or machine cannot become tired, frustrated, emotional, angry, or distracted in any way; its judgement is mechanical, and there are no variables of human unpredictability. Most if not all vehicular accidents are caused by some sort of human error in judgement, and driverless cars eliminate this possibility, which is conducive to a much safer driving environment. A possible cosumer concern might be that with the current model of semi-driverless cars, which still require some human effort, people may get tired or distracted waiting for their turn to drive. However, manufacturers are developing an answer to this concern which introduces more safety than a regular driving environment would have. Some manufacturers are introducing in-car displays which turn off instantly when driver assistance is required, which is not possible with a regular cellphone or messaging device. This eliminates any in-car distraction during the driving task, With human error eliminated, driverless cars are much safer than regular ones.

Finally, the driverless car introduces benefits to both people and the environment. Driverless cars can allow people to safely engage in other activities besides driving, allowing them to achieve and accomplish more. Driving can be tiring, and driverless cars eliminate driving as a task for people to complete. Many factors can impair driving ability and prevent one from driving, but with driverless cars, mobility is always possible, and transportation is always accessible. A Google cofounder estimates that driverless cars can eventually eliminate the need for personal cars at all, by introducing a public transportation system of entirely driverless vehicles, and that these vehicles can use half the fuel of current taxis. This can have huge benefits for the environment.

Driverless cars are a much better alternative to the transportation systems of today. They can and are being devleoped, carry benefits to the environment and to people, and are much safer than regular cars.",0,0.55227035,1,False

The Electoral College is a process not a place. When the founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and also a popular vote of approved citizens. That should stay remain the same they should not be any change to the Electoral College system.

The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electorals. When the electors have a meeting thats when they are able to for the President, Vice President that is running for office. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors, majority of 270 electoral vote, is to elect the President. Each state is entitled allotment in its Congressional delegation which means one for each member in the House of Representives plus two for your Senators.

Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated three electors and are treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. Each candidate that is running in the election has their own group of electors, generally chosen by the candidate's political party. The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The voters help choose their state's electorals when they voted for the President, when they vote for the candidate they are actually votin for the candidate's electors. Voters are more likely to pay attention to the efforts the candidate put to win the election like the campagin.

The Electoral College system has a method called ""winner- take-all that awards all the electors to the winning presidental candidate. After the presidental election the state governor will prepare a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" that which list all the of the candidates that ran for office, along with the names for their respective electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winner of the presidental candidate of your state. The Certificate of Ascertainment is sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the offical records of presidential election.                      ",0,0.0072932225,0,True

Another good one is you can go sightseeing while shipping or going on the land you shipped something to like how Luke did when he went to Europe.

Another point of fun you could have while being a seagoing cowboy is after you shp the animals off of the boat or ship when the animals are gone it can clear up some room for you and any friends you may or may not have made. What I mean is after the animals are gone you can use the extra room for games,messing around,and even spending time with friends you may have made.

The reason being because it gives students a chance to choose how they wanna learn and which way works best for them. By giving students this opportunity, it could mostly likely engage students to learn. It gives them more then one option to choose from.

Many students around the world have probably been in a situation where they couldn't have one on one time with a teacher. Therefore, it caused them to do bad on a test/quiz or even fail. By giving students the option to video conference, it gives students a chance to ask more questions and to be more clear on things they don't understand. Everyone has a different pace on how they learn and process new information.

Another reason why it would be beneficial is because some students are born with disabilities or they can't walk as good. So for them it might be harder to get to places or even do anything. Which is why I think online classes are a good idea, because it doesn't allow them to do much. But they're still getting the same amount of education as someone who does go to school.

One of my last reasons are because of bullying. Bullying is one of the most common things to happen at school. The reasons people bully are because of how someone looks/dresses and if they're dumb or not. That being said, online classes are a good way for kids that get made fun of, to still get the same learning experience as others, just without the hurtful comments or actions.

I respect other peoples point of view by thinking they won't really benefit from anything. Because if you think about it, some students will take advantage and use it to their own power. Some students will go as far to cheating so they could have a good grade. Which at the end will be bad for them because they won't benefit from anything. However, they won't get to do school activities such as school dances, pep rallies and even get to watch sports games.

When asking for advice, people may think ""Well I really don't trust that person."" , ""Their culture may say different from what I believe."" or they may think ""That person has gone through more than other people."" . So, I believe we should go to one and other to seek advice because of different personal opinions,different trust levels, and how there culture may handle it.

My first reasons is, many people have different aspects of certain situations because they might have went through it. Also, people may say you should do one thing but, they may have an other opinion for someone else because it may be different then your situation. Like when I had to tell my dad I lost my watch, I asked several people if I should tell him or not.

In our world today people have made it hard for people to trust one and other. So, if you don't trust one person you may not seek for their advice as you would seek for friend or family. Although, someone may trust one and other doesn't mean they would agree with their opinion. For an example, I wouldn't go up to someone I don't trust or like and ask them "" Should I dye my hair blue."".

While car companies are helping by rolling out hybrid and electric cars, those cars are very expensive! Not everyone is willing to shell out that kind of money. By reducing car use, the harmful gases polluting our air will greatly decrease and places like Paris,France and Beijing, China both ver heavily polluted places can have clearer air.

Money. Money seems like it rules our world and it really does. Do you enjoy throwing money away? Of course you don't! Well, if you drive a car everywhere you go, you might as well be. Gas prices are high and it takes upwards of 50 dollars to fill the tank of the average car. Not to mention the price of the car itself! While you have to pay for gas, car insurance, maintenance, and the bill for the car if it's not paid off yet, people who walk to work or to the store and don't own a car are saving thousands of dollars a year.

To conclude, when you reduce the use of cars you: reduce stress, reduce the amount of pollution, and save money. If you want to leave the planet Earth healthy and livable for the future generations, you should seriously consider ditching your car and buying a nice pair of walking shoes.",0,0.98477143,1,False

This a one time offer. You don't know how long this opperation will be running. When my friend asked me to do I thought, ""I knew this was an opportunity of a lifetime."" I decided I am going to go. You should go too.

Another reason you should go is that you travel all over the world. You get to see things that you would never imagen. The places were unbelieveble.

D5474D29854A,"Having to stay after school without a choice, right after an eight hour stressing school day is the very definition of miserable, is what some might say. Students should be able to choose whether or not to participate in activities that are extracurricular. Extra curricular activities are activities that are extra, not required. Requiring students to participate in extracurricular activities should not be done because activities should not be forced, students already spend eight hours a day at school, and don't have the time or transportation.

Extracurricular activities are activities that are supposed to be extra. Having to require that all students do one, is taking away the definition of the word. Activities should be done of free will, not by force. Students may be stressed having to do something that they did not want to do or do not even care about. Extracurricular activities are out there for people who want to do them, not for those who do not want to. Students participating in something that do not enjoy or care about, is apathy. They do not care about the activity which causes a negative aura around those who do care about the activity.

Students on average spend eight hours a day at school, five days a week for about eight to nine months with holidays included. Eight hours in one thirds of a day, leaving only about sixteen hours left. Another eight of those hours goes to sleep and the rest to free time. Out of those eight hours of free time, one or more of them goes to preparing for school, then another for homework, and some for chores. After calculating it, in truth students only have about four or less hours of free time to themselves. Like all people, students want to be able to do what they want. They have dreams and goals that they want to achieve, but it does not mean that it is school related. Requiring students to take part in extracurricular activities that they do not want to do is not justified. Students deserve to enjoy themselves and have free time. They work hard on assignments at school and learn, they deserve a break. It doesn't just apply to the students, teachers too, have time that they want to spend on other things. In order for such extracurricular activities to work, a teacher will be required as a monitor.

In order for students to participate in extracurricular activities, students need transportation. Some schools do offer transportation, although it is only on certain days. Many extracurricular activities require students to show up after school, some on days that there might not be the transportation that they need. Finding someone to take you to school or where the extracurricular activity can take time.

Force, time, and transportation are some of the reasons on why extracurricular activities should not be required. Instead, they can be made as an extra credit grade, which will make more students want to do them. This way, students will not be doing it by force, but by their own decision, and the principal does not have to worry about students not participating in extracurricular activities.",0,0.006765398,0,True
6049a24f,"Presidential election is held every after four years on the first Monday of the month November. We decide who's going to be our next leader, the President. Electoral College is kind of unfair for some people because they think that whoever got the most popular vote should be President. But to think, what if the people we vote to is not right to be the next President and shehe got that most popular vote? Wouldn't that be a disaster? I say we should keep the Electoral College.

Electoral College process in consists of the electors that have been selected by the people. The ones who got selected are the ones with great intelligence and with great sense of leadership. In the first passage it mentioned that ""The Electoral College has a total of 538 electoras and the majority of electoral votes are required to have 270 electoral votes."" This means that for you to be one of the candidates you atleast have to have 270 electoral votes and this is a good way of picking our candidates to run for us for President.

Remember the election between Obama and rodney? It was close but, not that close. Our President, Obama got 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to 51.3 percent of the popular votes for him and Romeny. Almost of every states electoral votes is on a ""winnertakeall"" basis. For every slight of plurality in each of the states, it creates a ""landslide electoralvote"". This means that a tie would be possible because the number 538 votes is uneven but, it's mostly not to happen and this is because of Electoral College.

Electoral College avoids the problem of which didn't receive a majority of the votes. In passage three it gave an example about how Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had 43 percent only in pluraity of the popular votes and the winning number of the Electoral College is 301 and 370 electoral votes. Because of Electoral College the pressure that happens in electing the next President to lead us for four years is reduced and it also tells us which is the winner of the election.

If we elect our President using popular votes it migh be a disaster. Because not all of the candidates are that great of leading the whole country and If heshe got selected to be our next leader for the next four years our country would be in a huge chaos. I slightly agree with electing that person and making himher the next President because they got the most popular votes but, then again I don't think it's the right way of picking our new leader.",0,0.007060809,0,True
D4AA8EC389C6,"School Grades:

I don't think that it is fair to have a B average just to play a sport. It should stay the way it is now, at a C average. It would be hard to have a B average if your a kid that struggles just to keep your C. Could you imagine what it would be like to try and make a B average? It would be a horrible struggle. C' s are passing grades, but I do understand that a B' s better. But some kids are happy with a C. They shouldn't change it to make higher grades, they should make it to where the kids that have more trouble with the school work can try and make it to a C. Because, in my school some of the kids that are amazing in there sport. Are not so good in school work. They struggle with the work they have to do. I know its not all about winning, but another thing is that if you made the higher demand and make it a B. Than most of those kids wont be on the team, and sometimes you need those kids to help your team. I would completely understand that if you had a D or F. And couldn't play on the sports team. Because D' s and F' s are failing grades. t. I would think about trying to make it a higher grade average, just a little more. And get the understanding that most of America's students are C average people. An that the sports teams would go down, as the grade average gets higher. Yes educations is better for you, and playing sports is a gift. But, lets say that we change it to a B average. An all the great players on the team have to quit or get taken off because of the grades. Than they can't play another sport. So they will start not caring about there body weight, so then they become obese. And that's another thing people in America are struggling with. Overall I don't think its a very good idea to make it a higher grade to play a sport.",0,0.006944427,0,True
309BE8E1DCF1,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I disagree with the idea of only letting students with B grade average or higher only being allowed to participate in schools sports. It is unfair to all the other students that were one point off from a B point average or those who didn't get those A' s or B' s. It will make all the other students fell left out, or feel like they're being excluded. I find this new idea unfair and I don't want it to become a rule of school.

To start, it can make these students that didn't make a B grade point average feel like they're being excluded. ""Don't exclude, you should always include."" This is what teachers have told my fellow students and I for years. I think it is unfair to not let everyone compete in sports. These students that didn't get A' s or B' s may be the people who always wanted to compete in sports, but never had thought to join or never had the guts to stand up and join the teams, but if you introduce this new rule, then they don't even get a chance to try. I think this new rule is unfair and it shouldn't be kept.

Also, not everyone is perfect in school, and not everyone gets all A' s and B' s. I've had only a few C' s, but the rest of my grades were always A' s and B' s. One little C could ruin any students chances of competing in school sports and representing their school. I don't think schools should judge kids on their grades by letting the grades decide if a student can participate in sports or not. according to this new rule, a student can have all A' s and one C, but it's not the A' s that matter then, it's that one little C. Don't let this new rule prevent any student from competing in sports.

Lastly, sports provide any student with what they always need, confidence and exercise. If you let a student's grade decide if a student can or can't compete in sports, you can be holding them back from healthy exercise and keep them from building confidence. Exercise keeps students healthy and when a student competes in sports, they are exercising. Every gym teacher I've ever had has always told us how daily exercise is important and I've seen many commercials that say growing kids and teens need at least one hour of exercise each day to keep physically fit and healthy. Sports also build confidence. When a team wins, it boosts a person's confidence. When you are confident, you feel that you can do anything and succeed. Sports provide healthy exercise and confidence to students, but if you keep this rule, you'll be depriving it from us.

So what do you think? Do you want to exclude students and make them feel like they're not good enough to participate in sports? Do you want to deprive us from healthy exercise and confidence? Please consider the consequences of keeping this new rule. I feel it is unfair and I strongly disagree with it. I don't want anyone to feel left out or worthless when it comes to sports, but do you? Thank you for your time in reading this letter. i hope you consider the consequences.

To being with, limiting the use of cars can be very good for our enviornment because it would make the air less polluted. As stated in source 2 paragraph 5,""congestion was down 60 percent in the capitol of France, after five days of intensifying smog..."" thats a big percent and with that we are making the earth green. France even tried to ban cars even and odd to reduce the pollution as being talked about in paragraph 2 and 3. They were being fined if they drove, that is atleast until the air cleared up.

On the other hand, banning cars or not driving is a silly decision. It may be good for our earth and our health, but if you need to leave three hours before hand to reach your destination on time, then you need to buckle up and step on the gas. If gas so so bad for the enviornment, then why dont we ban gas cars? There are many indrustries and or companys that have created electronic cars. Charging our cars many be difficlut for long road trips but there could be a slot for gas for when our battery level is running low we can get some gas to reach a destination and charge it.

Having fellow citizens limiting car usage can have many advantages, but also a few disadvanteages. Cars can clean up the air but also make us gasp for it. Having a car should be a choice we get to make. Having events and days where ""no cars can be driven or you get a fine"" is not needed in anybodys lives.

9AEEADD5997A,"Did you know that 94% of students that participate in extracurricular activities do better later on in life than students that do not do extracurricular activities? All students at Generic_School should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Extracurricular activities can be beneficial to students health. Another reason is that students would socialize with other people through the activities. One more reason is that new skills and techniques can be learned. This shows that it is important for students to participate in extracurricular activities.

The participation in extracurricular activities can improve and keep students health in good condition. Sports help improve the health of the students that participate in them because the students in them usually have to attend practices and games, which will most likely involve physical activity. Also, extracurricular activities can improve the mental health of students because the person participating will probably have fun, which makes them happier. One more reason is that the activities might make the people participating in them feel better about themselves, which can make their health and well being improve. If you want to improve your health, then you should think about joining a team, club, or other group.

Students that join teams or groups are more likely to be more social than people who aren't apart of a team or group. Joining a extracurricular activity can help the student make new friends that have the same interests as the student. Also, teams and groups usually require socialization, so everyone gets to know each other. Good socialization skills can help students in the future and when they go out in public because it will make them less awkward around people and more pleasant to talk to. Extracurricular activities can also help the students participating gain popularity and be more likable because they become known by more people and can be liked for what they are good at. This is why the socialization within extracurricular activities is a beneficial thing to a lot of students.

One last reason why extracurricular activities are a great thing for students to participate in is that new things can be learned through the activity. Useful skills can be acquired through the things taught by the people running the activity. The skills learned through the activity could be useful throughout that person's life. Also, lessons can be learned through the interactions with others and the actions that the student did. One last thing is that techniques on how to do things better can be learned. The things learned through extracurricular activities can be helpful throughout a person's life and can impact the way they do things in a positive way.

All students at Generic_School should join at least one extracurricular activity. Activities outside of school can improve the student's physical and mental health. Also, the socialization skills of a student can be improved because of the sports or clubs they're apart of. One final reason is that new things can be learned through the activities the student is involved in. This is why it is important for students to be apart of at least one or more extracurricular activities.",0,0.0076676705,0,True
0bbff1f5,"Why are the streets always so jammed!? Everyone asks that all the time almost everyday around 5:00pm. The reason for is because cars being excessively used nowadays. There are several different advantages that can happen when limiting car usage. The world would be a better place if less cars were used on the roads.

To begin with, why do we the people use cars? The reason is because it can get us from A to B really fast. But that's only 1 positive for the usage of cars. Think about the negatives and disadvantages of using cars. My 1 main reason of the usage of cars is that it make the world less active. Walking or running is a daily form of exercise, and the usage of cars is limiting the numbers of that. In section 1 redrum Walter says that he always was tense when he had a car, he's much happier without one. This is why we should limit the usage of cars. We don't want the people to be tense all the time, we want them to enjoy and relax when using transportation other than cars. Walking will take longer but is better in the long run. You don't have traffic jams, you can go places and areas that cars couldn't fit through and you have many different ways of getting to a particular place rather than just a road. The only repercussion that you have to worry about with walking is the rain. But heres the thing, In section 3 Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus said ""The rain hasn't stopped people from participating."" This means rain isn't a problem when walking on the streets. Cars may offer more protection but its more dangerous than walking. This is why places like Germany, Paris, and Bogota are trying to carry out the experience of a ""carfree"" life.

In addition, another advantage of limiting car use is limiting riots. I know we have all heard of people screaming and arguing in the cars of people in front or behind them. This is a big problem nowadays and it's because of the use of cars. If we can limit the usage of cars than we can hopefully reduce the level of aggrevation on the streets. Alot of accidents happen everyday dealing with the usage of cars. Cars provoke alot of deaths if you think about it. If we could limit the usage of driving cars than this will limit the amount of deaths per year by cars. That's the number 1 disadvantages to the using of cars. Walking and biking are my 2 favorite types of transportation because it's smooth, and it's more conveinant. Less accidents and injurys happen when walking or riding a bike. This can also help the streets be less packed which will allow for easier access to certain places. DUI is the main worst tragic that comes from the usage of cars. Many people die everyday because of drunk drivers and thats not respectable. Just imagine if the same person who caused an accident in the car while drunk was drunk on the streets while walking, he more than likely couldn't of caused an accident if he was walking and not driving a car. Just think about all of the disadvantages that cars promote.

Last but not least, comes the president Barack Obamas most valuable reason to limit car usage. Obama wants to curb the U.S greenhouse gas emissions, and by that he wants to get fewer cars on the road. In section 4 it shows that ""studies suggest that americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" This means that Obama's goal is prevailing. Paris came to a conclusion that they decided to ban driving due to smog. In section 2 it states that Paris air became so polluted that they enforced a parial ""driving ban"" to get rid of the air pollution. They blamed this problem due to the diesel fuel. They figured out that diesels make up 67% of vehicles in France, as to 53% in the rest of Western Eurpoe. In section 2 its pretty much the same reason except Bogota's goal is to ""promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. The violators faced 25 fines."" They figured limiting car usage was a good opportunity to take away stress and reduce air pollution. In section 4 the last paragraph tells you what Bill Ford plan was. He wanted to create cities in which ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial, and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, onserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."" These are some advantages of less car usage. Many good things will start to happen if everyone could lower the usage of cars nowadays. We don't want the world to have polluted air, we don't want to promote car accidents, and we also don't want under age drivers on the streets. So take in mind the disadvantages of usage of cars and compared the to the the advantages of limiting car usage.",0,0.0065845205,0,True

Paragraph 1 The electoral college is made of 538 people called electors, these people are there to take in consideration what the people voted and then they them selves vote physically for the President of the United States. The electoral college is good because there is not as much controversy and if its been fine for this long it would not be changed now.

controversy, a big word with lots of meaning, but what does it really mean in this context. It is when two or more things are being argued about, in this case two political veiws. Whether or not we should keep the electoral college or get rid of it and go back to popular vote for electing the President of the United States. Having a little bit of controversy is good but the reason why the founding fathers made this into the constitution is to stop the out rages arguing that was going on when electing the First president. It states in paragraph 3 ,""The electoral college consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president."" This shows that they didnt just make it to please one side of the argument, this pleased both side because it was very fare and didnt favor one side to the other. By doing this it nearly ended all of the arguing and controversy, which that is what they wanted to accomplish.

furthermore, the electoral college is good because why would you change something that has been working perfectly and helped the voting process out tremdously over hundreds of years. They have had voting for the President down to a science now, for example,""The presidential election is held every four years on the tuesday after the first monday in november."" paragraph 6 Everyone in the U.S. knows this date, it is imprinted in our brain when that day is and we need to clear our calenders and turn on the grill because that is a very specail day of change for our beautiful country.

Many people say there are problems with the electoral college, then again there are problems with everything in this crazy world we live in. ""The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century."" paragraph 11 Yes there was a crisis but to say that the electoral college is corupt and bad just cause of that fiasco is to far. America is too strong to break down from just that and there are to many belivers in the electoral college to have it just fall to peices from that one problem. It also shows the resliency of the electoral college, and not just that but also showing changes so that those crisises wont ever happen again. ""Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors..."" That is living proof that there are changes and fixes being made to further the effiency of the Electoral College.

3D7B1F039322,"There are many ways to learn new things, through experience, being taught, and a multitude of other ways to obtain new information. School is the perfect place to learn new things from teachers that have extensive experience in their specific area of expertise. It is the teacher's and administration's job to help provide a well-rounded education for their students and part of that is assigning work that the students do not want to do. Summer projects are important so the students continue to use their brain and learn how to retain information. Teachers should design the projects because they know the material, have experience making lessons and projects, and the obvious fact that if it was student designed then the work would be almost non-existent.

Teachers have the education and knowledge about their class subjects; therefore, they know the material required by the curriculum for what is needed to be taught. In order to become a teacher, one has to go to college and earn a degree along with a teaching license and certification. Years of studying and mastering the material provides them with the tools needed to teach their students the subject. Students go to school in order to learn. If they do not know the material, how do they have any qualifications to design a project that would make sure that they learned everything required by the school district, state, or country? People go to school in order to become teachers because they want to help their students learn and grow. Not only is it the subject the teachers are teaching to them, but life skills and tools they can use in the future. If all the work that the students did was up to them, they would lack important skills like researching and communication that could help them in internships and the work world.

Students learn better from different ways and as a teacher, they have to be able to provide multiple ways to present information that makes sense to their students. Charts, flip charts, and simulations are all used by most teachers to show information that is important. In the summer, students aren't going to want to do homework regardless but if the project is set up with clear and concise directions, it makes the work seem less daunting otherwise. For example, if a student had planned a project, the project would only make sense to them because they are responsible for planning it out and the steps needed. When that transfers onto paper, other students won't know what is happening in the brain of the student who created it and will be confused.

In high school, students tend to do the bare minimum. If students were given the opportunity to create their own summer assignment, it would most likely end up being under 5 questions with minimal work needed to be done in order to complete it. This does not help the students in any way, shape, or form. Teenagers look for the quick and easy results that aren't as available as they think in the real world. The point of high school is to prepare you for college. If the work you do in high school is easy and not challenging there is a greater risk for those students to struggle more in college with the huge increase in course work. There are some students who crave the challenge and look for the ability to better themselves.

If they had the opportunity to create their own project it would be beneficial to them because they are willing to put in the work. Teachers can't trust that all students are like that though because each kid is different and most likely, when given the chance, the student will take the day to go to the pool rather than sit at home and do their own research about Stem Cell research.

Education, is in the hands of each individual and what they choose to make of it is up to them, but teachers should be there to guide and educate their students into making the right choices with their education. Although at the time, their students might respond to the summer assignment with a groan, it is in their best interest to do the work assigned to them by their teacher. Summer projects should be created by their teachers instead of themselves because teachers know what is important and they know what tools and resources to use in order to learn something new. Students have to realize that teachers want what is best for them and want them to be able to succeed in life.",0,0.0070119314,0,True
B6277B39C0BA,"Students are entitled to their own opinion. Restricting students and pushing them into things will not help them or the school. Students should have a choice of what they want to spend their own time doing, not their principle. They need to have that freedom or they will grow up relying on teachers and adults telling them what to do. Students need to be given the choice of joining in extracurricular activities instead of being forced into them.

All students have different types of interests, that may not line up with many others. Just because half of the school enjoys soccer, it does not mean that the everyone enjoys it to. Students enjoy doing activities that they find fun or intriguing. If they are forced into doing a specific activity they don't like, they will not try and will make it a miserable time for the others. Taking the students freedom of choice will not help them gain anything. Putting a student on the debate team will not make him enjoy debating, but may cause him to dislike it instead. If the students are given the choice of joining an extracurricular or not, more students would want to sign up. Being forced into doing things will not make students want to do it, but will cause the opposite.

Many kids with working parents have no way of leaving their school or getting there extra. The principal and the school will just suggest carpools but many students don't live near someone they know or can ask for a ride. School buses will not come out to a students house at 5pm every Wednesday for the student to go to the Math Olympiad meeting for one hour and then get another ride from the school buses back home. Many students take the bus for the exact reason of working parents, but if they don't have any way of getting there then students can get in trouble for things that are out of their hands. Students with available parents who can drive their kids can sign up for extra curricular activities. However, the students with no choice and no ride are different. Making the students do activities to boost the schools ratings and awards will only do harm to students. Freedom must be given to the students in events like this, because it is not under their control and would only make them more embarrassed.

Students get stressed out over just school itself. The students that may take longer to finish homework or projects may not have time to fit in sports clubs that they don't even like. Requiring students to take time out of their day to do activities they don't want to will only put more stress on them. They will have to spend extra time at school in an interest group they know nothing about, to go home and have to rush through homework and stay up late to finish that project they have due at the end of the week. Students could lose sleep and be more tired during the day, and even cause their mental health to decrease. When exams start and teachers begin to pile on the workload, students begin to struggle. When the principle then adds a new activity for them to do, leaving them less time to study and work, they can get stressed, start to believe things about themselves because they cannot finish the homework, and become sleep deprived from trying so hard. If that kind of mindset continues for too long, they will just stop trying overall. A students mental health should be important to the school and forcing them to do things that will decrease their mental health will make a bad school environment. The school should have their back, not pushing it into the student counsel.

A large of students already participating in out of school activities may not have the time for school activities. Students belonging to an indoor soccer club could have practice after school every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday and have football every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. These students may have learned the task of time management, but they most certainly have not learned how to be in two places at once. If no groups meet in a time where they do not have practice, then they cannot come. These clubs he is enrolled in out of school cost money and they already paid for the whole year. Schools cannot prevent you from joining in on activities they promoted you to do before they made the rule of joining an extracurricular. Students may be an excellent soccer payer and play for the best team out of their club, but not want to join the school team because a middle school soccer team will not get you recognized for a scholarship like a professional club will. Students choose to do different activities in and out of school for a reason. The students that have the right amount of time, are interested in those clubs, and will put in the amount of effort actually needed for the club will make the school environment better than the principal and teachers forcing kids into activities they don't have the time or effort to do.

In all schools, students should have freedom to do what they want. Students do not enjoy being talked into things nor do they like being forced into them. Schools do not know what may be going on in different students lives, mentally or physically. Leaving them the option to consider what would help them in their lives at that time, is important. Students always want more opportunities to improve, but these extracurricular activities may not be the type of opportunity they know will help them. They can always ask teachers and adults about the activities, but that does not mean they have to do it. Principles do not personally know all the students and have no way of knowing what is best for all of them. The students know themselves better than anyone else would, so only they can make the decision of what would be the best use of their time to help them improve as a person and a student. If students believe that school extracurricular activities would benefit them the most, then they can easily join. But it is not the same story for every student. Every student has a different life and a different mind. ",0,0.0070408084,0,True

When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. Seeking out multiple opinions can help someone make better choices, for it influence them to do better, , and many people most likely have experience.

To begin with, humans will follow anything if they are influenced by it. In this time and age, lots of human's opinions matters to others. For example, Generic_Name made a really bad choice, and asked her friend for help. Her friend gave there opinion to her and Generic_Name is now making better choices.

Also, people like to get different intakes on things. They wanna see what other people think, and how they would do it. Just one person's advice might not be enough. For instance, Generic_Name got a F on her test, and chose not to tell her father. She asked Generic_Name and Generic_Name what she should do, Generic_Name said, ""tell your father, for he will help you, and maybe even find a tutor for you."" While Generic_Name said, ""do not tell your father, for you will get punished for your bad grade."" Generic_Name did what Generic_Name told her, and told her father. To her surprise he was not mad at all and found her a tutor.

Furthermore, asking a person with experience will help you out a lot. They will help you stay away from what terrible things could happen. The quote from a commercial, ""we know a thing or two, because we have seen a thing or two,"" is very valid, for someone who has knowledge on the choices you have made, will try to shift you on the right path. For example, my uncle does not have a job, and did not pay his rent for three months. He asked my mother for advice, and she said, ""I was in this predicament last year, and I found a decent paying job to help pay for my rent,"" so he took her advice and looked for a job, and once he found one he was well on his way to pay his rent.

In conclusion, asking multiple people for advice will make life easier. It will help in the long run, and also help make better decisions. Different opinions is not always such a bad thing; receiving advice from many people will increase your knowledge. ",0,0.006867374,0,True

Driverless cars could change the world for the better. They could make our lives easier and less stressful. Driverless cars could save lives, save time, and save money. These cars would be a great replacement for the manual cars used today. Driverless cars could benefit our society greatly.

This new invention of cars without drivers could save many lives. Each year thousands of citizens die, or are injured due to car accidents. These accidents are caused mainly by drivers. If cars continue to need drivers, many more deaths will result from this horrible choice. The drivers of these vehicles could be drunk, driving illegally without a valid license, texting, or distracted, resulting in car crashes. The possibilities as to why a person driving a car could get into an accident are endless! However, with no unsuitable driver at the wheel, roads all over the world will become much safer. If ,instead of a driver, the car is automated and drives by itself, people could rid the world of unsafe drivers. With these driverless cars, thousands of lives all over the world could be spared.

Driverless cars could save people time. According to paragraph two in the article, Google's driverless cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash. Less crashes would result in less traffic jams. Without traffic jams, citizens would be able to get to their destination quicker and easier. Driverless cars could also save time by not having to constantly run into blocked roads. Due to the driverless cars being automated and controlled by an automated system, the system will most likely be able to detect the quickest route to the preferred destination. Therefore, driverless cars could be an advantage to us by saving us time.

With the invention of the driverless car, homo sapiens (humans) would be able to save money. The first product of the driverless car is not bound to be cheap, but as time progresses, the cost of this new car will eventually go down. According to paragraph one in the provided article, the driverless cars would use half the fuel of today's cars and would offer far more flexibility than a bus. Gas is a very expensive fuel. However, if citizens were to only need to pay for half of the money they pay for gas today, then they could save a lot of money that could be used for more important investments. Also, the driverless cars could result in less car crashes, which would result in not having to pay for damage repair. Overall, the driverless cars would not only your save life, but your money too.

The driverless cars could benefit our lives. They would be able to not only improve the way people live today, but they would also have the power to save lives, save time, and save money. This new car design could be the exact replacement, for the manual car used today, our society has been looking for. With these cars, students would also be able to focus on their schoolwork more, rather than on passing their driving exam. They could change life as people know it.

Or the students could help at a soup kitchen or tutor younger children in elementary school. It would be better for the younger children so they can get a better education and succeed. At the soup kitchen, students could serve meals to homeless people and the less fortunate.

31BC49520E9D,"Dear Principal,

Community service is a very good way to build character. It can help students learn to be more kind and caring. Even though some people may think it is a waste of time, it makes the world a better place little by little. Most students will probably not want to do any community service because they are lazy and do not feel like helping out their own community. In the end, it would be better for them to keep their area clean and healthy, so that they will not get sick.

I think that all students should at least do some community service throughout the year. If just a few hours a week is all it takes to make the society a safer place, then it should be required. Of course, many students will not do any community service, but the ones who do are not just helping society, they are also helping themselves. Community service will help teach them discipline and obedience. The schools that already require community service hours, are already trying to make the kids of today, leaders of tomorrow.

Tutoring elementary kids and helping out at the local animal shelter can become entertainment. These activities are work made fun. If you are doing community service and doing something you love, such as dealing with animals or babysitting little kids, in no longer becomes something that you have to do. It becomes something you want to do. You do not even have to be rewarded. Doesn't it feel great when you know you helped someone out?

In conclusion, I think that each student should have to have around ten hours of community service a year or three hours a month. Community service should also be counted as part of a subject that they are not doing so well in. Most mature students would want to fix a bad grade and keep their community clean and an overall happy place to be in. I think that if students really care about their community and their grade, then they would want to be involved in community service.

Students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they take advantage of it, they don't do what their suppose to do, and they don't learn nothing.

First of all, student take the advantage of attending classes from home to do other things that they need to do. For example turning in stuff late that were long due, not all student that attend classes from home take it as an advantage but those who do they just take more advantage just to have fun and not do the work that they are suppose to be doing. Another thing is they will always try to come up with an excuse of why they didn't do the assignment that they were suppose to do. They take advantage of the time they have to go out with friends to party, to hang out with their boyfriend, and to do other things that are non-school related.

Most importantly, they don't do what their suppose to do, when they get an assignment or project that their suppose to do they just act lazy and not do it cause they know nobody for example, like their teacher wont be telling them to do the work. They will spend most of their time doing other stuff instead of the work that they need to be done with. Students will spend more time partying, hanging with their friends instead of actually doing the work that they need to do which will actually help them later on. Most students actually know the stuff they just preferred not to do any of the work cause they don't feel like doing it.

Finally, The students actually don't learn nothing by attending classes from home all they do is just party, hang out with their friends and boyfriend.

Improving social skills can make it easier for people to ask for advice. When asking for advice, people need to self- advocate, express feelings, and more. If none of that is done, then how else will they get what they need? Social skills is also another way of making friends. The more someone has, the easier it will be to get the best advice. There are students in school that don't feel comfortable talking to a teacher or consular, because they dont feel secure with themselves. Social skills can be a great way to get advice from them, because that can teach students how to be secure, and it get what they need if their friends can't help them.

Seeing other viewpoints can be a great way for people to get advice. If a friend says something, and another friend says something else, then it will be good to understand why they are saying what they said. It is recommended to experience both viewpoints and decide which one fits best, if needed. When both perspectives dont fit, there is always someone else with something completely different.

I heard about the decision that your thinking of making community service a requirement for all students. Now some of my friends were complaining but I honestly couldn't agree more with the idea. What could be so bad about simple community service? All you do is spend a couple of hours doing something that can benefit you in the near future. For one thing, my cousin is now in high school and she needs credit to graduate. Community service will help her complete her hours faster. Another thing is that sometimes you learn from the experience. And all together you have something to do so you don't somehow end up in trouble. Let me show you what I mean.

First and most importantly, for high school your going to need credit in order for you to graduate by senior year. That's where community service comes in handy. You can pick a job like maybe volunteering at the Senior Citizens shelter everyday after school for a few ours. My sister RELATIVE_NAME has been doing this since her freshman year in high school and is now a sophomore and already half of her credits are complete.

Now my moms friends daughter on the other hand is in her first year of high school. She started her credits earlier on in middle school because she wanted to become a nurse. She went to the hospital every Saturday for community service and helped take care of the patients. She would come home everyday telling her family about this and that and how she learned how to talk to her patients and make them feel at ease. In the long run you get a learning experience out of it and now she is sure she definitely wants to become a nurse.

Further more, if every student is required to do community service then it could help students stay out of trouble. After school you could be doing something useful with your time instead of doing wrong, like selling drugs or fighting. If you are required to do community service, chances are the kids will spend more time doing just that and less time laying around and looking for trouble because they'll be too busy to think about anything other then that. Other wise they don't pass high school.

I justified myself long enough and I hope I made my point clear. I'll let you get back to your job and I hope you make the right decision.

However, it is discussed whether these projects should be student-designed or teacher-designed. Both types offer their benefits and disadvantages. On the one hand their is the student's choice, on the other their is the teacher's idea of how the end product should look like. Summer projects should be student-designed because this would allow for students to choose their projects, making them better, although they may not know exactly what they will be learning in the coming year.

If students are allowed to choose their projects, they will be better. During summer break, students like to relax and do activities they are interested in. If they have to do a school project, they may not mind as much if it is something they are passionate about. This interest in what they are doing would cause them to make a better project, rather then if they had to just do a project they were assigned to. This could also allow for further learning caused by the project since they would be looking up new information. It could also have students remember what they have learned longer because it is something they take interest in. Students who are allowed to do projects they chose will make a better project that has also enhanced their learning.

One problem that might arise with a student-designed project is that they might not have full knowledge of the course material they will be learning after the summer. While their project might be very good, and they may have learned a lot of new information, they may not have learned or gone over the topics that will be discussed in class. They may have also not completed the project to the particular standards their new teacher has. While it may be a valid concern that students might not complete the project to the exact standards of the teacher, it is still preferable for students to design their own projects. If the teacher or school designs the projects, it may cause disinterest in the students to complete the project altogether. Also, while the student's projects might not be exactly what the teacher hoped for, they would accomplish the stated goal of continuing their learning over the summer. It could also give the teacher an opportunity early on in the year to correct the students where the may have gone wrong, and a rubric could be provided initially so students know how their project will be graded. Even though students might not know all of the course material they will be studying, they would still produce good projects and their projects would accomplish the stated goal of learning over the summer.

A self-designed project would make students more interested and thus more likely to learn over summer break. This would be preferable to a teacher-designed project because the teacher might assign a topic that is not interesting to the student and they might not learn or complete the assignment. If the topic is something the students are passionate about, then they will remember what they learned better then if they were assigned the project.

It is also very important to know that students need time to rest, a free time when they can sleep and release the tiredness.

The elective courses during the school year should be available for all the student that wish to improve their knowledge. For example, learning other kind of things can encourage students to think about more ideas for their future, and develop new skills on many activities. Taking away the opportunity of students to choose any of elective courses, and forcing them to complete all the hard classes that they need is not a good solution. That will make students to force themselves to do hard work, which can end up in a failing situation.

In other words, its very important for students to be prepared for college. Also students should have the sufficient time to prepare, and choose the career that they really want.

For instance you could be painting graffiti when you do not like the smell of paint. Some people do not like parks and half to clean park, or even cleaning other people trash when they loiter. people that loiter should get caught so other people do not have to clean it up.

Even though most people think there should be more volunteers for community service that is not necessarily true. Most adults say they with there were more volunteers but if that were true wouldn't they get up and do it they're self instead of trying to wish there were young kids doing it for them.

Students will be more motivated to do the project if they get to choose the layout of it and design it all by themselves. When teachers give young adults the chance to do their own project, it makes every bodies project more diverse so a lot of people will not have the same ideas or layouts. Student-designed projects give young people more freedom and opens their minds up to the world of new ideas.

Likewise, after having to go to school and doing work on a day-to-day basis, for about ten months, is exhausting. Once students finally get out of school, they feel freedom. Having a whole two and a half to three months of no school, no waking up early, and no assignments, is one of the best feelings ever. The whole point in having a break is to get out and away from school; where all people ever do is work and learn; and getting to relax. Having to complete a teacher-designed project at the end of a break just does not sound exciting or even remotely fun. Some teachers will give an assignment to the class and make it boring and difficult, to the point where students just push it aside until last minute. Every student learns differently. Some will need a more organized and basic project and others may like to create their own and have fun it. Allowing students to design their own projects is reasonable because it can reach a certain learning level that a specific student may need and at their own pace.

Additionally, teachers may disagree with these statements because they want projects that are easier to grade and go over. If a teacher is receiving over one hundred summer projects that were student-designed, he or she may feel overwhelmed and it may take a longer time to grade. All teachers teach differently, just like all students learn differently, so having teacher-designed projects for over the summer can be a simpler task for the teacher. Although teachers want students to learn over break by doing projects, I am sure they want a break too from grading papers and assignments or being flooded with them once school starts back up again.

The end of each school year is the most exciting time for a lot students and teachers because it is finally break time. Having students continue to learn and refresh their memory over the summer should be a student-designed project so they have the chance to thinks of new ideas and be creative, while also completing the given task. Most students learn differently in many diverse ways, so having the option for a student to design their own projects with certain requirements, makes it a lot more motivational for the students and to open their minds to greater extents. ",0,0.0065442384,0,True

The Electoral college consists of the selection of the electors where they vote for the president vice president an the counting of the electoral votes by congress. thew number of electoral college consists of 538 electors. majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. Why do the state of senator wish to take away electoral college votes? because they think there is to much voting bc under the electoral college system voters vote not just for the president but for a slate of electors who in turn elect the president. but who pick the electors? who are the electors? the electors can be anyone that not holding public officean they pick the electors by the state. that how voters sometimes get confused about electors and vote. But the outcome of all this is that electoral college vite is possible an its less likely to dispute over the popular vote. A electoral vote is possible because the total number of vites is 538 is an even number. So to rap it all up it can be argued that the electoral collge method of selecting the president may turn off pontenial voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying for their state. voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. so state senator i think we should keep the electoral college.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ",0,0.0067280573,0,True
5E67059E3067,"In order to explain, Why is it important that you must participate in at least one particular activity. I am going to give u some examples and some reasons about why you must participate in at least one activity.

First, I agree that you must participate in at least one particular activity because its fun for you and you'll be busy in some work. If you do participate in at least one activity you will get a better grade, have some fun, and you will be busy in some work. If you do participate, you will get a chance to present what have you made about. You will get a chance to represent your self infront of your whole school and your friends and they will know about your confidence and your hard work then you are gonna get a better and best grade.

Also,If you do not participate then you just have to sit and look at other people what they are doing and busy in some work for their grade. If you do not participate then you will not get a better grade and you will not get a chance to represent your self in front of everyone and you will not get a better grade. The principal, your teacher, and your friends will not get a chance to know how confident you are and how much you worked hard on your project or your work.

In Conclusion, to support my reasons you must have to participate in at least one activity and describe your self how confident and how hard working person you are. Finally, that was all the reasons and examples why you must participate in at least one activity.            ",0,0.006838992,0,True
9FF4F0CFFA6D,"Advice is something we all need at some point, ether it's for something to buy or for making a difficult decision. So let's see the things advice is most useful for. Because, advice is most useful when you least expect it.

One thing advice is useful for is making a difficult decision. An example would be, making a choice that will impact you and everyone around you, it could impact you for the worst so some advice wouldn't hurt. Another would be, deciding what to spend your free time doing, because you could end up doing some thing that would be unentertaining.

The second thing is buying stuff. Advice is really helpful for making sure you don't purchase something you won't be happy with. An example would be a video game, you don't want to end up buying one you won't enjoy, so getting other opinions is extremely helpful. Another would be a book, although you mainly find books that you will most likely enjoy, there are going to be books that you will need more opinions to find out if you will enjoy it.

So, advice is useful for making difficult decisions so you don't end up making a horrible mistake, and for buying stuff so you won't end up getting something you won't enjoy. So, next time your going to do something, make sure you get someone else's opinion so won't make a mistake. Because, advice is extremely helpful when you least expect it.",0,0.007993366,0,True
ECF553863BE9,"Dear Senator,

I think we should change our voting method from the Electoral College to popular vote. The Electoral College consists of only 538 people. That's pretty much saying 538 people in America get to choose who our next president is. I think it should be set up by popular vote because their are millions of people in the U.S. that are able to vote, and each individual person's vote should count. The Electoral College is wrong because if there are about 100,000 people voting in a state, and 60,000 people vote for the Democratic side, and 40,000 votes for the Republican side, the Electoral College votes will go to the Democratic president and those other 40,000 Republicans would have voted for nothing. The Electoral College is one of the main reasons half of America doesn't vote. If one state wins the Republican electoral votes every single year, the Democrats will just stop voting. Then most of the Republicans will stop voting because they know they will win, and this will happen in every state until about 25% of America is voting, or possibly less. The popular vote gives evrybody a chance to win.

I do think the Electoral College is better in some ways though. First of all, the Electoral College is full of people that know why they're voting. They know about their candidates and what their candidates are going to do for the U.S. Most of the population that votes in the popular vote don't know why they're voting. They vote simply on if somebody is black or white, Democratic or Republican. I bet if most of America's voters did some research on their candidates, the polls would be very different. I think another good thing about the Electoral College is that the bigger the population of a city, the more Electoral votes it has. If you win the Electoral Vote, you are most likely going to win the popular vote. And another plus side is that a candidate can not rely on a single region to win. He has to be in the favor of multiple regions in order to win the Election. These are some reasons against the thought of popular vote.

Phones have been around for almost 5 decades. Phones have been a social outlet for years but once you start talking you lose concentration. Driving takes a lot of focus because when you dont focus you can harm a lot of people. When u merge texting or calling with driving it's more than likely a deadly situation. Driving is dangerous but most people multitask while doing it.. I believe drivers should not be able to use their phone while driving.(The First Mobile Phone Call)

Phones have been around for years and most people can't live without them. Studies show that ""The average American spends more than 3 hours on a smartphone per day"". The average person checks their phone 52 times a day . We spend most of our free time on our phones when in reality there is so much going on in the world but we don't even notice. Phones are a real big help in today's world but it also very dangerous. We are so addicted that even babies have phones. kids don't go outside and play anymore or climb trees and ride bikes or even catch lightning bugs. kids would rather sit in the house and be on their phones or playing games or watching tv. Most people today can't go 30 mins without their phone.(Straight Talk Blog)&(Smartphone Addiction)

Driving is a necessity in this day and age. The average age to start driving is 26 but most people start when they are 16. Driving is very dangerous

""Nearly 1.25 million people die in road crashes each year, on average 3,287 deaths a day. An additional 20-50 million are injured or disabled. More than half of all road traffic deaths occur among young adults ages 15-44"". You have to drive in this day and age to get from one place to another. If you don't drive more than likely you are walking and most people jobs aren't walking distance. Driving is a way of life.(Road Safety Facts) &(Average Age to Start Driving Now 26)

Texting and driving is the number one cause of car crashes. There have been plenty of laws put out saying you can't be on your phone while driving. There are cars that come with bluetooth so u can answer calls from your steering wheel. There are 1.6 million car crashes a year due to texting and driving. One out of 4 accidents are caused by texting and driving. It's like we can't go a couple mins without out our phones. Drivers should not be able to use their phone while driving.(Texting and Driving Accident Statistics - Distracted Driving)

Driving is something we can't stop but we can stop careless people from killing others by being on their phone. We should pass a law to take people to jail for being on their phone while driving. It's too dangerous for them to only get a ticket. It happens so often that""nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving"". We should have more strict laws on driving safety. When people drive and text their not only put their lives in danger their also putting everyone else around then in danger.(Texting and Driving Accident Statistics - Distracted Driving)

'' What is it like to tour the world and help others?'' one of the peasants questioned.

''It is the most adventrous, exciting job you can possibly get, and the Seagoing Cowboys are looking for volunteers!'' I yelled, straining to get their attention.

I thought to myself for a moment, and started to get attention again. I thought about how I was presenting myself, and what I would want to hear about this program if I were one of these townsfolk. I thought of an idea as I started to yell

'' Would you like to hear some of the adventures I had so you may be interested?'' I asked.

They all cried out,'' Yes please!''

'' I was 18 before arriving in Greece,but I was heading to Greece with 335 horses, and loads of hay and oats to feed the horses with.'' I began to tell the townsfolk, but then I remembered why I was here.

''I wouldn't want to tell you the details though, or else you would miss the opportunity of you experiencing it yourselves.'' I exclaimed to the people of the town.

Everyone started asking if I would tell them what had happened on my journey.

I told them,'' The only way is to find out yourselves is you have to sign up and be at the docks in 3 weeks.'' I finished.

I hoped off the wooden box I was standing on, and I asked,'' Do you still want me to tell you two or three stories, and then you sign up?'' I questioned, again.

They all cried out,'' Yes!''

I told them about giving out horses in Greece, and the time I toured other incredible sites like an excavated caslte in Crete.

After I told two or three stories of my marvoulus trip, every single person listening to me shouted at the same time,'' Where are the sign up sheets?'' or '' Where do I sign up at?''

After being out of breath from persuading them to sign up, I thought that it was worth being out of breath. Now Don Reist and I have twenty extra helpers for our future trips to spots all over the world, and new friends to tell stories with.",0,0.018972928,0,True
d1b21f5d,"The electoral college has many inherent flaws that make it less desirable than a simple election by popular vote. It's only rebuttal to said flaws are weak, and provide little to no reason why the college is beneficial. So there is no real reason to have it in the first place. Popular vote stands to not only correct the errors of the electoral college, but also to refine our voting system. It would accomplish this by closer to a real democracy, and forcing the candidates to win over more people.

A democracy has long been revered as one of the best forms of government. It is more liberating than a dictatorship or monarchy in which people are governed by a higher class, which is more often than not decided by someone other than themselves. In a democracy however, people are given the ability to put who they desire in office. They have the ability to be governed by the person of their choice. This, however, is impeded upon by the electoral college. Because what it does is simply insert a middle man into an otherwise democratic society. We are forced to rely on people we elect to vote for us. Which is irrational as it is completely unnecessary. The extra step only sets us up for deception and betrayal. I mean why would you trust a man on the street to cast a vote for you when doing so yourself is much more reliable?

Though why does it even matter if the candidate you want to vote for won't even come to your state? There's obviously no reason to vote democrat if your say will simply be overshadowed by the wave of republicans in your area. With popular vote though, candidates should be more inclined to visit as many states as possible and get their message out there. Because a 51% vote in a state no longer means a 100% victory. With the new influx of political campaigns, perhaps more people are swayed from their usual path of voting. While yes, there are neutral states that need a push either way, you're not going to increase your votes tenfold by pushing past that 50% barrier. You actually have to earn every vote you get.

Three main reasons why we ask for advise is because we all have fights in friendships,get into bad relationships,and struggle in school.

First of all, we all have our fights with friends over periods of time. They can happen because both of you could like the same handsome and popular boy in school. Fights with your friends can even happen with liitle things like a disagreement and start to fight over that. It happens it's part of life. Another example is you not going to their birthday party last year and you both stop talking to each other. Make it up to her this year and try to plan to go to that brand new amusment or water park that just opened a few days ago.

Secondly, girls could get into bad relationships and not know what to do. To all of the girls out there we all get into bad relationships. I can tell you I have had many of them in my life. We all fall for that cute,pretty, and sinister smile on their face. I have seen it so many times it's unreal to belive that once we say yes we fall into their plan to take our hearts and just tear them to shreds. Boys can be like that. They plan to trap us and never let us go to see the bright beam of love again. Until you meet another one who is more caring and loving and you start to feel that sensation you used to feel and you know you found the right one.

Finally, we all struggle in school. It's like you try and it's not enough to power through the year you are there. I have been there so many times that I can't count. I struggled in math so much I wasn't passing in that class. It was so hard for me to where I had melt downs and called me stupid and dumb. I was at the point to where I wanted to just give up and quite everything I had done. My mom and dad on the other hand had my back and they still do to this day. They tell me that i'm not stupid and dumb and to just keep trying and to push on and to always look ahead and never look back.

To sum it up, all of us have our bad and good days and that's okay. We all find away to push forward and get through it together. As I said in the beginning we all ask for advise because we all have fights in friendships,get into bad relationships,and even struggle in school. All I have to say is don't stop trying if you don't make it try again and just don't stop fighting. ",0,0.007342048,0,True
BF021AC4EF38,"Dear State Senator,

I write this letter to you in favor of removing the electoral college and using a popular vote system to elect a president. One reason is that qualifying citizens don't vote for the president, instead they vote for a slate of electors (Paragraph 10 Sentence 1) who then vote for the president. This process makes it seem useless for the citizens since they can't directly vote for the president. This is a democracy, right? The citizens can't control who their electors vote for most of the time, (Paragraph 10 Sentences 9-10) thus making it much more complex than how it needs to be.

Another reason that the electoral college is a problem is that the system may cause alot of conflict between states, resulting in a big mess leaving only the government to fix. These conflicts can include the fact that only one vote is sent out in each state (Paragraph 12 Sentence 4) that represents all the many voters which could range from a few hundred thousand to millions of citizen voters, making the system once again unfair to voters. The candidates don't spend much time in states in which they know they won't win (Paragraph 13 Sentence 2) but spend alot of time in those states that represent themselves, either the republicans or democrats. The electoral votes in my opinion object alot of campaigning but if the electoral system was gone, then these candidates can spread their word to each and every state without much annoying favoring.

There are a few reasons though that the elctoral college can help maintain some problems which could lead to chaos in the future. For example, if the voters in the state of Florida vote the same for each candidate, the stysem can help avoid any further conflict since only one vote is being submitted due to the debating of the state electors as explained in the above paragraph. Another small reason is that no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, (Paragraph 19 Sentence 1) making each states vote count.

In conclusion, I personally find that getting rid of the electoral college would be more beneficial for the citizens and can avoid any major problems in the future. Even though the electoral college system has its advantages, popular voting would be a much more simpler way to elect the president.                                                                                                     ",0,0.00892859,0,True

I believe children should be able to use and also bring there phones to school.

Or maybe after school they get kid napped and they don't got there phone what are they going to do. Like for example i bring my phone to school just in case something happens.

I don't think kids shouldn't be able to bring there phones. What if there parents needs to tell you something like come straight home. Then they would know not to stay after school. If I was the principle i would allow children to bring there phones as long as they don't use it in class. There are lots of reasons kids should be able to have phones the have calculators on them they help you do everything like check your email.

Schools shouldn't care off of the little things. We text instead of wasting paper. Instead of going to the office to use there phones we could use are own. Its just lunch it wouldn't hurt any one its not like were in class. most kids would probably bring there phones any way I bet if they made it to were we cant bring or phones most of the kids would still bring them.

ACE3E472041C,"Does taking classes from home benefit students.

People might said that,taking classes from home is a bad idea, that is not useful that kids don't learn and they do nothing. In case other people will said that it benefit kids , that keep them safe and I will agree by saying that taking classes from home benefits kids.

Well I think that parents, who decided that their kids need to take classes online is for one of many reasons. for example , I will provided you three reasons why

I think kids do home classes and it does benefits them and yes they learn from it .

Parents are famous and they cant send their kids to a regular school,kids might be in danger and they can attend school because of that or it might be because they have any medical condition.

First reason why students take classes from home is probably because their parents are famous people and they know that, if they send their kid to any school, people will be chasing them,asking for pictures all the time or may be telling them bad stuff. Parents know that in that situation kids are going to be frustrated about it, sad, angry and defently they will not be able to concentrated at school. It will be hard for them to be free and enjoy school. For example on of my friends he is very famous in my country and also in here wherever he goes people is always chasing him, hi has a kid that is 6 .years old but he said that the hardest part is when the little boy goes out all of these people get to him and he gets scared. That's why he said that he decided to pay for home classes, and they prefer their kids to take classes at home. Kids will feel free and no body will be making them feel uncomfortable.

Second reason it could be because the life of any kid can be in danger and the parent of the kid and also any school will know it. They know that if any kid, that is been treated lets said by any organization, attends to school people will try to harm him or it can become a bigger problem. Because the school will defently knows that if they received that kid at school they will be putting the life of many other kids at school in risk and they will not take that change. Of course parents are not going to allow that their kids to be harm or kill. That's why the school or parents proffered to have their kid to take his/her classes from home he/she will be safe and other people too, the kid will get a really good benefit from it because he will learn and he will be safe and other people will be too.

Last reason why students get benefits from taking classes at home is probably because they have any medical condition and it's hard for them to attend any school. They will feel shame,afraid,scared and they will be thinking that everyone at school is going to make fun of He/She, that they will bully Him/Her and of course as I have said before parents will never for any reason are going to let their kids to be unhappy to feel bad to feel frustrated and feel that no body love them that's why they let their ids stay at home and take classes from it so that way they learn and no body will harm them make they feel worthless.

in conclusion,parents who made the decision to let their kids stay at home and take classes from home they make one of the biggest and hardest decisions in life. Because they know that kids will be safe nobody will hurt them, be hunting them , no body will hurt them, tell them mean stuff. They will not feel embarrassed to let people see them, Parents know that defently is not going to be the same that it will not be the same as if he was listening directly to his teacher and getting his note but they know that at least his kids are going to be safe and they will learn to they will still get benefits from it.

When you want the best for your kids and you love them more that life itself, you do what you got to do if that means to pay for his classes in other to keep them safe,and we all know that people might talk and told you that doing home classes isn't going to help you. But you know that is not true, you got to keep working working hard because sometimes students come to school, but they do nothing. What they do is get in problems fight, with other classmates or eventhey fight whith their teachers,they used drugs at school but.

63496B24B9BD,"In order to assure that students continue to learn over their summer break, some schools require summer assignments. I believe these assignments should be designed by students, and not by teachers. Student-designed summer assignments are more likely to be completed because the students know what they need to learn most, what will overwhelm them, and what types of assignments they can do on their own from experience.

In the eyes of the students, summer is a time when they do not have as many responsibilities to take care of at once, and they can relax from such difficult work. Giving a summer assignment will add to their stress, and take away from their enjoyment of the break. Each student is aware of what type of work stresses them out, and how much work they can do before they're overwhelmed. It is important to their health and well being for students to be able to take a break from all the pressure they are under during the school year. When students keep in mind that they must take care of themselves and their mental health, they perform better and are more motivated to complete their work.

In the modern world of education, teachers are beginning to incorporate personalized learning into their lesson plans. Personalized learning is any activity that allows a student to learn the material at their own pace. This makes it so students who learn faster can move on as they need to and learn more topics, and the students who need more attention can take the time to truly understand what they are being taught. Summer assignments should be no different from normal personalized learning activities. Only the students understand what level they are at in each subject, therefore if they create an assignment for themselves they will make it challenging, yet manageable. When teachers design assignments they do not keep the needs of every single student in mind, leaving some students behind. Students designing their own summer assignments will make it so no matter what level of education the student is at, they will be growing and learning at their own pace.

When I was going into tenth grade, I had a summer assignment for my AP World History class. The assignment was incredibly complicated and took over a large amount of my break. While it prepared me for the workload of the class, it made me feel stressed and anxious over whether or not it was what my teacher was expecting. If I had been assigned a project that was designed by a student, I would have felt more at ease about the class and confident in my work. The only resource I had available to me to help me with the assignment was a textbook, meaning that anything I did not understand, I could not get much elaboration on. Student life has changed from what it was when today's teachers were in our position. Every student has experience with different teaching styles and projects, but in general we understand each other better than the teachers do.

I believe that if schools require summer assignments, they should be designed by students instead of teachers. Teachers today are unable to empathize with the opinions and feelings of the studentsin a way that helps them grow. Students understand the needs, wants, and experiences of other students, and can therefore create a project that will effectively foster learning over the summer. ",0,0.018288543,0,True

I have heard about your new policy. I'm afraid I have to disagree with you. Most of your students work hard and still get a C average. Please consider what I'm about to say. I feel that these kids do try and get C' s and D' s. I hope my letter informs you of what it's like.

If the students are obviously trying hard, will you at least give them a chance? Besides, it would be nice to have something to look forward to! Right?

Now If someone is a ""slacker"", (a slacker is someone who doesn't even try,) then why should they play the games? I then agree and understand.

Getting grades aren't all that easy. Thing could be bad at home and the student may not be getting the help he or she needs. Sports Helps some peoples emotion's. Could you try and think about what it's like for some people? God made us all different.

Think about it, for an example, if there is someone who is always cheerful, attempting their home and school work, but getting bad grades, would you take away their dream of being a famous football star, or basketball MVP? Have you ever had a dream that you never got to fulfill? I personal know what it feels like Under a different circumstance though.

5FB0797A7BFC,"Do you wanna be successful in every aspect of your life? Well I believe that it would be a great idea to have every students participate in a extracurricular activity. Because one it would keep every student focused on something positive. Second it could help them get into college or get a good job. Not to mention it could give them learning experiences and keep them out of trouble.

One reason I believe that it would be a good idea is because it would keep students focused on something. For example if a kid decides to try out a sport they could fall in love with it so they work hard at it. So not only could they put that work ethic in the sport they could also put it in the classroom. This can also ready students for the work world when you have to be motivated to do stuff.

Another benefit of every kid doing a extra activity is that it could help get them into a college. Like if you do volunteering at an old folks home that could help out a lot. Or if you did something like charity work. playing sports can also help you get into a good college. Not only could that help with getting in college but also help you get a job, etc.

Also if you do activities it can help you stay out of trouble. Especially if your a kid that does get in trouble a lot this can help you eliminate bad influences , distractions, etc. it can also give you good learning experiences. So if you have an activity going on it will help you greatly with staying out of trouble.

949F659EF5D3,"Having students complete a summer project is a wonderful idea as it gets students in the habit of learning, however should these projects be designed by students or teachers? I believe these projects should be administrated and created by students as it provides a more reasonable work load, opportunities for creativity, and helps the students process the information and techniques.

Teachers often don not know how much work is enough work for the student, but who knows more about students than students. If students designed the projects they are more incline to add a reasonable amount of work while still maintaining the recommended or required information. This allows students to participate in the community more and not stress over the huge amounts of work for their projects. This leads to more time for extracurricular activities that in the end help develop these students into better citizens. For example if a student is overwhelmed by the amount of work they have, assigned by the teacher, they then dont have time to volunteer or help out in the community, which in the end effects the future of these students. Teachers could assign a reasonable course load and still achieve the same results, however if students participate in designing the project it then opens up opportunities in creativity.

Due to more time for students to participate in the community it encourages them to add creativity to their projects making it an entertaining and enjoyable experience for them. Teachers often strive for this goal but do not always achieve it due to less communication with the student therefore creating tension and demotivating the student to work. This allows students to express themselves through personal experiences and challenges they faced. A student is more incline to do their project on things they experienced or places they have been. This helps students discover their passion and even in the future their career. For example if a student volunteered at an animal shelter and discovered their love for animals and want to help more, they often base their project on the belief they stand more toward and want to enroll in more veterinary courses in the future. Teachers could encourage students to pursue their goals and appeals through personal help and motivational encouragement. However the student is restricted of these opportunities due to the project and its massive overloaded information that the teacher provided. Student based projects allow creativity to flow which help students remember and use techniques learned in the project.

Through the use of creativity and personal experiences students can learn techniques and information better since it was made by students. This allows for future success and helps students evolve as learners and innovators. The goal of the project is to maintain the habit of learning however, by introducing a more creative experience students learn more and use techniques learned in the project to help them become more successful and better students. Students who create these projects use methods that helped them learn and help other students benefit as well. Teachers help students learn but do not resonate with them fully as students could help each other through personal experiences with this project. For example a student does the project based on his hobby of fishing, he does an in depth process of research and discovers about the pollution of the Chesapeake bay. He then based his project of pollution and global warming which in the end helps him be prepared and in tune for his environmental science class next year. If teachers created these projects the students wouldnt learn as much as projects made by students as they know what is beneficial for them.

The end goal of the project is for students to maintain the habit of learning. This is achieved through student based projects and resulting in more time for students, which leads to more outbursts of creativity, and in the end helps students learn and produce content with techniques they learned in the project. These results are produced due to students creating a project that other students can rely on and what teachers cant necessarily achieve.           ",0,0.0068019466,0,True

Dear, Principal I believe you should go with policy one because you may never know what might happen and I think students at least deserve to have the phones out during lunch and free period. Students should be allowed to use the phones during these times because if not, emergencies may happen and we may not know until after school is over. For some students it is very important to make a phone call at least ones during free period or lunch. One of the other reasons why they should have there phones with them in school is, in these days like now you have a lot of school shootings happening or other dangerous stuff going on, that sometimes you have to call the police. Imagine knowing your mother is going to be delivering a child and she promised to you that she will call. Now Imagine no one home and your in school and your phone is taken away from you and your mom is the only one and she calls you because she had an accident and she needs someone to call help or you to come home. I also don't agree with policy two because things happen and in these kind of cases you need the phones with you no matter what.

f3914f7c,"""All of our development since World War II has been centered around the car, and that will have to change,"" said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation for America. David Goldberg says this in means of trying to decrease car usage, such as in Vauban, Germany. Car usage after World War II continued increasing for a long period of time until 2005 in the United States the number of miles driven started to decrease. In the year 2013, the miles driven in the United States decreased nearly 9% since 2005 and was equal to the amount of miles driven in 1995. Throughout the whole world people have been experiencing problems with air pollution and due to that many have been trying to decrease the usage of cars in different ways to slow this air pollution.

To start off, pollution from cars has been a large factor of the air pollution today. In the United States, 50 percent of the greenhouse emissions in the United States is caused by passenger cars. Then there is Paris who has been experiencing heavy smog. Recently, it has had days of nearrecord pollution. Reason for such high levels of smog or air pollution can be attributed to a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesel makes up 67% of vehicles in France. Then in the rest of Western Europe 53.3% of the vehicles are diesel.

Next, is how some people attempt to slow the car pollution. The first example of a community trying to decrease the usage of cars is Vauban, Germany. In Vaubaun street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally forbidden. For the most part, Vauban is car free. The only way to use cars in Vauban is to carpool because there is only two places to park in the whole city and they are two large parking garages on the edge of development. Then you have to pay 40,000 to keep a spot. 70% of the people in Vaubaun do not own cars. Anoter example is Paris, who is one of the biggest air pollutants next to Beijing. They have been trying to decrease the smog in their area through slowing the amount of cars on the road. What they did is make it so only cars wih evennumbered license plates could drive one day and oddnumbered license plates the next. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined due to this policy, which showed some reluctance in following the plan. This did not matter though because the smog cleared enough to where the polcy only lasted for one day. Another attempt in lowering the usage of cars was Bogota's carfree day. In this program it is quite obvious that it was just a day of no car usage at all. During this event Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work. Even in the rain people of Bogota participated in this event. Then there is one other case of lowering the usage of cars, which is the natural way, having people just grow away from the car. This is currently happening in the United States, one of if not the largest car users. Like I said earlier since 2005 the usage of cars has decreased. Whether this trend stays in motion or not depends on the idealism of the current and future generations.

To conclude, the use of cars is creating problems in air pollution and due to this there have been attempt to slow this usage. Then back to what David Goldberg said the development of the car needs to stop being the center of attention. So instead what we have to do is take our attention away from using the car to ways of finding ways to limit the cars use.",0,0.0073793824,0,True
F8B406E59DDD,"Cars,the thing that all teenagers want when they turn sixteen. Driving gives a sense of freedom, but it comes with a price. Diving automotives pollutes the air with greenhouse gases. Cities like Paris, Vauban, and Bogota have some serious problems with pollution. Thats why we should limit vehicle usage.

Vauban, Germany is doing it wrong, by living in a ""car-free"" envirorment. The citizens that live here forbidden to own a car, driveway, and a home garage. There is a glimpse of light to all of you that love driving or need to drive to work. In this city, if somebody wanted to own an automotive they would have to pay an additional 40,000 dollars and live at the edge of the city limit. Pollution might be serious but you should just limit the commute to work so citizens don't have to drive so much. Think about it, if you force people that have cars to live on the city limit, but they might work in the middle of the city. I don't see the solution in that.

Paris, France, the city of love, is also the leading city in Europe of smog. ""passenger cars cause 12% of greenhouse gases in Europe."" (Rosenthal 5).Paris is not so bad in book compare to Vauban. Paris has assigned certain days for the drivers to drive. On one day, even license plates will drive and the odds with drive the following day. There are precausions that they take if a odd driver drives on an even day.

But believe me, adding one and a half hours to schools will be beneficial to all the students for their future. The school board should add one and a half hours to school each day because the students can learn more, they can use their time wisely, they can improve the understanding skills of the students.

The school board should add one and a half hours to school day because all the students can learn more. A long time period can make all the students to get a good knowledge about their chapter or topic, So, most of the students might started to get good grades on their tests. The students can take their time to do their own work. So, all of them can discuss about their projects. Sometimes the students can finish their homeworks during the class periods. That might save the time for everyone. Firstly, the students can get some more knowledge is a reason why the school boards should add one and a half hours to school each day.

Another reason is, all the students can use their time wisely in the class. The students will be more into their study at that time rather than their phones. So, the time will be more useful to them. The students can finish their all work in the class. So, they can get some extra time to spend with their family and relatives. Sometimes, the students can get some extra time to read books. And that can improve their reading skills. Secondly, using the time properly is another reason why the school board should add one and a half hours to school each day.

Although, some people may argue that, adding one and a half hours to school each day is stressful to all the studens. But, believe me or not, all the teenage students are always on their phones. So, it isn't a bad idea to add one and a half hours to school each day. At least, they can't be in the touch of their electronic devices for one and a half hours! Lastly, for a better understanding skills the school board should add one and a half hour to school each day. The teachers can explain the chapter or the topic by taking their time. So, the students will understand the chapter more better. The students will be more responsible and the teachers will teach the students with a good understanding level. That will be more beneficial for the whole class. Good learning or understanding skills is the last reason why the school board should add one and a half hours to school each day.

Adding one and a half hour to school is beneficial to all the students for their future.

8BA77BFBC457,"Limting car usage is good because of so many ways.. For one, cities all over the world are starting to do more and more about this problem all the time. All of these have been making a huge impact of the massive amounts of smog and pollution created by cars. Owning a car is very expensive anyways.

The massive amounts of pollution in the air is convincing large amounts of people and governments to start creating societies and communities that are car free, or very expensive to own cars in. In some cases of extreme pollution, the government has made it so the next few days, there would be no cars allowed, except taxis and buses. The results from both of these have been very possitive. When France had issued one of the days, the results were 60 % less in on of the most polluted cities in the world.

Cars are responsible for 12% of the greenhouse gasses in Europe. The United States is one of the largest users of cars in the world, so what does that says about us? So many parts of the world use cars for daily parts of their jobs and lives. Some of these include delivery companies, and other jobs with 50% use of automobiles.

With all of the plans of less car usage, prices are going up. Fines on no-driving days, fees to park your car, and lets not forget the one thing you need for your car, gas. Especialy with the cost of gas going up it is cheaper to buy a bike, than to ride a car.

F5419CDEF2D6,"Dear State Senator,

I agrue in favor of keeping the Electoral College, for this reason it wouldhave to be the fact that it is a much easier method electing presidental canditates. At times I know it can be unfair to most of the voters around the nation but this way is more easier than it might already seem. Instead of the people voting for which they think is the new president, it would be more likely the electors who elect the president for the state. These slate of electors are trusted to vote for the party's nominee. For some states it wouldn't be just random it be either democratic, or republicians. When having the electors it wouldbe possible to be the winner of the electoral vote but not the national popular vote.

For the president's chance of winning having an Electoral College will exceed his share of popular vote. An example would be the election backin 2012, Obama had 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared 6to what Romeny had because most of the states awarded the eletoral votes on the winner-take-all basis, can get a chance of having victory in winning the electoral vote. But there would be a possible chance of having a tie against the states.

Another reason for this debate would have to be the reason that the candidates themseveles have to get the regional appeal from the states. For Romeny that gave him an opporunity but had little to offer. He no electoral votes in the states that he knowshe will win. For this unsuccessful result, Romeny only had regional appeal there for he was less likely to successed in the southern region. For other states that felt as if their votes didn't count, so there for assumed that Romeny had little interest, leading to the thought of an unlawful candidate. Swing states on the other hand have a chance of making it. The reason for that being is voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign knowing that they are going to decide the election. On avergae they are are thought of as the most thoughtful voters (the result is that they have recieved more information and attention from the candidates.

Electoral Colleges balance the weight in political balance that larger states lose virtue of the Senate. For Obama he won that vote based on the amount of electoral votes he recieved from Florida was 29. Also 3 from the state of Wyoming. In other reasons, larger states recieve the most attention from the candidates than the small states do.

Based on the information I have provided you in this statement, I will concluded that sometimes this method can be a little complicated to most voters in the U.S. For the reason is that most of the smaller states remain unseen by the candidates of the elections but sometimesend up winning thepopluar vote for the candidate they chose. In the beginning in starting the Electoral College was held by our founding fathers of this great nation. There for this methodshouldremain as it should. Thank you for your consideration.

Cars have been the most reliable resource in transportation allowing people to go where they need to but it seems like its going down. More people buy less cars and travel without polluting a lot. Many countries took the initiative to have car free days and see how life is like.

Vauban, Germany is an example of a car free society gaining more and more residents. Limiting our car usages is more efficient then using them everyday. Try taking the bus or ride a bike and see how much better it is then being cramped in a car. 70 percent of Vauban's residents don't own cars and 57 percent sold theirs to live in Vauban. Hiking and other alternaives for travel are growing while cars are reducing. Sometimes people can't afford cars or rent one for usage.

Many countries are trying to reduce the usage of cars to clear pollution and allow more ways to travel. Beijing, China is the most polluted city in the world from all the cars and factories they have there. Paris even realized they needed to cut back on car usages and banned odd and even license plate cars usages knowing the smog and pollution was rivaling China. In a week the smog cleared enough for cars to be used again. Cars have a huge impact on civilization.

Bogota, Colombia's Car-free day is a big success. It was a great way to take away stress and lower pollution. Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city along with replacing uneven sidewalks with new smooth ones. The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s. Thats how the constructions of 118 miles of bicycle paths are made.

C09A881E26D8,"Summer is a time for students to relax and unwind from the hectic school year. For some students, schoolwork continues to follow them while on vacation. The projects assigned over the summer for students are meant to keep students stimulated with learning while on a break. Some designs of these assignments are less effective in fulfilling this purpose. There is a split between whether teacher designed or student designed projects are more effective in the long run for students' education, but the outcomes of one style positively outweighs the other.

Student designed summer projects can result in a positive entrance to a class, a better grasp of educational topics, and the opportunity to work around a student's summer schedule.

One summer, I had to complete a large packet, read a book, and examine several sections of a textbook. I felt so overwhelmed by the tasks at hand I found myself emotionally drained. The project took me the entire summer to complete and by the time I turned in my work I had an immense amount of hatred for the class and decided to drop the course. Teacher designed projects are made without the student in mind, resulting in negative tension between pupil and course. With the implementation of student designed projects, students can create a format of learning that they find most suitable for their learning styles. Students would be able to decide what is and is not favorable in order to create a positive connection for the content at hand. Using such design, students will more more willing to learn and comply with the course and less likely to pull away from the material.

After returning to school from my vacation, I realized I did not learn anything from my summer project. My purpose of doing the summer assignment was to just get it done, rather than to learn and prepare for the class.

Without grasping any information, I found that my participation the a summer long project was pointless. In my Spanish class, the projects are formulated where the students have to teach the class, which requires me to create a presentation that will be found intriguing by my class. When I create projects that allow me to be creative and enjoy myself and others, I am able to learn properly and perform well in my classes, which is the case for most student. If students were able to design their summer projects, they would be able to excel in the given courses.

Some may say teacher designed projects will introduce the exact information needed for the upcoming course, but teachers should be able to teach what is needed in school. It is understood that summer projects are assigned to keep students learning, but any information teachers feel students should know should be taught in the classroom by the teacher rather than by the students on their own. Most students will comply when given a summer assignment, but many students may not have the ability to complete a summer assignment with the time given. This past summer I was working and attending two classes at the nearby community college. I would expect to be able to partake in these activities as I was no longer in school, but with the addition of two summer projects, it felt as if my summer had never begun. One summer assignment was long and had due dates all throughout my summer, but the other was a self paced note assignment that allowed me to learn the way I wanted and had interactive activities which many of my fellow classmates enjoyed. I completed the project that I found more interesting before the one I found dreadful as I had no motivation for it. When a project is designed to accommodate the needs and lifestyles of the students, the work can still be done efficiently while allowing students to enjoy their summers and learning.

Learning is a vital element for the academic success of students. The implementation of the learning assigned over the summer should be designed to lure students into engaging into the content rather than forcing them into large amounts of information without applying attention to possible activities in which students may partake during their time off. Summer assignments that provide a welcoming and fun introduction are more likely to keep a student interested in a course, proving more effective for their futures. Keeping the students' interests in mind while using a student designed summer project will lead to positive results on both the students' and teachers' ends, ensuring satisfaction from both parties.",0,0.78489816,1,False

Meaning that if you have a car, you automatically think that will make evrything easier which in some cases it will but in life, we always ahve to go through things that are hard to get us to soemthing better.

Getting to the point of why material possessions can sometimes cause people to think that we can't live without certain things is a lesson as to why nobody really ""needs"" anything and that goes for transportation purposes as well.

We all come into this world with nothing, and we leave this world with nothing and if no one can be happy without material possessions then i feel that we havent learned a very valuable lesson that used to be here when nothing stopped us from walking to a friends house to say hello or to simply send a letter in the mail if you wanted to talk to someone.

2099CD327374,"Dear Senator,

I believe that people like Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and Bob Dole were all right in saying the electoral college should be abolished. I have two simple reasons for this. One being that it is not a 100% way to elect a entire nations leader for four years. The other reason being that 60% of people don't even want it.

First off, the process of the elcetoral college isn't always accurate. For example, in 2000, Al Gore ran for office against George W. Bush. During this election, Al Gore won the votes of the people, but lost in electoral votes, giving the presidency to George. Since we all know how his presidency turned out, we wonder how Gore would've handled things. Voters cannot always control who their electors vote for, which means if an elector is chosen to vote for Billy Joe, he might just decide, when it becomes time, to vote for Jimmy Washington. This would leave voters of that candidate upset, so maybe they too will understand this flawed system. Another reason we need to abolish the electoral college is something we like to call the disaster factor. This is nothing compared to what happened in 2000; the system allows for much worse. Consider that a states legislature is technically responsible for picking said states electors. Also consider that said elector could always defy the will of the people. In 1960, the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing democratic electors with new ones who would oppose John F. Kennedy. In the same vein, electors without faith, have occasionally refused to vote for their party's canidate and cast their vote for whomever they please. Ask yourself Senator, if this were to happen again, would you do what is right and try to dispose of this system? I hope so.

In reference to my second point, do you realize that (According to a Gallup poll) 60% of our people don't even want this system. The way I see it, if i asked three people if I should buy a new car or a used car, and two out of the three say I should buy a used one, I'm not going to go buy a new car despite them. This is the same with the electoral college. We shouldn't be forcing this corrupt way of decididng this nations leader for the next four years, down their throat. This nation is based on beliefs that include the peoples right to have a say in how this nation is goverened. It's so simple, a majority of the people are against the electoral college, so it needs to go. If you, like 60% of the United States agree with my points and views on the electoral college, then you need to do what you can with your authority, to put a stop to it.

All in all, I have strong beliefs, like most Americans, that the electoral college is a corrupt way of giving this great nation to somebody who people think don't deserve it. Based on my emphasis of these two reasons that this failing system needs to go, I think you , Senator, need to put all your power into the downfall of it.    ",0,0.069024615,0,True

In my opinion it has to be the normal land formation, Mars has a lot of rocks and i know there is a lot of stuff in Mars that look like things in our planet. I do believe that it looks like a human face but Mars has sand storms and gets hit by craters all the time and that may be the reason why there is a face on mars.

As we can see in the pictures in 1976, the face looks better then the other pictures. In 2001, the face is gone because of the snadstorm that they had and covered the face. They have no proof that aliens had something to deal withit. They had no foot prints , no sign of an alien, and It looks like to me that t was created by it self. NASA's has no right to say that the face was created by aliens if they have no sign or proof that it was. They don't have proof that aliens are real. That only leads to one conclusion which is that the face on Mars is a land formation.

Therefore, Is the face on Mars created by aliens or is a land formation? The pivtures explain nothing but that it is a land formation. Why? Their is no evidence that it was created by aliens nor anything else. The only way that it would've been created by aliens if NASA's had proof that there were some type of tracks of aliens.

FF410031A764,"Does your school have extracurricular activities? Are you in any of them? Most schools in America have extracurricular activities on or off school grounds. The problem is that more than 50 percent of students dont engage in those activities. My principal wants that to change he is making extracurricular activities mandatory and i agree. 3 reasons are extracurricular activities can be fun, they give students a wider career path, and they can keep students open minded. I will explain why extracurricular activities can be fun, how they widen students career paths, and how they keep students open minded.

For my first reason, extracurricular activities can be fun. For example when i first entered sixth grade i had nothing to do. I was not in any sports and i wasnt engaged in extracurricular activities. That all changed when my friend convinced me to join soccer, my life changed for the better. I never knew how fun soccer was and i probably never would have if it wasnt for him. Students think that just because somthing looks boring it is boring, that is not always true and it can be the exact opposite.

For my second reason, extracurricular activities can widen a student career path. It can happen in two ways, the student discovers they have a hidden talent or they can find somthing they really like to do. When i was in seventh grade i had a friend who was really good at photography. You would never see him or his camera seperated from each other. So one day i told him about the yearbook club and he thought it would be great if he joined. He was so good at it he became the vice-president of the club within weeks. Ever since that day he has tried to get a career in photography.

For my third and final reason, extracurricular activities can keep students open minded. For example when i was in fifth grade my school got a number of sports introduced to it and tennis was one of them. I was already into basketball and i was never interested in tennis. I played basketball at home and not at school so when the school said all students must pick one sport i picked basketball. They didnt let me because there was already to many people so i picked tennis. I did not want to try somthing new but i didnt have a choice. When i went to my first practice i loved it, I never thought it would be this fun. Being in a new sport really made me experience somthing else and from that day i ws never afraid to change.

People may disagree but extracurricular activities are amazing. I explained how they can be fun, how they can change students career paths, and they can keep students open minded. Many people dont know how fun it is to be in an extracurricular activity and i encourage people to join one. now you know why i agree with our principal and how his opinion can change people for the better.",0,0.006497815,0,True

Cleaning trash is important.

cleaning trash helps save the environment and keep the ecosystem healthy. If the environment becomes unhealthy plants and animals will die. Basically the less trash there is, the healthier Americans and the animals around the world wi. Also if students do community service it will teach them discipline. I believe if community service was mandatory it would be a big help although some people disagree.

Some students dislike doing community service, to try to persuade them to do it they should get something small in return such as a gift card to a bookstore or something similar. If students have the ability to earn something, most likely, they would like to participate.

There should also be a day to do community service. If students were able to go every day, then students would take advantage of this to get out of classes. The day to clean up local trash should rotate between a Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday. Every week , the school should rotate.

If the school could this at least once a week, even once a month, it would help the environment. Although students may dislike the idea they would still get something out of it. Anything we can do to help the environment will be a huge help. Eventually are school would even be a role model for others. Then the environment will be helped even more. I think you would agree with this idea.

Accomplishing assignments can lead to success in life and becoming financially stable because of finishing assignment on time and by completing them. The sensation of having motivation to complete assignments and being successful in life is amazing.

Having the mind set of being able to accomplish assignments, and being active in anything can lead to having the ability to not procrastinate. It is important to keep track on which assignments has to be completed because having a incomplete assignments passed due can cause trouble. It makes it harder for a person to finish an assignment at the last minute because of the rush. Procrastinating is not the key of finishing any assignments on time and by having the assignments accurate. Being able to complete assignments on time is precisely important because it can help in the future with any assignments that crosses.

Having the mind set of being able to accomplish assignments, and being active in anything can lead to people seeing a person as responsible or trustworthy. People can see a person as responsible because they complete assignments on time or before hand. People do not have to tell a person repeatedly to have an assignment completed by a certain date. Other people can see a person as trustworthy because they stick to what they asked to do. They finish the assignment before hand or on time, which makes people trust them more. Accomplishing assignments can help reach goals, and it can help in the future.

It is important to have a person active and and determined to complete assignments without procrastinating.

It gives them knowledge on why it is very important to keep on track and to finish work on time.

AF345723174D,"Did you know that asking multiple people for advice will help you make a decision faster? Asking multiple people for their opinions will also make you sure that you choice will be the right one. You might be persuaded to change your opinion which could cause you to make the right decision. You can assure yourself that you are making the right decision because most of the people you asked had the same opinion or similar advice.

Asking multiple people for their advice will assure yourself that your choice is the right one. Only asking one person for their opinion might cause you to make the wrong choice, and asking multiple people will give you a higher chance to make the right decision. A couple weeks ago, my civics teacher gave our class a project that was due the next day, but I had a basketball game the same day which would end at 8:30pm. Since I didn't know what to do I asked my friend who told me to go to my basket ball game and try to finish the project at home. After she told me this I asked my civics teacher and a couple of other friends who advised me to skip my basket ball game so that I could finish the project without any stress. Since most of the people I asked advise from told me to skip my basket ball game which then made me feel like it was the right decision I did which caused me to finish my project without any stress. Other than assuring yourself that you are making the right decision, you could also change your opinion.

People's opinions could change your decision. Asking more than one person who has the opposite opinion than you might persuade you to change your own opinion. Yesterday I asked multiple friends of mine for advice on what sport I should do. I could either do soccer which is every day from 4-8pm, or golf which is on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays for 5-6:30pm.

I really wanted to play soccer, but most of my friends told me that I would be stressed since it's right after school and every day. They told me that golf would be less stressful and will give me time to finish schoolwork or have time to spend with friends and family. Because of this, I chose to play golf which caused me to feel less stressed and gave me free time to spend with family and friends. Seeking advice from more than one person will allow you to not feel confused.

You won't be confused on what decision you should make. Asking multiple people for advice will assure you that you are either making the wrong or right decision. A couple days ago I wasn't sure if I should go to the library to study for my science test during lunch, or study in civics class which is right before my science class. After asking multiple people for their advice, they all said that studying during lunch time in the library would be less stressful and not cause me to miss anything important in civics class. Since most of the people I asked told me to study during lunch time in the library, I went to study in the library and as a result I ended up getting an A on my science test. Therefore, asking multiple people for advice will help you feel less confused.

In conclusion, asking multiply people for their opinions will cause you to make a decision faster. Asking more than one person for advice will also cause you to feel assured that you are making the correct decision. Other people's opinions could also cause you to change your own opinion. You also won't be confused as to which decision to make after asking more than one person for advice. Therefore, asking more than one person for advice will cause you to make a quicker decision. ",0,0.006651445,0,True
4ADD5B2B4FF8,"Dear Principal,

As a member of the student body, I would like to talk to you and express my feelings on you changing the policy to participate in sports or other activities to having a grade B average. Many of our student have a C average, and changing the policy would mean that they wouldn't be allowed to participate in sports or other activities. I think this policy would be unfair. Not only would we have smaller participation in sports activities, but also in school activities. Our sport's teams would fall in numbers and our school functions would be lame and boring, because attendance would be down. So why not change the policy to at least a grade C average? I think this would be more fair to all the students. It would push the students below a C average to achieve something more and improve their grade, and the students above a C average to maintain or slightly improve their grade.

Making the requirement a C average to participate in sports and school activities could also help our school to become academically sound. Making it a B average could do the opposite. Students who have C' s and D' s would feel discouraged and just give up there for dropping are school's average grades really low. We don't want this to happen, so instead of making it a B average let's make it a C average! Mr. Principal I sincerely hope you will take into consideration all that I have expressed to you.

Sincerely,

41A45843C231,"Part of our current edgucation system provides free chidcare to parents in adition to helping yonger students develope socially. This is why brick and morder schools will always be a necesity for elementery schoolers, but students outside that age range should have the opportunity to demonstrate their responcibility inorder to receive the privilage of being taught at home rather then at school because of social distractions, and the general time sink that is school .

All you ever hear about public schools today is bullying, exclusion, and drama that is pointless and distracts students from their academics, the solution is right infront of us, online school. Online school would be superior to traditional brick and morter school because students would have minimul opportunities to interact with one and other durring class which would make classroom control easier for the teacher. In adition to students having minimul opportunities to speak in class, everything that was said durring the class could be monitered by the teacher or by an automated program designed to detect any buzz words, unkind or curse words. The audomation could also keep count of the number of times students cursed or said rude things to eachother and report these infractions to the teacher. While this process might sound invasive, it isn't anything that teachers don't try to facilitate with physically, now they can do it technologically.

While the inclass conversations can definently be monitered, there is also out of class social media and txting that could be distracting during online class time, and with no physical adult in the room telling students to put away the phone how could we be sure that we aren't just trading one evil for another? While there are numerous distractions at home that could cause students grades to dip, the solution to this potential problem is that online school would need to be a privilage and not a right. Class time would need to be monitered.

Another benafit of monitered online school is that with less distractions the class could move faster which would allow extra time for students to persue recreational activities, and academic interests- this system would allow students to seperate their work time from their play time in a way that is just not possible today. This system of having extra time to dedicate to passions would also be benafitial in incentivising students to pay attention during class. This system also promotes better friendships by giving students time to persue interests outside of school-- providing an outlet to meet like minded people.

While online school isn't a perfect solution, it could change the way that manny students view school as a whole. Instead of being forced to sit in a building all day with other kids, we could be at home leaning on our own time with pre-recorded videos. With online schooling students get the opportunity to control their own edcation, and they are also incentivised to preform well, not because they are compeeting for spots at some perstegeous collage, but becuause they want their own free time.     ",0,0.006630891,0,True
146550E45D18,"There are several reasons for which I do not belive in the process of the Electoral Collage, First of all the system in which the goverment presides is internally corrupt. Under the EC voters votes do not count. Even if the entire state votes for one candidate 100% the person representing the state may choose to say that the other candiate won. Therfore messing up the actual count by saying that all the people in that particular state voted for a singular candiate. Now lets be real no state is going to entirely vote for a single candidate,but lets say that Obama's count for Florida was 25% instead of the 75% it supposeably was. Obama would not have won. It is a well known fact that if not for the electoral collage Obama would not have won at all. Same with John Kerry. Who are the elcators who voted for him? Who are the electors at all? Well that's something for the state to decide. The state picks up to three people to be the speakers for those states. They try to find,(are

SUPPOSED

) to find a non decided not on any side representative for that state. But that plan has failed.

The disaster factor is the best known argument against the EC. According to S2:""The Indefensable Electoral Collage"" By Bradford Plumer. Richard Nixon,Jimmy Carter,Bob Dole and ETC all agree on abolishing the EC. After Al Gore won the presidental election in 2000 due to the popular vote of the people, The thing best known as the diaster factor came into play. The disaster factor is a fiasco that happens in the American goverment. This happened because according to the law state legislaters are techically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. In 1960 this happened to then Vice President(also running for the big chair) Nixon. The state corresponders for Hawaii overthrew Nixons oppents electors votes in order for him to win. He cheated to win. He bribed the electors because lets be real who is gonna turn down 50,000 dollars? Its the electors fault that bad leadership comes to America.

""The EC is widely regarded as an Ananchronism""according to the article posted by Richard A Posner. Once again yet another reason to Abolish the EC.Being a Democrat myself the way the Electoral Collage is set up is absolutely preposterous.

The third and final reason for the abolishment of the EC is simple. The votes NEVER count, like ever. And im sick and tired  of stupid presidents winning (like Obama the hijo de puta).No single president is going to be everbodys president even the greats such as Geogre Washington, John F Kennedy and Abaraham Lincoln were not everybodys presidents not everyone agreed on their radical ideas but NOBODY AGREES WITH OBAMA NOBODY!!!!!!!! But because of false votes made by the elctives Obama won anyway. But there is serveral things i would like to conclude with look below.

Anyway the EC should be abolished because it is a poopoo rule. And....................................................................

I am going to show my opinion about Texting or being on the phone while driving and, I show some you'll what could happened when you decide to be on the phone while driving. An I hope when you are reading this, I hope you chance your mind about texting while driving and I should thank all my reader for taking the time up to reading this essay.

When you are driving a car you hear a text pop up on your phone and you want to get it so bad and you do but, when you do you stop paying attention to the road for just a minute then a car behind you hunks because you aren't driving right and that make you jump so you start driving right. The driver was just lucky that he just got hunk at or it could've binned much worst like a car accident, and someone could have got hurt. In my opinion people shouldn't not be texting while driving because it only takes a simple mistake, and someone could get hurt. I think that it was a good idea that modern cars develop cars that you can call people and talk to people on the phone while driving plus they have their full attention. When you are texting while driving you looking up and down while driving and I would suggest people should put that do not disturb on your phone or you can put it in the glove department, so you won't be interrupted while driving.

My conclusion to all this is drive safe because I don't want to look on the news and see anybody getting hurt because of you are on your phone. If you don't care do it to save the other people from driving and I see why they are pushing this to be outlaws so there could be less accident on the road.

CAD24215C906,"""School activities can help a student grow, learn, and be taught more about adulthood."" said Generic_Name. My principal has made a policy where a student must take at least one extracurricular activity. The school gives lots of choices like sports, student council, and you can also work on the yearbook. You can find many more of the activities through your school website. I agree that all students should participate in an extracurricular class throughout the year.

These activities the school has for you to participate in could help make you friends. You could make friends by joining the soccer team and connecting with new people. Making friends could help stop bullying or lower the chance of it for you and your friends. Making friends could increase the grades of yours since you have a friend to help you when in need. Extracurricular classes could start some really great friendships during the school year.

One other important thing a school activity could help with is finding a job. Kids don't usually know what they wanna be when they enter high school or even college, so maybe these activities could help young kids get an idea of what they like to do. Helping kids find out what they like to do could really help the kid see what he or she would like to be in the future. This could also help kids get used to what they wanna do, and then when they enter college, they will already know what they want to try. Extracurricular classes or activities will increase the percent of how many kids know what they want to do when they grow up.

Extracurricular activities could help make school and life more fun. Fun is something a child or kid needs in their life, and elementary school through middle school should be fun times. These activities like sports and other things could really help you have fun in school or out of school. Playing a sport you love can help make friends and show you what your interests are, which makes life more fun. I have also had an experience of playing a sport for the school during my middle school days. It was very fun making relationships with others and I decided soccer was what I wanted to do in college.

My principal made a policy that says all students must take an extracurricular activity and I agree with this policy. Outside school activities or in school activities or anything like that could help in so many ways to a persons life. Helping find a job, having fun, and making friends could all help with the future and the present. These activities aren't just something to skip out on, they are something to try. Trying something new could change someones life and could help with decisions through adulthood. ",0,0.006438746,0,True

Students would not have to stay after school as late to make up so many classes and hours they missed by not showing up for one day.

Distance learning could increase students knowledge. Some students have trouble learning new topics in school, It could be because they don't understand it. As a student myself, Learning new topics can be challenging for me. Some students are visual learners and need to see how to do things in the matter of their learning experience. Video conferencing can be a way to understand the topics they learn in school. Other students may just want a little more guidance and that can be solved through online classes or video conferences.

Schools that offer distance learning can impact students perspectives on school. If they're falling behind or failing this could be their ticket to success. This could benefit them to graduating high school and going off to college. Distance learning can be a way that can impact students and others to never give up on school. As a student, They are challenged to seek new information ,share ideas,and experiences to understand our changing world.

c7cee2f0,"Dear State Senator, The Electoral College is a process of selecting electors to vote for the president. The Electoral College has both its pros and cons, many reasons for it to stay or be abolished. However, it has more reason to stay rather than changing to election by popular vote for the President. The wnning candidate for U.S President should be who's the best rather rather than who's more popular. The Electoral College may not be the most democratic method but, it does create a sense of balance. The Electoral College has equal tranregional appeal, and guarantees an outcome. therefore, the Electoral College should not be abolished.

The Electoral College guarantees an outcome. With popular voting and a tie could occur. As, source 3 ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" informs ""The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariable exceeds his share of the popular vote.""18. So the losing candidate could argue that winner isn't who the people want however, it's the political party members who chose the electors. In, Source 1 ""What is the Electoral College?"", it states that ""Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party..."" Therefore, there is no mystery or deceit, each party knows their electors and candidates so the people are the ones who indirectly chose the winner. As a result, the Electoral College promises an undebatabe outcome.

Also,the Electoral College doesn't have any prejudice based on region or location. ""The Electoral College requires to have a transregional appeal."" source 3. Therefore, a candidate has to campiaign in all regions, withought just focusing on just one. So every region has an equal oppurtunity and knowledge to be able to vote. Also this way there's a less chance of ""The residents of other reions to feel disenfranchisedto feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interest, that he really isn't their president.""19. That feeling of equality and ""my opinion matters"" is exactly what America is about and this aspect of the Electoral College captures that beautifully.

In conclusion, the Electoral college may not be the most democratic way of voting however, it is quite fair. If we only had popular voting candidates would possible just focuse on one are to build a strong support base. This would'nt give every region or person a fair chance and strong word, which is against everything America stands for. Equality is one of the major virtues of America and the Electoral College expresses equality through balance more so than popular vote. The Electoral College guarantees a certaint outcome without debates or tie breakers. It allows every region to have a fair chance in the election by making sure they are well informed and included through the recquirment of transregional appeal. For these reasons the Electoral College should not be abolished and changed to popular vote for United States of America.",0,0.008121884,0,True
088C3E8EBAE7,"Dear state senator,

I write to argue in favor of the Electoral College. The Electoral College is as it says on the 3rd source ""widely regarded as an anchronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the candidates who receives the most popular votes the winner."" That was in my opinion pretty self explanatory. This letter is based on information from article sourses I read.

First of all, I would like to start by saying that the Electoral College is helpful to avoid problems where no candidate got a majority. For example in the 5th part of the source 3 it says ""Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both  had only 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively)"" which backs up my claim. I understand the ""wrong"" part of it like in the 2nd source it says ""If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for [John] Karry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry."" meanning voters vote for a slate of electors and they choose the president. Honestly I dont see it as that ""wrong"" but thats my opinion.

Second, I agree with the Electoral College despite the lack of ""democratic pedigree"" for five reasons. First, ""Certainty of Outcome"" meanning winning candidate's share of the Electoral College exceeds his share of the popular vote, example, Obama vs Romney. Second, in the Everyone's President part it says that no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, for example, ""Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win"". Number 3, ""Swing States"" the ""winner takes all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates-as we saw in [2012] election-to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states"". There is also number 4 where the Electoral College ""restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution"" amnd there is number 5, ""Avoid Run-Off Elections"" which is what I used in the second paragraph as a claim.

In summation im in favor with the Electoral College for many reasons. After reading through this side and the opponing side of the argument I can honestly say that I prefer this method as it is. Yes there is a bad side to it but there is a bad side to everything and it shouldn't be big enough for anyone to oppose it.

Study guides also play a role because students may have upcoming test, quizzes, benchmarks, and midterms to pass. Some parents may own a restaurant or a shop and their kids may have to work at the restaurant or shop. students can also have tutoring, babysitting, other sports, and taking care of a loved one. However there are many more things that can keep a student busy after school. With some of these things going on in a students life it can be overwhelming by adding an extracurricular activity to their busy schedules. This is why the principal should not force the students to participate in an extracurricular activity.

Students can be tired form the long 7 hours of school in the daytime. Some students may want to go straight home from school to go eat and take a nap. Also when some students are testing all day they may want to go home and relax. However if the principal forces students to participate in extracurricular activities then they will be even more exhausted by staying after school for the clubs or sports. Some students may not want to stay at school for an extra 1 to 3 hours just for a extracurricular activity. students may have made plans to hang out with friends or go out to the mall. However if they are forced to stay after school then they would have to change their plans. This is another reason why the principal should not force students to participate in extracurricular activities.

Not all students are interested in the activities at the school. The activities at school may not be so enjoyable for the students. Some of the clubs that the students are interested in may not be available at the school. This is why the principal should make clubs that the students would love for example, a fan club for a popular book, a dodge ball club, or a health club. Fun clubs like these are what will make the students enjoy the clubs. But having boring clubs at school like yearbook club can be boring. Also adding fun sports to school like gymnastics or cricket would also bring the students happiness and would make them want to do extracurricular activities instead of the principal focing the students to participate.

As a result, students are busy after school, students are exhausted from long school days, and students are not interested in the activities at school are all reasons why the principal should not force students to participate in extracurricular activities. Students have lots of other things to do after school, students want to go home after a long 7 hours of school and do not want to be at school for another 1 to 3 hours, and lastly students are not interested in the extracurricular activities at school because they are boring.                              ",0,0.006478168,0,True
21E0940DB28C,"Dear principal

I would like to inform you about which policy i think the school should have. I will explain to you why we should have that policy an why not. I will start by telling you about policy 1 first then policy 2.

I think policy 1 is a pretty good policy because it allows us students to carry around our phones an let us use then at sometimes of the day. I also think it is a pretty good policy because if we have our phones an something terrible happens we can call some one so they can help. Even if all those things are great i think some students will try to take advantage of the school policy. I also think some students wont even listen to the school policy.

I think policy 2 is a great policy because their are a lot of students that like to use their phone during class an this policy makes sure they don't. I also think its a great policy because teachers wont have to worry if someone has a phone. Even if its a great policy sometimes us students made need then just in case we need them if we stay for a after school program. Plus some students made need them just in case if they need something.

Those are my reasons why I think these policies are ok and not ok but if I was you I would chose the one you think you wont have problems with.

D37412D51517,"""Alright class, you have a summer assignment that you will need to complete by the start of next school year.""

For many high school students, that quote is often what teachers will say to them at the end of the year.

It is not uncommon for a teacher to give out a summer assignment, especially in math or AP, or Advanced Placement, courses.

These projects can help to prevent loss of knowledge during the summer months, while students are not in school, or even just help the student to warm up their brain.

These projects should be teacher-designed, because student-designed projects will likely not help learning much, it makes grading easier on the teacher, and it helps the students to know what to expect from the class.

Students, just as electricity, will pick the path of least resistance.

That means that students will almost always choose the easiest way to complete an assignment.

That is one of the reasons that students will cheat.

I know a few friends that will cheat on most of their assignments, just because it is often easier than doing the work.

Because of that, the projects that students choose to complete will not be beneficial to their learning.

The student-designed projects would instead be ones that are the easiest to complete, not what benefits learning for the student.

For example, when students are told to make a story using certain elements of their choice, most students will only use those elements that are simplest and nothing more.

Because of that, the students may not get as much experience of writing a story with more complex, yet more beneficial elements.

If students are told to do a summer project, that they have the choice as to what to do, then they will choose what is easiest and not most beneficial to their learning.

If instead a teacher decides the project, then the student will have to use those more beneficial elements.

Also, if the teacher has to make how the students create their projects so complicated, then the teacher might as well just create the project.

Whenever I have to do a project that involves multiple different choices, and the rubric is very vague as a result, I often can not tell if what I have done is an A+ work.

I specifically had to do a project on

The Catcher in the Rye , where I had to choose between multiple choices including an essay or various different visual projects.

The rubric on that wasn't very helpful when I was trying to figure out if I had done an A+ work, because it did not include much specifically about the project that I chose. While that might be fine when I already know the teacher, so I can ask them, it would be much harder during the summer to know if it is excellent work.

Because of this, the students would either just not care that much about the project and just do what they think is the bare minimum, or they would be pressed into doing two miles instead of the only one mile needed for the project.

While this may be beneficial to the learning sometimes, it would also create much stress that would hinder the student's learning as well as life.

Along with this, because of the vague rubric, the teacher may have a different idea of what constitutes a good project than the student.

If the project is designed by the teacher and the rubric is more specific, then that discrepancy does not exist.

And then, because the rubric is more specific, the teacher would be able to grade it on more objective rather than subjective elements, meaning that all the teacher would have to do is follow a checklist to grade it, rather than vague guidelines as to what to look for.

This would make teachers lives easier, especially just after getting back from summer break.

Another benefit with the teacher-designed project is that it allows the students to know what to expect from the class.

For example, when I was in AP World History, I had to outline the first three chapters of the textbook as a summer assignment.

It was very long and specific work, but it helped me to learn about how the class was going to be a lot of outlining, as well that the class would have most of the notes done outside of class.

If a teacher were to assign a project that involved coloring and such, then the student would be able to reasonably guess that the class would have a lot of coloring and drawing.

Or if the assessment were to be that the student should read and annotate

The Crucible , then the student would expect that there would be a lot of reading and annotating in that class.

If the project were student designed, then the student would not have that advantage of knowing what to expect in the course.

A student may realize when doing the summer project that the class would be far too strenuous for them, if so, then they can change their class to an easier class before school starts.

Students do not always pick the easiest projects, so it may not be the most beneficial for their learning to design their own.

The lack of specific guidelines on the project may make it harder on the teacher to grade, as well as harder on the student to know what is the work needed to get the highest grade.

As well, the nature of the project may give the student insight into what the class is going to be like.

Summer projects should be teacher-designed and not student designed, because students will not pick projects helpful to their learning, teachers and students can have an easier time knowing what is going to get the highest grade, and it helps the student to know what the class will be like.

After all, the teacher is the one who is teaching the class.",0,0.0066879326,0,True

Today technology has become a very important factor in todays modern life and has taken many forms, most notably the cell phone, just about everyone has a cellphone. Another form is the automobile, both leading technological advancements that we use everyday also happens to come together often, but should this happen? Should drivers be able to use their cell phones when driving?

Texting And Driving

Recently, and especially among teens, there has been people texting and driving, this can cause a distraction and possibly a fatal or non fatal accident can happen,

Teen driving accidents. . According to EDGAR SNYDER AND ASSOCIATES ¨5,864 teen drivers ages 15-20 were involved in fatal car accident; 56% of teens admit to talking on cell phones while driving; 13% of teens admit to texting while driving. and 34% of teens age 16 and 17 admit that they send and respond to text messages while driving.¨ This information is very hard to ignore and it only proves that cell phone use while driving is extremely dangerous.

While some may say this is only amongst teens this is simply not true. There are also statistics of accidents with non adolescents.

Adults and Cell Phones During Driving . According to Sawaya Law; ¨The results of a survey published in USA Today show that while 98 percent of adults said that they know that texting or emailing while driving is unsafe, 49 percent admit to doing exactly that. According to the same survey, this is in comparison to 43 percent of teens who say that they text while driving.¨

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, the argument over if cell phones should be allowed when driving is an obvious one, they should not be allowed.

53AAB3D1AA59,"Have you ever heard of or saw the ""Face on mars""? In 1976 NASA's Viking 1 spacescraft was circling the planet and taking pictures ,as usual, when it noticed what seemed to be a human face. When the photos were released many people were impressed while others believed that the ""face"" is evidence of life on mars. Scientists believe that this is just a natural landform. If this was evidence of life on Mars it would have been a great benefit to NASA.

When NASA unvieled the photos of the ""face"" on Mars critics believed that this was proof of life on Mars and that NASA would want to hide this information.

Defenders claimed that this theory was invalid because life of Mars would benefit NASA, so why would they try to hide it? To further their claim that the ""face"" didn't prove life on Mars NASA decied to take more HD pictures of the landform.

In 1998, NASA took picture of the face that were easier to see and 10x sharper than the originals. After these pictures were relased people still weren't satisfied and said that alien markings could've been hidden by the wispy clouds. Mission cotrollers said ""It's not easy to target Cydonia""... ""In fact,

It's hard work"". In spite of all the complications on April 8, 2001, there was a cloudess day in Cydonia and the team was able to get very clear, defined pictures. The pictures showed that the Martian was like a butte or mesa, like the landforms around the American West. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" said Garvin.

Despite what the critics tried to argue, there was no way that the ""face on Mars"" proved life there. With more clear photos of the ""face"" and reasons to justify that NASA had no benefit for hiding life on Mars, scientists proved that the ""Face on Mars"" was just a natural landform that had a shadowy likness of a human face.

4F072A94FC53,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for their students. Recently, a lot of schools are considering the route of distance learning. There are a lot of reasons why distance learning is not a smart move. Distance learning would not benefit students because not everyone has access to reliable internet, it would be harder for students to focus, and the students lose the benefits of social interaction and relationships with teachers. Traditional school in a classroom is still the best option.

First, distance learning can be an issue for some because of the lack of reliable internet access. Not everyone can afford internet at all. Also, reliable internet is hard to receive in rural areas and some schools have a majority of students living in a rural area. However, even with reliable internet access, it can still cut out or not work. This results in a student not being able to complete their work which can cause them to get a bad grade. Technology is not always efficient or works the way it is supposed to. The average student does not know how to fix technical errors when they happen. A student should not have to suffer just because they cannot afford internet or simply cannot get it where they live.

On another note, learning at home can cause students to lose focus easily. Students rarely want to do homework at home. They probably will procrastinate or not do their school work. While a student is at home, they have more distractions. They can get distracted by family members, television, video games, cellphones, and other apps on the computer. Also, not everyone has parents that will keep them structured or make sure the student gets their work done. Some parents simply do not care and will not help the student stay on task. Sometimes, the only structure a student has in their life is school. There are too many distractions at home for students to do distance learning.

On the other hand, distance learning can be beneficial in some ways. Distance learning can keep students from spreading viruses or sicknesses to one another and teachers. However, one can still catch a virus or sickness just from their parents or from going out to do mundane tasks. We all get sick from time to time regardless of whether or not we are at school. Most students also have a stronger immune systems since they are young and healthy. This can help them fight off the viruses quicker and easier. Some things, like getting sick, you cannot avoid. At a certain point a measure becomes too extreme and the cons outweigh the pros.

In conclusion, distance learning is not beneficial for students. It has too many technicalities. Distance learning does not benefit students because of unreliable internet, too many distractions at home, and lack of connection with other students and teachers. There is no real solution for any of these problems. It is not fair for the student to have such a hard time when they just want to get an education. School is difficult enough for students without them having to worry about internet access or trying to stay focused at home. Distance learning is not beneficial and should not be offered or used as an alternative to traditional classroom schools.",0,0.009176482,0,True

I think every student should be required to perform community service. The reason why students should be required to perform community service is that it helps out the environment. Some of the students might like helping out the environment. I know it would be fun to help out the environment. It would be fun because students will get out of class.

There are many ways to perform community service. The first way the students can help out the environment is picking up trash, recycle cans, papers, and plastic. The second way to perform community service is that you can tutor kids for 2 hours a week. The third way you can perform community service is that you can do a job. The fourth way is to help make some stuff for the school. Those are my ways to you can do to help out.

Those are my ways to perform community service. I don't think it should be hard community service. If it was hard community service the students couldn't not get the work done. That is why I think students should be required to perform community service.

DAC3B05505BE,"Is one of your biggest fears driving, or getting in a really bad car accident. Either way when it comes to driving yourself or a driveless car there is still a possibility. '' In fact none of these cars developed so far are completely driverless.'' Another thing that came from this passage was ''This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires. so this means you still have fault even if your car was driving itself because you could've took control.

Next, if the car is driving annd has a malfunction then this could cause issues for everyone else driving with them. So one thing that you might ask is well they have sensors that will keep everyone safe. But we all know you need batteries for those things and they wouldn't last forever. So all this does is prove another point, and that is that the driver of this car needs to be alert the whole time while in this vehicle. The one thing that we all know is that people aren't going tto pay that much attention to the road, they are just going to be facinated by the car. So this just shows that this will just cause more danger to themselves and the people around them.

Then, we haven't even talked about how these car respond to emergence vehicles that are driving fast down the street with lights and sirens. Then we don't even know how long it takes for the human to regain control of the car. Do they have to pull the car over, or hit a switch, if so is there a delay such as 10 seconds or so. A known fact is that more police officerss die every year from driving lights and siren down the street on their way to something and die because of someone not paying attention. So if humans can accidently hit each other and sometimes kill each other then why would we want driverless cars doing the same thing.

Now we're going to talk about if the car took gas or electricity or both. The car seems like it would be helpful in certain areas, for example people with fatigue. they coulb be tired feeling like they're about to fall asleep. they have a car driving itself to the location. But who says the car can get them there without loosing gas or electricity. Then they don't know where they are and theycould hitch hike but they won't know where to go. So now they have to take risk and dangers with these cars.

In conclusion I think that these cars arre dangerous but helpful in some areas. The cars are hazardous when it comes to stoping for emergency vehicles because we know to pull off the the right side of the road but a computer might not. Then you have a possibility of the cars having a malfunction and crashing into things killing everyoune.

I am in favor of getting rid of the Electoral College. First of all, even if a candidate wins the most popular votes, they could still lose the election, which is not fair. Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind that we have now. The Electoral college is confusing to many, and voters can even get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate.

Also, there could always be a tie in the electoral vote. If that were to happen then the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where people in the state would decide on the president. The electoral college is unfair to voters. Candidates spend time on ""swing"" states and not on the states that they have no chance of winning.

E10D5E79B0A0,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author explains how certain algorithms built into a system, called the Facial Action Coding System, can detect human emotions. In the article, the author describes how a classroom computer can recognize when a student is getting bored or confused based on their facial expressions. This computer can change the way that the lesson is being taught so that the students are more productive in classes. While the Facial Action Coding System detects facial expressions that indicate a person's emotion, the system built in a classroom computer is valuable to students, because it can manipulate the lesson based on how students are learning.

The ability to have a classroom computer that is able to read the emotional expressions of students, would be very valuable is a classroom, because it allows the lesson to be taught in a way that would benefit the students, according to Dr. Huang. In a normal classroom, teachers create lessons that confuse the students or do not appeal to their learning ability which creates a tension for the learning environment. With the use of this technology, classroom lessons would be more educational and responsive. This is because, the technology is able to recognize when a student is confused or bored by reading their emotional and facial expressions. This is useful since the system can alter a lesson plan to be suitable for the students in the classroom which would potentially help them learn better. For example, if a student is confused during class, it is likely that they will not ask for help, leading them to not understand what is going on in the lesson. Having this technology in the classroom, would sense this and modify the lesson so that a student would be able to learn better and understand the topics.

The use of the Facial Action Coding System in classrooms would be beneficial in classrooms to both the students and the teacher, because it would allow the teacher to adjust lessons in order for more students to understand the concepts. Dr. Huang predicted that the system would be able to manipulate lessons based on the readings of emotional expressions in the classroom.

I think students should be required to perform community service because it will help our community grow and prosper . We may not know it, but when we do thing's that harm our environment, it harms people and animals physically and emotionally, and we need those thing's to survive.

For example, we get things from our environments such as animals to eat, water to drink, air from plants to breath, and wood to build things. So if the people who work in the factories cant breath, how are they going to package the meat, vegetables, fruit, and grains that we need to survive? If the animals cant drink water due to it being polluted, how are we going to get those animals to eat?

What about education? Humans aren't born with the ability to talk, write, or read. We need to learn these things step by step. Education is one of the things that u will need especially to live out in the free world when you become an adult. People nowadays want all of these fancy new cars, and the big house, and the cute girl. Well question is how are you going to get the cute girl, or the big fancy house, and the nice cars without any education? Girls don't want a person who isn't smart. Big houses and fancy cars cost money. Without education who's going to hire you? McDonald's? That's where you are going to end up if your education isn't right.

B794B3C07254,"It is my pleasure to take this great opportunity to express my view or opinion on the above topic; which is positive attitude is the key to success in life?.First and foremost i would like to briefly talk about the term attitude, it can be shorty defined as a good or bad conduct or manner ones shows in public or the kind of act you put up which is either good or bad. If we really take good look at how people live,attitude is the most relevant thing they mostly pay attention to, lets talk about work school.

WORK OR SCHOOL:

If we take good look at this two places, we can see or sort of attitudes aspects, either good or bad that is coming from the students,teachers and many more , showing good attitudes towards others shows how respect you are and what kind of family you came from, most people had a good relationship with others because of their good attitude they have acquire from school or at home,students with good attitude are more easily to associate themselves among others, and become very good friends , teachers really love students who always show a good attitude, sometimes too they can earn some gift from others.

HOME OR CHURCH:

This really take places in our various houses, showing good attitude to your parents or it can anyone ,mostly help to gain favors from people you might not even know they might be your futures helper, because there is a saying nobody knows tomorrow, for instance you went out and some random person ask if you can help him or her to find a place but your attitude did not let him even to ask you anymore ,but imagine some few years later came and you met such same person that ask for your assitance but your attitude was not good at all, maybe he is a manager at your dream job you have prayed to work there, so as soon as you get there you saw he is the one who is going to interview you do you think he will be willing to gave you such opportunity even though you qualified the answer is no he will find any means to let you not get that job , your bad attitude ruin up your whole life, this goes to church too,having positive attitude at church draws human being more closer to God and attract more blessings from him as well.

POSITIVE ATTITUDE AMONG INDIVIDUALS;

Last but not the least is the kind of attitude we gave among ourselves ,this has become a daily rampant that need to failure to get help from other people, imagine you had like 4 close friends but they are be asking for your help on something but some of them attitude is very pathetic , but insisted they really need your help and what you have on you can only help few of them, so would you go ahead and help those who had a negative attitude the answer may be no,because you going to help those of your friends whose had a good attitude first before you assist them too , this really tell us having positive attitude can really gave you so many opportunities or advantages.

THESE ARE SOME MERITS OF POSITIVE ATTITUDE:

1. It creates good interpersonal relationship among individual.

2. It easily to get favor from other people.

3. It always bring peace among others.

4. It really depict the kind of family you came from or the type of trained you have acquired.

THESE ARE SOME VITAL OR MAJOR REASON WHY WE SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE A POSITIVE ATTITUDE;

1. B

ecause it enable individuals to always have a good name in any places they found their selves in and, it also promote economic living,

because you individuals really knows good your attitude is so therefore they will always be proud to share their issues or problems with you without been hesitate.

2. It attract blessings from God , because the bible is even against anyone who does not show a positive attitude among his or her neighbor, and can make your life been successful with the help of blessings you getting from your creator.

HOW POSITIVE

ATTITUDE HELP US IN OUR OWN LIVES;

having positive attitude really help individuals a lot because this earth we live in everything is about attitude even assuming you apply for a job and they monitor you for awhile then later realized you had a bad attitude, do you think the person who is in charge of that work will be willing to hired you the answer is no, because no one can hired someone who has a negative attitude, so imagine now you had positive attitude everything is excellent you even feel proud of yourselves you do not even care wherever you might find yourself in because your attitude is really good and it can gave you so many chances in life that you think you not even to have it, you can also become a remodel to some people , they might even look at you and learn from you , so therefore is very good to have a positive attitude and move free wherever you go , some people really pay attention to people attitudes even more than everything in this word.

CONCLUSION;

Due to time factor i would like to bring my above oppinous to an end and i am pretty sure it may be taking into consideraton and publish it for other people to have access to read and if they had to made some changes in their lives they can surely do so to it.

In Subway, for example, you like to build your own sandwich and put all the toppings you like. You get to choose if you want turkey or ham, olives or tomatoes, or maybe you just want a slice of thin bread and cheese. Just like how you like to build your own sandwiches and food, summer projects should be student-designed. If students were to design their own projects, they would learn more efficiently and have an opportunity to showcase their creativity.

We as a society value creativity and uniqueness. They are qualities that are taught and promoted in our schools and communities. Therefore, summer projects should be student-oriented because they can showcase their creativeness and their own ideas. Students will have the opportunity to show how they think and their originality. As a student, I like when Ms. Generic_Name gives the class a project to do. All Ms. Generic_Name does is give us a topic and tells us to write an essay, do a PowerPoint, or a poster. We get many options, there are no barriers as to what we can do. She says she wants to see our thinking process and wants us to be interested in what we do. If we get to design our projects we will be much more interested in completing it, whereas if it was teacher-designed we would be indifferent towards it. We are not robots or computers that simply do things all the same. We are humans with different ideas and thoughts. That's why you may tackle a problem differently than I would. Thats why summer projects should be student-designed, so we can show our teachers our different ideas and thoughts.

I hate it when a teacher tells us to do our notes in a certain way. If we take notes, its so they can help us study and review. Each person has their own way of learning, so our notes are not always going to be the same. As Ms. Generic_Name says, "" Your notes, your way."" Meaning that taking notes will not benefit her but it will benefit us. So we should take notes our own way. With projects it is the exact same thing. If we get teacher-designed projects, we may not really learn the material and the whole thing will have been for nothing. A teacher is not going to think how a student thinks. The whole purpose of giving students summer assignments is so we can continue learning during our break. But how can we learn efficiently if we are not given the opportunity to do things our way. If we do get to design our projects we will be interested in the topic we are given and do our research with enthusiasm. We tend to do better in things we are interested in and things we are good at.

Many can argue that it is better if the projects assigned should be teacher-designed because it shows students capacity to follow tasks. They also say that it prepares them for future jobs where they may need to do an assignment the way their supervisor tells them to do. But thought our entire school lives we've been doing projects and assignments that are designed by teachers. Therefore, in the summer, students should be able to show their skills and creativity. Being original is an attribute that companies also look for in employees, not just the ability to follow tasks. By allowing students to design their own projects, teachers are better preparing them for the future and their careers.

In conclusion, summer assignments should be student-designed. If we get to design our projects we will be able to show our creativity and our way of thinking to teachers. We will also show more interest in our project and puts lots of effort. And of course we will learn more efficiently if we get to design our projects. It is more beneficial if students were to design their projects instead of the projects being designed by a teacher. Just like how you like to do things a certain way, we students should be able to design the summer assignments. ",0,0.0072414894,0,True

Theres a lot of ways you can stay active and not be board out of your mined, for example; over the summer my Dad took me to work with him, as a carpenter. But not every one can do that, therefore here's some ideas for you: go to a gym, go for walks ,or get a job.

Going to the gym might be a big comment, but its very healthy physically and mentally, you'll start feeling good about your self, maybe even start looking good too. this is my first idea in how to stop being idle.

My second idea is walking. Walking was something that helped me fined my peace, just walking around admiring the world, breathing in the fresh air; now i'm not saying to do it alone maybe with a friend or two, or maybe walk your dog. pretty must enjoy the beautiful world that gods given us.

My third and last idea is to find a job. Working with my Dad has given me a lot of money, I bought nice shoes, cloths and bought my family things too, but it wasn't just about the money. Working with my Dad really has given me another way to look at life, gave me a reason to change my ways and made me see that the real life isn't easy. And its amazing to see the building now, to see how much its improved from last time i was there and now its just like a maze to me.

This is why I believe its never okay to be board, or idle. Because just imagine all the things you can get done, therefore, this is was i think Thomas Jefferson right when he said,"" it is wonderful how much you can get done if we are always doing.""",0,0.00701502,0,True

In our world, these vehicles are causing a very big issue in our lives. Cars are not great for our environment, without them we would be able to be more ecofriendly, be healthier, and keep eachother more safe. Cars are not the only way to get around!

Using cars may help up get around more often, but notice how many accidents people get into. Running into someones bumper, not being carefull, and some times even driving under the influence, are all very dangerous ways you can get injured in a car. Vehicles are a way to get around quickly, but imagine being stuck in traffic for hours and only moved a mile because someone was not paying attention and ran into a street light. We were born with feet to walk. Walking short distances to the store, or market, where ever you wish to go is better than being stuck in a pile of reckless drivers. You can get there in a safer mannor than you would if you were to take a car.

There are plenty of way to get around, other than cars suck as bikes, any kind of skateboards, rollerblades, bicycling, there is a whole list. Not only do these help the environment, but they give you a nice workout. Most do it for their health, some to help them achieve a goal. A simple walk to the store, can help with a plethora of thing that are very important to your body. While doing this healthy habit, you get plenty of fresh air, with can reduce stress, and help your body in ways that will give you a feeling a peace in mind.

Lets talk about the world, we know how to stay healthy. Does our world? It cannot take care of itself. The people who live in it are the ones who provide the maintenance. Without using cars, the gas that they realese will not bother our environment. As said in source 1, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12% of green house gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50% in some carintensive areas in the US."" 50%? Thats half! If these gasses continue to damage our environment, our world will be very unclean.

For generations, cars were known to impress. Even now, people still have cars shows, or gatherings to display their vehicles. The better your car was, the more attention you were receiving. On the other hand, many people have chosen to take the better way out of it and find other ways to get out of using them. Car pooling is another option. Not many people do it, but when its is absolutly needed, that is one option. Keeping everyone happy and healthy, including this planet, is a very important thing that we can do.",0,0.0076054265,0,True
4223E5722166,"To the principle

I think that this is a good idea, but you could be a bit more lenient about the grade average that the students need to have. Instead of a B average it should something like a C or C+ average. Most students have a C average and most are already trying as hard as they can to achieve the grades that they currently get. Also if you lowered the grade average just a little bit the students would still trying to do better, for example if a student is getting D' s and F' s and the minimum grade that they can have is a C then they will be trying harder in school so they can play sports. Also the kids might be overwhelmed by all the school work and practice.

Most students have C averages and are trying as hard as they can, but if they were looking forward to playing a school sport and they had to have a B average then that student will probably not try harder either because they know that it would too much for them to handle or some people just have low self esteem. So if the grade average was a C' s then their self esteem will be raised because not only are they truly putting in as much effort as they can but they get to play the school sport they wanted to play and feel good about them selves.

Another thing is that if the grade average required was only a C and that student was getting D' s and F' s you would still be encouraging student to do better. If the grade average was a B and those students had D' s even if they tried harder the sport would probably end before the next marking period so they would not get to play that sport anyway. Or they simply might not try because they know that they will not be able to catch up in time for try outs.

Lastly the students might try harder but might get overwhelmed with all the school work and having to go to practice everyday so they would either not have time to do that work or forget they had to do it and then fall behind and get kicked off the team.

So i think i gave some pretty good reasons why the grade average should be lowered to a C average. I think that if you did that you would the perfect system. So change the grade average to a C so all the students who want to play sports can and feel good about them selves. Wouldn't you want to be able to do something you like maybe golf or even fishing, but you could because you were making enough profits at work that you knew that you could achieve?

The Mona Lisa is one paint that is famous in the world, according to some new computer software can reconise emotions in people, this system is a innovation of Prof. Thomas Haung, of the Beckman and is working with Prof. Nicu Sebe, they will have help from Dr. Paul Eckman institute of Advanced Science at the University of Illinois man, creator crator of FACS.

BODY

This system has some questions that people thikn, howcan a computer recognize subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel? Dr. Haung said that the procces begins when the computer structs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Dr. Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness - and then assosiated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal"" observes Dr. Haung.

A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Haung predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. Most human communication is nonverval, including emotional communication, notes Dr. Haung. According to the Facila Feedback Theory of Emotion, muving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also help to produce them. whoever thought that making faces could reveal so much about the scien of emotions.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion i tink that this program fantastic because can know how we feal, it identify human emotions just looking our face, it is a nice system because i can know if one person that a love is sad, happy, angry, etc. i thik that this system is goin to be important in the future.",0,0.008237738,0,True
130F9B6DCCF9,"Having good guidelines and being told what the expectations are will give students a better chance at success. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because the rules and expectations act as a rubric for students to follow, as well as making sure the project is acceptable to the teachers requirements.

The rules and guidelines should be clearly stated to assure the expectations of the teacher are met. On social media there are examples of students who have found a loophole in the directions in order to do less work. For example there is this one person who had to write an essay, topic is unknown. There was one rule that was not clearly stated, that being the font and size, the student used that missing rule to their advantage and used a font made up of shapes, something unreadable. As a student I know that students tend to find a way out of work, setting expectations will give students less of a chance to get out of work.

Giving student guidelines are very helpful in getting the project done. In my experience not all the projects I have gotten have all the guidelines. This leaves me stuck. The guidelines help me determine what material I need to research and how much of it. Sometimes it might even be that I dont know what kind of product I am making to convey that said research. This not only provides lack of a acceptable project but also not giving good guidelines gives unwanted stress towards the student. For example some students I know worry that their project is not good enough to meet the expectations of the teacher, or that they are not doing the work that is wanted. Giving guidelines will provide less stress for the student and with that a better outcome with their project.

With a teacher designed project the teacher can assure that the student is learning the material that is needed. Most classes follow a curriculum schedule that the teacher need to follow. Without the teacher giving the project the student might not learn the things required or not learn enough for the curriculum. When I had an online class my online teacher was very good. She provided me with enough guidelines that I was able to learn the material needed for me to pass the class. Having the teacher design the project will make sure that the student learns the material required for the curriculum.

With a teacher-designed project the rules and expectations act as a rubric for students to follow, as well as making sure the project is acceptable to the teachers requirements. If the project was to be designed by the students, there are too many easy ways out. Students can not give themselves the material needed to pass and some students could give themselves projects that are under the expected requirements of the teacher. Having a teacher design the project gives the teacher the ability to assure the student is learning what is expected of them.",0,0.0068597198,0,True

People would agree that is a good idea but other would say its bad idea. Having online class you don't have to wait for other people to finish. You could do what pace you want and to do your classes. It could have a negative part to attending online school. Your WIFI could go slow or not work at all. Having a hard time to achieve the work. Not having a different environment with people with the same age. Not doing the work that they assigned you.

When a student have class online they could find it defalcate to achieve the work that they been assigned to. You would not be able to ask question about the problem. Would have to figure it out by your self. Some online website would not help you to achieve what you are looking for. It could give a bad answer and then you got the whole assignment wrong. In videos you could find ways to achieve it but sometimes there is not a lot of videos on things that you are looking for. If you where in a class room you could ask a teacher to show you how to solve it and you would probably would understand it more. In online school sometimes there is no teacher available at the time when you need them. Sometimes student don't have the time and sometimes they don't turn in there work on time. Would just put it to the side and say"" they would probably do it later"" and never do it. It could be found defalcate to achieve the work on time.

Doing online school its just you and the computer and the class you are taking. Probably have friends but they mite not be taking the same class as you,would not be a able to work together or study. Doing online school would maybe not have time to socialize with new people. You may work or do other things but most of the times they could be older or you just don't talk to people a lot. Having different environment could help you to learn more and plus you would not be by your self. Have other people with you in the same room. Not just you home by yourself with a computer.

Doing online class sometimes could give out a lot of work to do in one day. In the same day you have to turn it in.

Not just going online to find something that kind of looks like the work and you just copy it down. Sometimes student could get lazy and not do there work. Would probably leave it for the last minute to turn it in. The laziness of student could end up with no good grades or passing the class, would take the class all over. You could get distracted really fast with other things that is going on in your life. Not doing the work, it would not take you no where and would not finish the class on time before the due date.

The school would give different ways for student to attend class. It could be online class or going to a classroom in a school. It would be helpful for student to attend more class and probably have more free time. Sometimes student could take advantage on this program to just stay home and do nothing.

Some may have a different lunch time or free time than others. If you did change the phone policy to the first one you are considering than anyone can talk to their friends that have a different lunch time or free time.

b8698450,"The electoral college is how america chooses its president. The electoral college should not be how you think voting works but the complete opposite. It is a process that consist of electors who count the electoral votes. When a citizen votes their vote does not go directly as a vote for the president but it goes for the electoral college in your state. If that state has more votes for one candidate than the other then that state votes for that for that candidate as a whole. If the person I vote for doesn't get the vote for my state then that defeats the purpose of me voting. The electoral college takes away my say in choosing a president, the fairness, and it might have been put in the Constitution by the founding fathers but it is outdated.

The first reason why the electoral college shouldn't be used is because it takes away voters say in the decision for the president. If I vote for someone and the state doesnt pick him, that would mean my vote didn't count. That means i would now mean no one would even care about my vote. My vote wont even help make it a closer race. It's like my vote just vanishes into the air and is never seen again. If there are millions in the country and only 538 votes count. This is unrational to voters.

The second reason why the electoral college shouldn be used is because it isnt fair. It is especially unfair because of the winner take all system in each state. Candidates don't even waste time going to states they know they cant win but only focus on swing states, which for one takes away the privilege for the others that want to vote for the candidate to see them. It also takes away from the smaller states who don't get to put out as many votes as California with 55 or Florida with 29. Alot of states only have three votes and even though it could win or lose a races it still isn't fair to the people.

The electoral college was put into the Constitution by the founding fathers but they are not always right. The Constitution says all men are created equal but we still have had slavery. The Constitution has given us freedom of speech but once we step on school property that rule is taken away. The Constitution is not always the right way to go for everything. The founding fathers were very smart men but they have to think of how the country feels now because they were alive a long time ago.

In, conclusion the electoral college should just be put out of work because it is not the best way to elect a candidate, it takes away my say in the decision,the fairness, it was made by the great founding fathers but is outdated by how the counrty is now. Everyones vote should be out into play with the elections.",0,0.0069477884,0,True

In other words, Students should have the option of attending a public school or online school at home. If students choose to do online school at home, the education should be the same as public schools. Some individuals may disagree because they believe students will not to do their work, or take online school serious. Students should have the option of taking online school at home because their able to get a full night sleep, allowed to start online school whenever they want, and can control how fast or slow the lessons are going.

Students are able to get a full night sleep. Studies have shown that students should get about seven hours of sleep per night. On an average school night most students get five to six hours of sleep. On a normal school night, that is the most students are going to get. The biggest reason why students do not get a lot of sleep is because they stay up doing homework. Most people in high school either have activities or sports they are involved in. These activities can make individuals tired to the point where they end up doing their homework late at night. Students should have the option of doing online school so they are able to sleep in, and feel well rested in the morning.

Teenagers have the ability start school whenever they choose. In this time period teenagers are treated like young adults and our capable of making decisions by themselves. If the student feels tired in the morning, there is no start time for online school. For example, if there is a test they have to take the individual should be well rested and not tired. In Virginia, most high schools start around seven in the morning. These students are still teenagers and their brain has not fully developed yet. Teachers expect students to have gotten plenty of sleep the previous night. In fact, some students only get three hours of sleep which is not good for the body or the brain. With being said students have the opportunity on when they can start their lessons for school.

High scholars have the option of going at their own paste. Everyone is different and moves at a different speed than some people. With various classes students have to pass, not every student will quickly finish them. People tend to take a longer time with math, and may need extra time to understand the concept their learning. With taking school online you will not have a teacher at the front of the class room teaching. If you are a student who understands what is being taught, you dont have to wait on others to understand the concept. Working at your own paste can possibly help the student stay on task, and help them learn the lesson more efficiently. By working at your own paste and slowing things down can potentially help the student in a positive way.

Offering online learning for students at home might be beneficial to students. If students got nine or ten hours of sleep each night, their grades for their classes could be very high. With getting nine or ten hours of sleep students could start school in the middle of the day if they wanted, feeling well rested. Everyone is different in their own ways, and taking some classes in a slower paste doesnt hurt the student.

The main reason is to make a better choice, but there is more to it than that.

After asking multiple people for their opinion you can either combine their opinions to make an even better choice, make the choice that most of the people's opinions agreed with, or ask for more opinions so you can boost your chance of finding the opinion that you think is best.

If you do at least one of these after you ask for opinions, you will always make great choices.

The first reason why asking more people for their opinions is because you can combine their opinions to make a better choice.

If you ask four people for their opinions you might only like two of them.

If you can't decide which one is better, you should combine their opinions.

When you do that you don't have to use every single thing they said when making your choice.

For example you can take sixty percent of one and seventy percent of the other because you like some parts of their opinions but not all.

The next one is that when you are making you choice you should think about what the majority of the people said.

For example let's say that you are asking everybody what the best restaurant in town is because you do not know where you want to go for dinner.

About seventy percent of the people you asked say that Bojangles is the best restaurant in town.

Since they have probably eaten in most places in your town you should trust them and go to Bojangles.

No matter what the question is, the right choice to make will probably be what the majority of the people have to say.

The last reason is that the more opinions that you ask for, the better your chance is to find the best one.

My first reason was to combine opinions but that is only if you only like certain parts of different opinions.

When you ask a lot of people for their opinions you might hear one that is just perfect, so you do not need to combine it with another one.

If you want to find this perfect opinion you should ask the wisest people that you can talk to.

When looking for a wise person you should try to find somebody who is older and more experienced because they will know what is right most of the time.

As you may have realized, asking for multiple opinions is way better than asking for one.

When you are trying to make the best choice you should definitely use one of these.

After asking for opinions you should think about these three reasons and think which one would allow you to make the best choice possible.

When you do that there is no way you can go wrong when you are trying to make the best decision possible.",0,0.0065781013,0,True

But, cars arent that great they are actually causeing alot of damage. the pollution that is given off by cars is ridculous. most people dont relize the damage they are doing let alone the affect cars have on your life.

Frist off, cars are responible for 12 percent of greenhouse house emissions in europe. In some car-intensive areas in the  United states the greenhouse emissions are about 50 percent from cars! thats alot people are causeing without really knowing if we were to get the word out maybe we could change it and make the world cleaner.

Secondly, the united states environmental agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities. they want to make cities and towns more compact and close together. Because in the suburbs cars play such a huge role. these places arent very compact, so people cant just walk everywhere that would take all day. but on the upside walking everywhere is good excerise so while your getting rid of pollution, your also lossing the obesity rate in the united states.

then, in Paris they have banned cars due to smog. Anyone who drove would be fined 22 euros (31 dollars). congestion in the captial france was down almost 60 percent. after a little bit of time enough smog had cleared so they could rescind the ban.

after, in Bogota, Colombia they started a car free  day were everyone took buses, biked, hiked, walked or any means of transportaion except cars to get to work. this reduces smog in that area. all of this walking and so forth also helps people relive stress.  which wil drop the crime rates.

Lastly, in the untied states gas emissions are quite high. but, are believed to go down beacuase in  a recent study , fewer people each year are buying cars or getting liscence. they say if this pattern contuines and they think it will cars will stop coming around.

If a student wants to play sports he or she needs to work for it. When a student wants to join a team he or she must know that the main reason that they are in school is to learn not play sports so, grades should be a priority. Also I think that it can help the student create a sense of responsibility therefore I think that any student that truly wants to be in a sports team will work for what they want. A grade B average can be scary to some kids, in my opinion I think that you should lower it down to a high Cc with no missing assignments because if you do that high C will eventually become an B or even an A. I also believe that a student that has time to play sports has time to do homework. It will take dedication from the students part but it is all worth it.

As to other school activities I think it depends on the activity, how much of the students time it will take. If this activity could potentially lead to the student flailing any of his or her classes, but if it could also help the student raise his or her learning standards.",0,0.0067123366,0,True

Many may answer ""No."" or ""I don't know."" to these questions, only doing such because that's what they've been or what they've heard others say. While many have negative feelings, or no feelings at all, towards the Electoral College, it is a very useful force in electing the President because of its certainty, its transregionality, and it lets ""the most thoughtful voters"" Posner Source 3 decide the election.

Swings states let candidates to campaign where it really matters. Being a voter in a swing state means you have to have extra close attention to the campaigns and the candidates, leaving you to be more thoughtful than voters in states that aren't swing states. And in turn voters in these states will definitely receive ""the most information and attention from the candidates"" Posner Source 2. Voters from these states at the end of the campaigns will no doubt be the most informed voters in the nation, giving them the right to decide the fate of the election for the future.

A successful president must be voted for across the regions of the United States to fulfill the wants and needs of its diverse people. While popular voting can be skewed naturally to one region or another due to their preferences and populations, the Electoral College ensures that one region can't win a campaign alone. If the President was to win due to popular vote and only because of regional appeal, ""residents of other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised..."" Posner Source 3 and that their president will not best represent everyone's interests.

The use of the Electoral College allows for a more certain winner over popular vote, therefore avoiding election crisis. Although there was one ""fiasco"" in 2000, as Bradford Plumer calls it in Source 2, the chance of this happening is very small since ""even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoralvote victory in that state."" Posner Source 3 For example, in 2012, Obama recieved 61.7 percent of electoral vote while he recieved only 51.3 percent of the popular vote.Posner Source 3. A 1.3 percent from a tie is much, much more close than the 11.7 percent that that the Electoral College gives us.

While some may still believe that the Electoral College is outdated and unneccesary, the usefulness of the swing states, its transregional approval system, and its certainty over popular voting proves it to be the best method of selecting our presidents for now and for the future.",0,0.007296669,0,True
42BDAA30E0DE,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Getting students involved in community service is a great idea! By doing this students will have the opportunity to help people in need, help the environment and feel good about doing things for their city. I think all student should be required to do at least 10 hours of community service each year and in this letter I will convince you of that!

By students performing community service it gives them the opportunity to have fun by helping the environment. For example, if all the students from each grade got together and went somewhere in their community and planted trees, that would be a great learning experience for the students and teaching them about how global warming is effecting our planet would be a great way for the teachers to encourage the children to do more with helping the environment.

Next, by children performing more community service it gives them the chance to help others. For example, students could go on a field trip to a local nursing home or a homeless shelter and sing Christmas carols to the residents around Christmas time. I would have loved to have done something like that in school but it was never required that we do community service so it was not done. Also by doing this, the residents would enjoy it and would talk highly about the school.

Finally, by children performing more community service students might feel good about themselves for helping others and the environment. Who could not feel good about helping others and making a difference? By feeling good about themselves students' self esteem level will increase and they will always remember what they did to help someone else and help the environment.

I hope my reasons and examples have convinced you to require all students here at SCHOOL_NAME to perform community service. I think helping save the environment and helping others are so important for young students to do so that whenever they are older they will also wish to do community service. Please take my request into consideration, the world will thank you!

a1939e1f,"Why drive when you can use many other alternatives ! There are many reasons why the citizens in my town and all across the world should limit car use. Three really good reasons are, to limit pollution, to lower stress, healthier life style.

My first reason for thinking that we should limit are car usage because it is a very big cause of pollution. In the article written by Elisabeth Rosenthal she states ""Passenger cars are responsible for up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States"" Pollution is a very serious is that could easily be stop or reduced. Its also can be as simple as walking to your destination, car pooling, or even taking the bus. In the cities of Paris in France to help to reduce the smog and pollution they banned driving even numbered license plates from driving on one day and banned odd numbers on the next, Alternating every other day. Enough smog and pollution cleared one of the following days that the lifted the ban on odd numbered plates they were allowed to drive. These all always very easy ways to help stop pollution.

The second the reason why I thinking that we should limit our car use is if were to use them less it could lower our stress levels. The cities of Bogota, Colombia have day in which no one use a car for the whole day unless its public transportation or a taxis. One citizen claimed during car free day that ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" Another citizen who lives in a community where the streets are completly ""carfree"" says ""When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"". If the citizens of the world were to cut down on the use of air polluting vehicles it could also not only less polluted place but also more calm and less stressed out people.

My final reason for agreeing with idea of limiting car usage is if we drive less we could all lead healthier lifestyles. Imagine how many calories you can burn by walking to corner store or taking a bike to your nearest walmart. The health benefits are endless. If you think about it sitting in the car barley moving to do anything you dont loose any calories at all. So why not walk, run, or jog instead.

In conclusion i think it would be best for all us to cut down the use of driving. My three reason are, to limit pollution, to lower stress, healthier life style. This would benefit not only us but to future generations of the world.",0,0.0067426893,0,True
084898C37A44,"Cell phones, almost every teen owns one. A cell phone is a way of communication with friends, family and business associates. Now, should students be aloud to use cell phones during free times and lunch periods? I think so.

Most schools do not allow cell phones to be used during free times and lunch periods. But, not being able to used cell phones at all would make someone more tempted to use it during class. Giving a student the privilege of being able to use their cell phones during free time and lunch periods could help lower the amount of ""phone users in class."" If a student is caught in class using their phone the teacher could simply take away the privilege for the student to have use of the phone during free time and lunch periods and, they could also remove the phone from the students possession. And, no student wants to have their phone taken away; therefore the student will not have the phone out during class.

The students could simply turn off their phone after these approved times for use. This will also help tech the students that if you do not follow rules, then there will be consequences. This will help the student prepare for later in life. This will teach students to follow rules and help keep themselves out of trouble. There are students who never use their phones during class, and these students should not have to be punished because some students can not keep their cell phones turned off. This idea might just be a very good one.

If the idea of letting students use cell phones during free times and lunch periods does prove to be a fail, then the school could always just go back to no cell phones on at school rule. There is no harm at just giving this idea a chance. The idea might just be very successful. Just because there is a change made to the way things are, that does not mean they must stay that way forever. All they have to do is change the rules back to the way they were.

So, take a chance see if letting students use cell phones during free times and lunch periods is a good idea. Who knows it might be a very good choice.                  ",0,0.0072617875,0,True
78EE5E5D9395,"Dear Principle,

I had just heard you are thinking about changing the grade to play sports to a B. I think this is not the best idea. Many students have problems at home, where projects and homework cannot be done, bringing their grade down a lot. Sports are what a lot of students depend on in school, as an after-school activity, a hobby, or even a profession. Most students are able to maintain an A or B average, but for some its just to much.

I understand that being able to play a sport is a privilege, and to earn a privilege you must do give something back. Having a C isn't bad, its average, and that's the best that some kids can do no matter how hard they try.

I think a C average is fine, and a B might be a little to much.

Another reason I don't think this is a very good idea is because for some kids being able to stay after school is a good way to meet new people and get away from whatever is happening at home that might be bothering them.

Another thing you might consider doing is, if a student doesn't get a high C, B, or higher on a test or exam they have to do something at practice, or not get as much playing time as the players that get good grades.

Thank you for your time, and I hope you choose what is best for the school.

One of the biggest is attending school from home. Online learning from home that provide visuals and conferencing that could help students if needed. This could be a great option in some cases.

Having done online classes myself, I dont think its beneficial whatsoever for learning at home. Having the opportunity of take an online class or classes at home leaves you with a very heavy responsibility. You have to be dedicated and a drive that pushes you to strive for success. Thats something I didn't have when taking online class from home and I failed horribly. I was too busy worried about other things rather than focusing on whats important and what needed to be done.

In some cases some students learn better in school rather than being at home. Online learning, especially at home could be very challenging even when help is provided. Instructions provided from the classes could leave out valuable information. Being a student myself, I find it easier being taught rather than having everything done on a screen, because they can help you solve or get where you need to be. I think attending a school and having an online class is the best solution, therefore you can always ask for help one on one in person.

Every students dream is to be at home laid back doing things you can't at school; you also have access to everything you don't.

BFDD411D610F,"Cars are manufactured. They were designed to be put on this earth and be used by responsible drivers. Having no cars as a safeguarded transportable vehicle is like having your dices tossed on the dirt and you can't predict what you have. It's not define as smart decisions, this is considered by opinions. Individuals have dissimilar opinions on driving, whether it is dangerous to get behind the wheel or that it should be outlawed. Most can agree with the Mobile World Congress in the executive chairman, Bill Ford. His proper approach is to plan a business plan for a world that consider personal vehicle ownership is undesirable so they can put down emissions so it can improve safety. I don't buy it. Rejecting car culture is certainly the dumbest alternative decisions that anyone has to make. To provide reasonings to my strong point, brings me back to paragraph 36. It clearly states in bolded writing: ''With all these changes, people who stopped cars commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit....'' Furthermore, the demographic shifts in the driving population have strong trend that I can agree with. When you are fifteen, you can partake on the written and reading portion of driving and as you study your way to reach your goal, you get your permit. As you ascend your way into the online session and the real world test, you'll find yourself receiving a license as your ticket of permission to be behind the wheel by the law and by the state. Car ownership turnmoil is documented and caputred by the state due to it's nonfundamental implications that's truly not beneficial to those who rely on taking responsiblity for their actions. But if the decrease in measures that can be jotted down on paper proves that you have overestimated your duties and perogative that will not be catergorically denied before a state court or driving school. Once you lose your vehicle, it's not about banning the driving, this is about how to teach the driver on how can he or she be better the next time.

BD82629E71E2,"If some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home. By a way of online or video conferencing the student would benefit.

The first reason is the student can focus because in school there are many distraction. For example you got students taking while the teacher is taking and that takes time away from the students learning. Also the student might not get their work done because he or she was taking to someone which can lead to horrible grades and a awkward relationship with the teacher. But if the student were to do online school there are less distractions and with less distractions the student can get their work done witch can lead to excellent grades.

The second reason is students can be themselves because in school if you don't fit in the student is an outcast. Therefor can lead to depression and suicidal thought also if students dont keep up with the latest trends they are made fun of. Because they dont have $200 dollar shoes or designer cloths but if a student was homed schooled they wont have try to impress someone or a groups of people. The student can just be themselves and they wont be made fun of their cloths because they are homed schooled.

7B38A110CC94,"My grandmother used to say ""Your goals are not going to be done if you don't even move a finger"".

I am totally agree with what Thomas Jefferson wrote about how wonderful is how much we might done if we are always doing something. We can make plans for every goal in life, but it doesn't matter if we just have a plan because we have to work in that plan to get that goal done, we accomplish a lot things more when we are doing something, when we have that determination to get things done to feel proud of ourselves.

First of all we have to feel, we need purpose and strength to accomplish every goal in our life to feel proud in a future. For example, when I was little, my biggest dream was to be with my parents one more time as a family, we were separated at that time; I was in my home country, El Salvador and they here in the United States. I had that dream, but yes, it was just a dream. why? Because I was afraid of the journey to be with them again, they used to tell me ""If you don't do anything you will never know how different your life could be here with us, so throw that fear away and let's do something"". Then in my head I said ""if I don't get that courage to make the journey I will never going to see my parents again"" because I knew that they can't go back to my country, at the end I made that decision and I made it, I am with my parents again and as a gift I learned a new language, now I know i'll be more helpful for this country because I am bilingual now.

Furthermore, we can see in every aspect of life how persons that one day were a common citizen, now are really important in the society because they were always doing something, they were working on their goals. On the other hand we have as example my home country, El Salvador's new president,Nayib Bukele. He was just a citizen like others but he was tired, tired of the political corruption that my country was going through, so here is what he did; he made his plan, he worked on his plan, he worked and made things for the country. Then he became a mayor because people chooses him as their mayor because of all his honest job, he started running for president in 2015, he had a hard time trying to find a political party that supports him with his new ideas and purposes for the country but the parties rejected him because they said he was to young,also they knew he was honest and that he will not admit any corrupt job that affect the country, and they were always looking for reasons to reject him, but he did not give up.

Finally he made his own political party and he get the support of all the people that get tired of live in niggardliness during the governance of other parties, he fought against the two most powerful parties in our country, as a result he won the elections in 2019 and he became the new president of the nation.

Many people think that it doesn't matters if you have goals and make plans for your future if you don't have some resources as money or a good social status, they can also see life as a random game which means that if you accomplish something they will say that is just luck, however; what they call luck, other people call it, late nights of doing something for what you want for your life.

In other words if you want your life to be successful, you don't have to spend your time just dreaming about what you want, because things may be done only if you are always doing something which means; work for what you want, stop thinking about your life goals and start working on them, determine yourself never to be an idler.",0,0.6720526,1,False

Candidates don't really care for small states with small population because they know that they don't matter in the resultof them being elected as president or not.

And it's a winner take all the less popular candidate from the state doesn't get any votes at all.

You dont have to be the most popular in the nation in order to win the precidency and its a winner take all.

For example when bush was running for precident he was not the most popular in the natuion and Gore was, in the end Bush was elected president for winning more the electoral votes then Gore. This is unfair for many people because more then half the nation didn't want Bush but yet he was elected without the popular vote.

Better or worse?

Offering distance learning is very beneficial towards students, it offers more freedom, the environment is less stressful, and students would not have to wake up early to arrive at school. In an online class a student would have more freedom towards their assignments. Students could finish their work in a much faster and productive pace without any in class distractions. Teachers would also benefit from this as they would be able send the worksheets via email without printing all of them off for a in school class. Students would also be able to make a schedule that works for them. This would allow them to put their most important classes in the order that would help their work the most.

In an online class, the environment would be much less stressful. The students would not feel obligated to ""fit in"" with their peers through clothes, hair, and reputation. These examples cause many students stress that may lead to influencing the level of work they do. In an online course, the students would not have that stressful environment holding them back from achieving their fullest potential. This less stressful environment would help teachers with losing their students work. In an online class everything is in a folder or an email so it would be much easier to find an assignment that was not turned in.

Students would not have to wake up as early for online class vs in school. Many students(especially High School) suffer from the annoyance of waking up early. Everyday kids have to wake up at 5:30 AM just to go to school. At 5:30 AM many students are going to be half dead and just plain exaughsted. In online school, students would have the option to wake up later and attend the same class but just virtual. This would help students with their work and overall attitude during the day. For example, Many students play sports and some have practices that end at 10:00 pm, these students have to go home and get ready to sleep, which many teenagers struggle with especially after a practice. Most of these students will not be able to sleep until about 11:30 PM because their brain hasn't settled down yet. This would only give a student 6 hours of sleep before they need to wake up for school. 6 hours is 2 hours less than the average sleep that a teenager needs. Through online school, many teenagers could wake up and get started at 8:30 AM with a much healthier lifestyle. Overall, Online would help students with school far better than a regular public school. Every school should offer this choice if a student would like a better work environment. Online school helps Students reach their fullest potential.

Because that is what it would be like for students if they had mandatory extracurricular activities. Every student having to go to a after school has been a very debated issue for a long time. Mandatory extracurricular activities have their benefits, but their cons out weigh them. The principal of Generic_School middle school has decided that this is false, and that every person going to a after school is a great idea. I disagree with this, and here's why. Students should not have to attend extracurricular programs because of their freedom of choice, not all after schools are equal, and because of the funds needed for them.

First Students should have the ability to choose which after school program they would like to go to. One reason they should be able to do this is they can spend more time with their family which is very important in this stage of their life. Another is that they could choose to do homework instead which I think is something many of them would rather do. Finishing homework gives a senses of relief that it is over and you have nothing to be concerned about. My last reason to support this is letting students make their own decisions makes them more independent as well as learn life lessons you cant get in school. For example they could decided that ""I want to put in one and a half hours into my homework, thirty minutes to study, one hour to have dinner, and four hours of free time.""

Secondly not all of the extracurricular activities the school provides are equal. This is shown in how much time some activities require. Specifically a student may have to go to basketball practice very day while a person in the art club only goes once a week. The next way they are unequal is in how much effort is put into the after school. An example of this is a teen in the book club would need to put in far less effort than someone on the debate team.

The third way extracurricular programs are not equal is in how much is costs to run them. For instance In the art club they use lots of very expensive materials like paints, canvases, and clay. This would cost much more that the soccer team that only needs to replace soccer balls and goals. This leads me to my next reason why Generic_School should not have mandatory after schools

The last reason as to why we should not have mandatory extracurricular programs is the amount of money needed to support all of the activities. Having enough after schools so that all of the kids will be able to go to them will put a lot of strain on the schools finances. This will result in the school not being able to adequately educate their students during the actual school day. If the burden of whos to pay for the extracurricular activities does not fall on the school it will fall on others in one of two ways. The first way is they will charged the parents of the kids directly. Many family's cant pay the cost of the after schools even if they wanted to making the the school still suffer a loss. The second way is to raise taxes which will give parents a lesser financial burden than charging them directly, but will make taxes high for others who don't have kids and will surely not go down well.

In conclusion being able to choose which extracurricular activity you desire, the after school programs being unequal, and the cost to run them are all very good reasons why Generic_School should not have mandatory after schools. If you agree with this than wright a letter to your or our school board telling them your own reasons as to why schools should not have mandatory extracurricular activities.

Many were happy to see other image. But it did not came a clear as they what it to be. But what i think it could be is that a rock may crash into mars and made the face. But over time sand bulid over it gave what it look like in 1976. In the photograph you can see that it maybe face but you can see that it can be a hill.

I disagree because, one all most every kid loves their sports if its watching it or doing it.

And second of all not every kid is as smart as a B or better average grade some can only get a C- or better. I know im only as smart as a C- average. So i say they should only have to keep there grades up at a C- or better to play any sport. Well look at them all most every kid has a C average so why not let them have a C average and be able to play in sports or other activities. If they have a B average then that's great but if they have at least a C average then that's good to, so don't you think we should be able to play sports or other activities if we have C` s? If everyone had B `s then we all would be as smart as each other and most likely get the same points on a test like everyone else, then the teachers would question if we cheated or not even though we didn't we just new the correct anwsers.

AB3263A61ECB,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I do not understand the fact that you want to change the school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average.

In this letter it explains reasons why I think that your new school policy is unfair.

I feel this is completely unfair because most students in the school have an C average which is very close to a B average. This is also unfair because even though the students are not a B average student they are still passing their classes. They should be able to participate in any school functions because they have worked hard for the work that they have shown thus far.

I think you should change the school policy so that any students that are on the exclusion list can not participate in any sports or any school/ after school functions. I think this is a good idea because if a student is terribly bad but get good grades how would you allow this student to participate in any school functions or even leave out of the school building for trips ? I also think this is a valid point because they must have did something bad to be put on the exclusion list. In my opinion I think that these are very good reasons.

I hope that after you read this letter you would understand the importance of why I think your new school policy is very unfair or disliked. I also hope that i have convinced you to change the school policy to a very good school policy, as the one i have included in this letter. If you have any questions, comments , or concerns feel free to send me a letter back.

P.S. I am looking forward to a change in the new school policy.

Well no I can't really imagine a time in the future when no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore . I can't imagine that because theres always gonna be a time where you need to go somewhere & your gonna need transportation to get you there . If there were no cars in the future so many lives would be so miserable because who would wanna walk everywhere they need to go? I know I would get tired of walking . There's so many places where people need to be on time but only with some kind kind of transpotation . Life wouldn't be so great without cars because just even walking the house or even to go down the street for something important would really get annoying & tired .

Well just because there were alot of ""Trafic Jams'' in 2013 doesn't mean just think about the future without any cars . We need transpotation everywhere we go. I know that there's many of ways for transportation but walking , I don't think that's really a great idea knowing that we walk 24/7 365 days out of the whole year . Having a car & knowing that you can drive it around anytime you would like to is actually good , because even though the gas that you put in your car goes up a dollar or 2 every week doesn't just give up or think about not having cars in the future. There are teenagers all over the world that are looking foward to getting them a car when they get older & even teens and adults now that are wishing that they could get them a car.

My position on driveless cars is that what is a driveless car if you still need a driver to drive the car ? You will always need someone to drive the car even if it is a driveless car. There are car crashes everywhere you go , but you can always fix that problem by sharing the road with the other drives . Watching out for other drivers and the people that are walking is a big step of getting behind the wheel . Making sure that there aren't other people in the way so that you will not hit them & even following the rules of the road , like making sure that you stop at STOP signs & even waiting for your turn to turn while driving.

This new policy that you have made is just wrong.

With this new rule applied I can see to many students getting cut from sports.

In your decision you have affected way to many students.

I know people that get a c in at least one or maybe two classes, but making this rule is unacceptable to me because people aren't that smart in every subject.

I would see a lot of rage going through this school and a lot of smack talk about you, and it's all just because you made it so they needed a b average grade in this school.

With this problem you can affect a lot of kids.

You could for instants kick half the players off the football team, then we wouldn't have enough players.

Kicking kids off of school teams could put them in a position where they have nothing to do now.

and results of that could kill a kids self a steam.

A child with nothing to do could cause him to sit on his couch for instants and oh watch T.V.

This could cause them to gain wait and as you say it become fat and then get made fun of.

Making a new policy could even upset the parents.

If this is put into affect in the middle of the year and the kids are kicked off the team or removed, this causes the parents to lose money unless you are willing to give a refund.

Applying this could cause anger and then some students could and will take it out on others for no reason.

I am even affected by this new rule or policy i am not strong in science and i never really have been.

Back to the self a steam part.

Lowering a kids confidence or self a steam is one thing that you should do.

this could make them feel stupid for the fact that they can't even play sports because of this going into affect.

18CB06C8F869,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author makes some very good points to why this type of technology would be useful for people. When teaching a class, it isn't easy to give a lesson and focus on student's faces at the same time, because eventually you'll lose your spot in the lesson while searching through the sea of faces. Another challenge that teachers face, is keeping everyone focused. This technology is very useful to teachers, because it can help them make class less boring.

In paragraph 6, sentence 5, it says, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This feature would be very useful to a teacher so they can change up their style of teaching to best suit the whole class. When in using this computer, teachers can find out who's angry or upset, and can focus their attention on those particular students and figure out what the problem is.

In paragraph 4, sentence 3, it states that, ""By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions."" As I said before, it is very hard to teach a lesson and study people's faces at the same time, so when the computer finds out who's upset, it will benefit the teacher very much. If it's something inside the classroom that's bothering them, the teacher can talk to the student about it, whether they're confused or just don't like the way they're being taught. Let's say, for example, the student doesn't like the teaching style and the teacher talks to them about it. The teacher then changes what that student doesn't like and in turn there is an increase in the willingness to participate in class.

When it comes to being confused in a high school classroom, most high school students don't want to ask for help because they're embarrassed of what their peers may say. They then don't know what to do for school work and assignments, and in turn, they get a low grade. But with this computer, it can give the teacher information on who's having trouble, and they can either slow down the lesson or help that person individually.

In conclusion, these computers are extremely valuable. Not only to the teachers, but to the students as well, because it can help teachers differentiate who's happy, sad, angry, confused, or bored, and if the students are happy in class, they are more willing to participate. Better participation equals better grades. It's not a teachers job to make everyone happy, it's to teach a class, but if some of the students are unhappy and it is effecting their ability to learn in class, than this computer is the perfect way to help everyone out.",0,0.057751354,0,True
4E9232ABC7B2,"Phones and Driving

Drivers should be allowed to use their cell phones while operating a vehicle. Drivers may need to use their phones in order to know how to get where they're going. There might also be an emergency in which the driver needs to use his/her phone to call for help. While drivers shouldn't be scrolling through social media while driving, they should be able to use their phones as needed.

Drivers use their phones as a gps device to figure out how to get to their desired location. Studies show that only seven percent of the 220 million cars in the United States have a built in gps navigation system. This means that drivers must find another way to get directions. The maps app on their phone not only gives directions, but it reads the directions out loud so that the driver is not staring at their screen while driving. Using a phone as navigation while driving is the safest alternative to having a built in car gps.

Furthermore, drivers need to use their phones to call for help in the case of an emergency. Emergencies are bound to happen, especially while you're operating a vehicle. Today's technology allows drivers to make calls using limited screen time and/or voice activation. This gives drivers access to using their phones while driving without causing them to take their eyes off the road. Having access to make emergency calls while operating a vehicle can help save the lives of many drivers and their passengers.

Some might argue that drivers should not be allowed to use their cell phones while operating a vehicle. However, every driver at one point or another is going to use their phone while driving. Regardless of the reason, it is inevitible. While drivers should not be scrolling through social media and sending texts while behind the wheel, they should have the right to make emergency calls and use gps through their phones. Drivers should be given limited access to their phones while driving.

All in all, drivers should be given the right to use their phones while operating a vehicle. Phones can be used by drivers as a navigation system to help them get places safely. Phones can also be used to make calls in case of emergencies. All things considered, drivers should be allowed to use their phones to a certain extent while driving.

No, I believe that first impressions are not impossible to change because when you typically meet someone for the first time many people just try to "" fit in "" or be someone who they really aren't but within time the perspective of how you are viewed can be changed and the first impression you made of yourself the first time won't matter. Also, when you first meet someone , typically you are nerves and you can be seen as a quiet and closed person when in reality you are really outgoing but it just takes you time to adapt to someone and many people don't act like themselfs.

A example of why I disagree with ""first impressions being hard to change"" is because the first time I met my boyfriends mom I was really shy and nerves and I thought was giving off a bad vibe and making myself look "" bored "" even though I was just trying to be careful and not seem so crazy with what I said or did. After a while of me being around her she started to see me as a different person/much better person than i was and she started to see how outgoing I was and how I was nothing like the first impression I gave her and her view of me changed.

Another example I have of how first impression can be changed is the from the first time i met one of my best friends. I first met her through a mutual friend we both had and when we got introduced to each other i thought she was annoying and that she could never be serious but with the time that went by I started to see how she really was and that was her personality and maybe i judged to fast. So when we started to become closer friends my first impression of her changed because now i love her and the first impression of her didn't affect me after all.

So in conclusion , no , I don't think first impressions are almost hard to change. But it is also not something that can be changed within hours but with time the impression you give off can definitely be changed for the better or for the worse based on your actions as well.",0,0.011200986,0,True

2FC2AD6AF52E,"Recently, there have been and more people walking, riding bikes, and carpooling with friends to get to the places they need to be. Because of the fact that people are doing this, the amout of smog in the air has reduced, people are less strsssed, and the enviroment will be a healthier place and create healthier lives. If this continues to happen and more people become involved, it will make live better for everyone and we will live on a much healthier planet. Plus, the price of gas will go down, and who doesn't want that? These ideas that Paris, France and Bogota, Colombia created to have a car-free day(s) are brilliant and extremely helpful to all.

In Paris, France, a short driving ban occured due to massive air pollution. For two days, certain people were not allowed to drive on the roads to help reduce the about of smog. On Monday, only drivers who owned a vehicle with an odd-numbered license plate were allowed on the roads and on Tuesday, those rules were switched. Anyone who did not obey this rule was fined 22 euros ($31). This was a brilliant plan because the amount of smog in Paris was reduced by 60% after five consecutive days of it being quite strong. In France, diesel fuel makes up about 67% of automobiles, so this is what was blamed. The 67% is a high percent compared to the rest of Western Europe which averages at about 53.3%. Reuters, which is an international news agency that has its main headquarters in london, found that Paris has an unusually large amoun of smog compared to the rest of the European capitals. While Brussels had 114 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) and Londion had 79.7, Paris had the absurd number of 147. In Bogota, Columbia, their annual car-free day was created to decrease the smog and to promote other transportation options. The violators of this day had to pay a $25 fine. A businessman in Bogota responds with his opinion on this day with, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.""

About 57% of families who currently live in Vauban, Germany sold their car to move there. Currently about 70% of families there don't even own a car. According to Heidrum Walter who is a mother of two children as well as a media trainer, she is much happier without a car because when she had one, she always used to be so tense. Being outdoors is so refreshing, so why not do it more often? For the past two decades, there have been efforts to make cities better for walking and other alternative transportation as opposed to cars. Vauban is known as benig the ""most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life""(Elisabeth Rosenthal). There is where the movement called ""smart planning"" was created. About 5,500 people live within one rectangular square mile, and this is in attempt to make the suburbs ""more compact"" and easier to use public and alternative transportation. Because of this, there is also less parking around the city and stores are placed on a main street instead of inside a mall that could be miles and miles away from residential areas. Also, parks and sports centers are used more freuently and those uneven sidewalks were replaced with smooth ones for walking, riding a bike, etc. Now there is no more road rage and yelling at those drivers who can't hear you from two lanes away.

The amount of people between the ages of 16-39 have become less interested in getting their license, or it just isn't a priority for them. The older generations nowadays have been know to kee their licenses and continue heir driving. If the decrease of driver's licenses continues, there will be multiple benefits for the environment and for carbon emissions. Automobile transportation is the second greatest source of America's carbon emmisions. The only factor that is ahead of this is power plants. Most people who live in the suburbs have a car, becuase they believe that this is the only way to get around. There are, in fact, lots of other options, and this is only harming our environment because the cars that most people own are held accountable for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. In the United States, however. it is about four times worse. In the areas of the United States where there are a high number of cars, they are responsible for 50% of greenhouse gas emissions. If these percentages can be reduced by using other versions of transprtation besides cars, our world will be a much healthier place and it will live to be a lot longer.

The United States should definetly start having an annual car-free day not only to reduce pllution, but to promote exersice and the outdoors. How fantastic would it be to see more and more people riding their bikes to a park or to a friend's house? If you need to get somewhere, you might as well enjoy your ride by getting some fresh air and some exersice. A reduced amount of time would be spend on the roads because there is less traffic, and that causes less accidents and people will feel much safer. Alternative transportation would also create happier and stress-free lives; who doesn't want that? There are plenty more positive effects on the topic of less cars then there are negative ones, so why not begin this ""smart planning""?    ",0,0.0074642277,0,True
45FB831B9EFA,"Phone & Driving

People are constantly using their phones for different things. There are many great uses for phones. We use them for work, to contact some, even to watch videos and school research. Phones are one thing we tend to keep in our hands. However this hasn't proven to be to the best choice. NHTSA say that at least 1000 people are injured because of phone usage while driving a vehicle. In this paper I will be talking about why I think we shouldn't use cellphones while driving.

It has been proven that cell phone usage leads to deaths. Motor vehicles crash daily and usually there are many fatalities as a result of cell phone usage. Most accidents are caused by teen drivers that just have to pick up their phone while driving. The main casualties are pedestrians. In the year of 2018 alone, around 400,000 people were injured or killed. It is sad that lives are destroyed by one senseless act such as picking up a phone while driving.

Drivers that are seen and caught risk very serious punishment. The average cellphone while driving violation cost about $300 per incident. This violation also comes with a minimum of four points towards your license. This can cost you in other ways as well such as higher insurance premiums. Once you receive fifteen points your license is revoked and you are now left with finding other means of transportation. If you are found guilty of hitting someone you can face one to twenty years in prison. One second of picking up a cellphone may lead to lifetime of misery.

Driving while using a cellphone may lead to a lifelong change with many effects.

Imagine for just one moment a teen has friends or even siblings in the car with them; suddenly the phone rings. The teen looks away from the road to answer or check the text message, hits a pothole, loses control of the vehicle and in now in oncoming traffic. The vehicle crashes killing some of the passenger if not all involved.

You now have several different families that have been united by a tragedy that shouldn't have been. Drivers in the oncoming traffic may be injured as well and now have a lifetime of bills or life changing injuries and scars to hunt them of the day that some teen made a conscious choice to pick up a cellphone and drive. One moment is all it ever takes to change a life.

As you can see from the research people are affected by distracted drivers. You risk serving jail time and giving up your freedom. You can lower the causalities by simple not operating your vehicle while on a cellphone. People would worry less and feel safer if they were assured that you are being responsible and choose not to text or talk while driving.

One way we can make it so at least a resoable amunt of people stay afterschool is tuters for kids and also they can makes new clubs. To make a new club a student has to have at least six students that want to join the club but there also has to be one adult supervising the students. When the club starts it is going to have a place to meet and a scedual or els all the other clubs might want to go to the computer lab but only one can.

When you create a club it has to go into a catigory science, sports, office, or just play. When someone desides to create a new club before evrything a club thats in the office catagory has to deside what catagory it goes into and if its apropriet of they need equipment and all that stuff they also choose where the club will be lead. ss but all in all do not agree with the polacy of all students need to have a after school club it wll be to much work and students have things to do they need a break sand they also ave homework for all of therw classes so I think they shouldnt have to do afterschool activities ",0,0.0070077297,0,True
42853AD34BA5,"Cars may be a good source of travel, but, unknown to some, are dangerous to Earth and it's inhabitants.  Limiting car usage to bicycles, walking, or any other option is a good idea.  The reasons for this being that it makes traffic safer and, more importantly, reduces pollution.

To begin with, limiting use on cars makes traffic less of a hassle.  For example, in the text, ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,"" the author of this source reports that the effects of not using cars is, ""-leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" (Source 3 Selsky)  Notice how, even in a big city, the effects of not using cars are extremely noticeable.  If that car-free day makes it to EVERYWHERE in the planet, no more traffic-related nonsense will occur.  Furthermore, in the passage, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" a citizen by the name of Heidrun Walter states ""'When I had a car I was always tense.  I'm much happier this way.'"" (Source 1 Rosenthal)  Even she finds that the lack of a car makes life easier for her.  This statement, though some would prefer not to admit that they were tense drivers, is true, as being behind the wheel in a large amount of traffic could be stressful.  It is agreeable that the effects of not using cars shows how much better life would be if they were removed permanently.

In addition to reducing traffic, limiting the use of cars could decrease the amount of pollution.  To illustrate, in the excerpt, ""Paris bans driving due to smog,"" Robert Duffer reports that, ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" (Source 2 Duffer)  It is shocking that the amount of driving in that city caused so much pollution that they needed to enforce a law banning driving, a TEMPORARY law.  It is baffling how Paris didn't keep that law intact.  To add insult to injury, according to ""The End of Car Culture,"" Obama plans to curve the amount of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, seein how ""-transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants."" (Source 4 Rosenthal)  Wow, driving causes such a large amount of emissions to the point that it is near the amount of power plant emissions.  It seems rather unbelievable, and some would wish that the article wasn't true, but the use of cars is practically killing humanity.  The point is that car usage is damaging Earth and preventing use would reduce the damage.

To wrap things up, reducing car usage would make traffic less of a risk and decrease pollution.  Perhaps it will make the planet a better place, or fail in the end and continue to hurt the land some would call ""home"".  Just remember this, when you continue to use whatever car you use, remember the dangers it may bring.

It would greatly benefit students who cannot go to school due to an illness, as they wouldn't miss any of the course work that they would otherwise spend time on caching up on, and they would not fall behind the rest of their classmates. For example, if a student is not able to go to school for a specific time period due to an illness, then that student can take the offer of distance learning as an option instead of missing out on classes and course material while they are not able to go to their class.

Distance learning could also help students who don't feel safe at schools a better chance to learn, as if a student isn't comfortable in their working environment, then it would be difficult for them to learn, and rather they stay home and miss out of their school work due to the felling of not being safe in their environment, distance learning would greatly benefit them by way of video conferencing their classes at their pace at their own home, a place that may be seen as safer by these students.

One thing to note is that perhaps other students who can physically go to school may abuse their right of skipping school and instead take online classes when they don't have the need too, however to that claim, it is better for them to still learn the coursework and skip school then for them to skip school and pay the price by missing their classwork.

Distance learning also help students by just being an option available, as they wouldn't have to then stress about missing school if they're sick or unable to go, as they would then have distance learning abilities as a backup.

In conclusion, the inclusion of distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online of video conferencing would benefit students such as those whom, cannot go to school due to an illness, and those don't feel safe at school. Distance learning would also help the general student population by just being an option if the occurrence arises that they might miss school for an indefinite period of time. ",0,0.010230011,0,True

I am a very concerned student. You are thinking of changing the sports grade policy. I and fellow students disagree and think this is a very bad idea. Changing the grade policy on sports would enrage both young men, and women. You would be taking away their encouragement to go to school. So for the sake of the school and your view as a good principal listen to what I am about to say.

By changing this policy a good percentage of the sports players would be kicked off the team. Students who no longer can see their favorite player(s) perform would be disappointed and there goes your school spirit. Also sports players would not do their work to try at what they think is get back at you, some may even go to the extreme of dropping out or transferring. The students who do the unthinkable and drop out would ruin their lives without even knowing it and you would be partially to blame.

The players who stayed in school, well their dreams of becoming a athlete would be crushed without them even getting to pursue it. Most of the players would become out of shape for their feeling of the lack of need to play or exercise anymore. By that act it would cause overweight minors or obesity ,later causing health issues.

These health issues conclude, diabetes, high cholesterol, heart problems, angina pains, and trouble breathing during little physical activities, caused by their over eating caused by being emotional. These issues cause depression, lack of interest, and or mental lapses. So please take this under a very serious condition. This one mistake can ruin lives dreams and agility's.

E0A686C9DEFF,"If your principal decided you had to participate in one after school activity would you agree to it? I would not agree to that because there are many reasons why kids can't do that or they may just not want to. Some reasons for this is they may have little siblings to watch after school, they may have social anxiety, or they may have a job to help support their family.

Many children that go to school have to go home after school to watch their little sibling. As a result of this they may not be able to participate in any after school activities. Many children have to go home and watch their sibling while their parents are not there because they may not have been able to get a babysitter or afford it. Many parents probably rely on their children to come home and watch the kids but if the principal made them participate in an after school activity they wouldn't be able to go home and babysit.

Another reason a child wouldn't want to go is because they might have social anxiety. Social anxiety may keep them from wanting to talk to new people, or be in large, crowded areas. They already have to come to school for seven hours a day, after school they most likely would want to come home and get away from so many people. However it may be good for them to get out of their comfort zone. But it may also make things worse if you make someone talk to people when they are uncomfortable.

On the other hand many kids parents might not have a lot of money and they may need to help their parents with money. These kids might need to get an after school job. Although they might not be able to do so if they are required to participate in an after school activity. After going to school all day most children have something they have to do when they get home. This does not allow them to participate in an after school activity.

5a810c9d,"There are several advantages in limiting car usage. It helps the environment, lowers the chance of crashing, removes stress, and also congestion.

A reason why limiting car usage is beneficial is that it helps the environment. In source 2, France reached several days of ""nearrecord pollution"". This is mainly because of the substantial numbers of cars in France. Since France is dependent more on Diesel rather than gasoline, it emits more pollution causing smog to be more evident. In paragraph 14, it states, ""...The smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world."". China has far more than triple the population of France. Yet, France is able to reach the same level of smog as China. If an abundant amount of people continue to drive cars as the way they do, every country is going to have the smog problem Beijing and France are having. Also possessing so much smog is a safety hazard being that it limits your ability to see from a distance.

In addition, limiting car usage can reduce stress. In source 1, Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, said "" When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."". In source 3, Carlos arturo Plaza quotes "" its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"". It is not only one person who can vouch on the reduction of stress by limiting car usage. A woman in Germany and a man in Colombia can both agree on the idea that limiting car usage reduces stress. When you dont drive a car as much you have less things to worry about. Like, Fearing the possibility of crashing, running out of gas, dealing with traffic, and several more problems. If someone drives less you would have less stress in theory. The idea of stress reduction is an amazing advantage someone recieves if they limit their car usage.

Reducing car usage can also lower congestion. In source 2, ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of france, after 5 days of intensifying smog..."". The implication of limited car usage brought the congestion down 60 percent. That is a major advantage since there is a decrease in the number of cars on the streets. This reduces traffic and allows people to reach their destination sooner than they would if it was more congested. The drop in congestion means that there are less cars on the streets so there would be a lesser chance of crashing. This is a factor that can reduce stress. The reduction of congestion is a positive product of the limitation of car use.

In closing, the limitation of car usage gives the advantage of aiding the environment, reducing the likelihood of crashing, stress, and congestion.",0,0.007508385,0,True
E06960D4A6C1,"To who it may concern,

With all the problems affiliated with the Electoral College, I believe that the United States should do away with the process. This process by which the president is elected is unfair to those of us who are old enough to vote and understand politics. Another disadvantage is that the system of Electoral College is very confusing to many people.

The worst thing about the Electoral College is that it is just outright puzzling. Men who are running for a spot as a presidental candidate are not voted for by the citizens of that state. They have to gain supporters who then become the electors. Then the people of that state have to vote for the electors, not the person to become a presidental candidate. Voters can't even directly vote for who they want. What if you vote for a slate of electors, who are supposed to be in favor of the presidnetal candidate you want, but don't vote for him? What happens then? Presidental candidates who should actually get a chance at running for president because they didn't get enough electoral votes. This all leads to the next disadavntage of the Electoral College, unfairness.

As stated in an article by Bradford Plumer, ""... Al Gore ---thanks to the quirks of the electoral college---won the popular vote but lost the presidency."" The person running for president should be voted for directly by the voters. Someone, such as Al Gore, can get enough of the popular votes, but not enough of the electoral votes becuase they can't swing the votes in some states. This basically means that the majority of the United States would like to have Al Gore as a president, but couldn't because the majority of people in a state didn't want him as president.

To sum it up, the Electoral College should be eliminated from the presidental voting process. People should just directly vote for who they want as president and see where it goes from there.                   ",0,0.006636183,0,True

For example, the author states, at one time Venus is believed to have been the closest resimbled to Earth. In paragraph 4, the text states, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supportes various forms of life, just like Earth."" The planet has a rocky surfaces and also has features such as valleys, mountains and craters. The author states,""The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable.."" This proves that the author presents relatable evidnece that the journey to Venus is a worthwhile trip.

The author gives NASA as an example of the information that is provided in the passage. In paragraph 7, ""NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus..."" The author states that NASA is working on using a device like a modern computer. The paragraph also states how there are problems with NASA's idea as well. The author gives an acurate example to help the reader picture what it would be like. This proves that the author can give evidence that supports the overall claim.

On the contray, the author gives more background information than what good could come from studying Venus.

159FF32192C1,"Ever since cell phones became popular in the late 1990's, in America, they have evolved from being simple mobile dialing and answering machines to basically mini computers that allow humans to now do a multitude of things like surf the internet and bank online to name a few. Unfortunately, in rent years humans have used cell phones to answer and receive calls, text and surf the Internet.

As a result, cell phones have caused automobile accidents which have unfortunately led to deaths.

In my opinion, drives should not be able to use cell phones if they are held in ones hand, however, they should be allowed to use cell phones in ""hands free"" mode as follows while operating a vehicle:

1. to talk and/or talk text via Bluetooth, 2. to use maps and/or a navigation system and 3. for entertainment purposes such as listening to music and the ability to watch movies, especially during cross county travel.

Talking and texting while driving has become a ""hot topic"" in recent years mainly because of more and more humans using cell phones on a daily basis and the rise in traffic accidents due to talking and/or texting. I will agree that drivers can get distracted while talking on the cell phone while using their hands.

I will also agree that drivers can get distracted by using their hands to text because the driver is constantly looking up and down which results in loss of concentration and attention to other drivers and to the road. However, a solution to the problem would be to mandate that all drives must use ""hands free"" mode via Bluetooth or you will be in violation of the law and can get a traffic ticket if seen using your hands.

Before the cell phone, humans used actual paper maps to navigate the world.

Until the early 2000's when cell phones came with satellite navigation via Goggle maps, software and apps such as MapQuest and Waze which allow the driver to get directions to their destinations via the cell phone.

Navigation systems usually speak to the driver via the sound system in the vehicle which allow the driver to not use their hands.

However, there are times that drivers use their hands to see the maps, therefore resulting in a traffic accidents. A solution to this issue would be to require all drivers to use the ""hands free"" mode while using navigation systems.

The Internet has allowed for cell phones to have the ability to play radio stations from all over the country and not just local radio stations.

The Internet has also allowed for humans to download their favorite music to their cell phones which they can then listen to the music via the phone.

The Internet has also given humans the ability to watch television and movies via the cell phone by using apps such as YouTube and Netflix.

Music has probably least likely to cause drivers to get distracted.

However, movies have most likely caused traffic accidents because the driver looks up and down at the screen losing concentration while driving.

A solution to this problem would be that the driver can only listen to music while driving and only the passengers can watch movies while the driver is driving, which are all ""hands free"" solutions.

In conclusion, it is my opinion that drivers should be able to use cell phones in the capacity of ""hands free"" mode while operation a vehicle.

The actual cell phone device is really not the issue that causes traffic accidents, it is basically the user lacking concentration, not paying attention and not using hands free mode that causes traffic accidents.

Although humans will still get into traffic accidents while using ""hands free"" mode while operation a vehicle, it will most certainly cut down the number of accidents in the United States and around the world.            ",0,0.028654322,0,True

A positive attitude is the key to success in life? Attitude is a behavior that people has inside of them, and is impossible to see it, but by action you can tell. A person may born without attitude, but parents are one reason to teach their children to have an excellent attitude. A positive attitude is the key to success in life, because it assist to live with different people in world, and gives other a desire to impress someone who have a positive attitude.

First, a positive attitude is the key in life because, people loves someone who is kind and helpful. Having a better attitude in front of community make people feel pride. For example, school there is different people from different countries, and they have their own behavior. some student doesn't like to talk to other, and It gives them a hard time to learn new things in life. Without thinking attitude prove what kind of person he or she is.

Secondly, a positive attitude is the key to success in life, because it may entice people to see other are important, and being able to help each other. For instance, doctors they have an opportunity to keep a person alive. They do all of that because of their adorable attitude; and care a lot about another people's life. Small thing can make a difference in the world.

Nevertheless, some people say a positive attitude is not the key to success in life. They argue that thus born with positive attitude, but they start to change themselves later. The point has merit, because not all people has positive attitude success in life, some of them are struggle. However, positive attitude benefits people to receive a lot of knowledge, and become more successful. Therefore, positive attitude can give a person chances, to make connection with different people.

To conclude, positive attitude carry the mean of being a human. Because you can't say you're a good person with negative attitude. It's necessary to have a quality attitude, that may persuade other to change theirs. Lastly,

7949A941BF0F,"What is success without failure?

I can infer that the mentioned statement Prime Minister Winston had provided has an strong point of view from many perspectives. Human behavior mostly influences in their achievements and failures throughout life. To be able to achieved your expected goals without loosing enthusiasm, and demonstrating resilience is the greatest accomplishment. I strongly agree with the Churchill's statement regardless to the critical role failure plays in life. It gives the enthusiasm every individuals need in order to be successful in life, it motivates young minds to follow their expectations, and provides more knowledge in many cases since we learn from our mistakes.

Accordingly to many researches, individuals tend to give up when they are facing an obstacle in a complicated occasion, that prevented most of society to stop achieving their accomplishments due to the constant fear of experiencing failure. Society has been exacerbating this concept by creating irrational fear in those who are not willing to take risks to become better persons once they seemed to have failed, which leads to the mediocrity of the world.

Furthermore, there are many people who were born in a extremely poor region, yet they became successful persons due to the hard work they constantly showed and the multiple failures they have experienced, that helped them work harder on specific goals, and that have made an enormous impact in many young minds since it exposes how someone could be able to achieved anything they are expecting, if you keep trying. If individuals were to give up in the first try, we would be a world with ignorant in it.

Moreover, It is psychological proven that a brain can effectively works in better conditions, if they seem to be in a place where failure could be the main issue. We, as humans tend to follow other's behavior to feel accepted by society. If we keep encouraging people to practice resilience, they would most likely be able to manage every hard situation in life and would have the courage to keep trying even if they are aware they might fail, in other words, they would be practicing negative reinforcement that is based on failing but being aware they could have rewards at the end.

Overall, Failure plays an essential role in the pursuit of success since it gives individuals the challenge of becoming better human being and achieving their goals regardless to the situation. It exposes how human behavior react with the idea that success is not only one extraordinary idea. Success means being able to manage the situation with resilience and perseverance even if they seem to have made multiple mistakes. It influences in many adolescences, gives the hope of being able to achieved their expected accomplishments and it provides higher knowledge from their mistakes.

However that is not necessarily true, because just like there are benefits to having a car, there are benefits to limiting car usage.

For example, in Vauban, germany 70 percent of the family's in the community do not own any vehicle as a result of street parking, driveways and home garages being generally forbidden, and 57 percent have sold their car to move there. A benefit that has come from cars being banned is some like Heidrun Wlater, a media trainer and mother of two, felt much happier without a car as opposed to when she had a car she always felt tense.

However, Vauban is not the only community that has used a movement called ""smart planning"", which is the separation of suburban life from auto use. The trend is growing in Europe, in the United States, as well as other places. Experts say that the method is an effort to greatly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe. In places like Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. While places in the United States that has a high car usage number is responsible for 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions.

In addition to greenhouse gas emissions, the usage of cars is causing smog in places, such as Paris, where driving has been ban due to days of having a nearrecord pollution. However, with the exception of usage for plugin cars, hybird, and cars carrying three or more passengers. According to Reuters, research shows that Paris has more smog than other European capital. As a result of the ban, car traffic was down 60 percent in the capital. Furthermore, many delivery companies lost revenue. However, the benefit to ban of the usage of cars is the smog cleared up enough for the ruling French party to lift off the ban on oddnumber plates on Tuesday.

Moreover, just like in Europe, in the United States, President Obama wishes to reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions produce. The United States is wellknown for its car culture. However, research has shown that Americans are buying less cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as the years go by. Part of the reason for this outcome is the result of the recession, which led to Americans not being able to buy new cars and unemployed did not need the use of the car since they were not going to work anyways. If the pattern of the usage of cars continues the way it's going many sociologist belive it will have a beneficial use on the reduction of carbon emissions and the environment.

(https://www. edgarsnyder. com/car-accident/cause-of-accident/cell-phone/cell-phone-statistics. html) One out of every four crashes is, all in all, caused by somebody being so distracted and sucked in by their phone. When are people going to realize that using any kind of cellular device while driving is a distraction so dangerous, it could cost others their lives, as well as their own? Is sending that one text really worth dying over? People need to see the dangers of using cell phones while driving. It has become such a giant problem, and it needs to be stopped. Drivers should be prohibited from handling or looking at their phones while driving.

Teens are the most likely case of texting and driving. Nowadays, teens feel the need to always have their eyes glued to their phone screen. Who can blame them? Social media and texting are some of the main methods of communication in 2018. On the contrary, teens are irresponsible and choose to catch up with their friends online at the wrong time. On top of being inexperienced drivers, they are constantly taking their eyes off the road to check their cell phone. Teens especially should be taught the dangers of using phones while driving; how one text can change not only your life, but everybody else's around you.

Everybody has been late to work, school, or anything else at some point in their lives. They are rushing and they go out the door, driving a little faster than they normally would, trying to get to their destination on time. Now, add a phone to this situation. According to the Edgar Snyder law firm, texting while driving has a ""400 percent increase in time spent with eyes off the road."" (https://www. edgarsnyder. com/car-accident/cause-of-accident/cell-phone/cell-phone-statistics. html) Alongside being in a hurry, the person who is late to work is now endangering themselves and others.

What if, maybe, the person driving was not the culprit of using phones while driving? Already in a rush, they are trying to get to work on time, and they are struck by a careless driver, who was changing the song they were listening to on their phone.

Every year, with the advance in use of technology, there are more and more accidents involving phones. ""In 2015, 391,000 people were injured in motor vehicle crashes involving distracted drivers."" Of those people, 3,477 died. That may seem like a small chunk, but those are lives that did not need to be lost. Simply putting your phone down and waiting could have saved somebody. In schools, there needs to be an organized plan to teach kids about these kinds of dangers. This needs to happen soon, especially for high schoolers, who are at the age where they are learning to drive, and also the most involved in technology and their phones.

To conclude, drivers, no matter the age or experience, should not be able to use their phones at all while driving. There have been too many countless deaths and injuries related to phones and driving. This can be prevented by implementing a system in schools to teach about the dangers of phone use while driving. There should also be a course in Drivers Education, whether online or in schools, strictly on phone use. Any person of any age should be able to learn the dangers of texting, changing music, taking pictures, etc. while behind the wheel.

07A627DF99A4,"Fellow citizens should know about the advantages of limiting car usage. It is less stressful and it saves money. It does not pollute the air as much and keeps the global healthier. Limiting the car usage helps a alot to the citizens and to the earth.

One advantage of limiting car usage is that it is less stressful and it helps you save money. From source 1, Hedirun Walter said "" When I had a car I was always tense."" In the community you could own a car but you were not allowed to park wherever you wanted. You had to park it in large garages and you have to buy space for $40,000 with a home. So most people didn't have cars but they were saving lots of money. 70 percent of vauban's families do not own cars and 57 percent sold there cars to move to the community. Most of the people liked walking around the community or just taking the transportation they gave them. It peaceful and less traffic.

Another advantage is that it reduces pollution and also reduces global warming. From source 2, ""After days of near-record pollution, paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" If they did not leave thier cars at home they would have to pay a fine, 22-euro ($31). After they have had the cars off the streets ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the of france, after five-days of intensifying smog..."" The cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer to trap car emissions. They also blamed the diesel fuel...""A tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vechicles in france, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines..""

From source 3, Colombia had a ""car-free day"" where all colombians hiked, biked, skated or took the transportion buses to work. For 3 years they have been doing this being they wanted to reuduce the smog. People who disobeyed had to pay $25 fines. "" It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,""said businessman Carlos Arthuro. Since people have started waliking or riding bicyles, they have improved the city by fixing the uneven sidewalks and making them smooth. Also since there is no traffic, "" new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.""

In conclusion, there are many advantages limiting car usage. It saves money, helps the enviroment and a human's health. Limiting the car usage teaches the citizens that we also have to car about the enviroment and that is it less dangerous.    ",0,0.0070454977,0,True
CAE63BBF4546,"Do you know what the challenge of Exploring Venus is? Well venus is the second planet from our sun. Venus distance but safe vantage point of Earth has very challenging place to examine more closely. They also often called Venus as the Earth's Twin. Let's see what The Challenge of Exploring Venus is all about.

First of all,

Earth, Venus , Mars are like neighbor that orbits the sun at different speeds. The differences in speed that we are closer to Mars than other times to Venus. Venus is sometimes right around the corner in space terms. Humans has numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud -draped world. Since no spacecraft survived the landing for more tha a few hours.

Secondly, The thick atmosphere is almost 97% of carbon dioxide that blankets Venus. The more challenging are the clouds of highly sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. The planet's temps are average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than our own planet. The conditions on Earth are far more extreme than anything humans encounter.

Thirdly,

NASA has one particularly compelling ideas to send humans to study Venus. NASA's solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus allow scientist to float above the fray. Researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Many researchers are working on innovations that allows our machines to last long enough to knowledge Venus. NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus.

In a conclusion, Do you know what the challenge of Exploring Venus is? Well, Earth, Venus , Mars are like neighbor that orbits the sun at different speeds. The thick atmosphere is almost 97% of carbon dioxide that blankets Venus. NASA has one particularly compelling ideas to send humans to study Venus. So however, I just exploring about Venus so I think I past the challenge.         ",0,0.008059395,0,True
C3D3379F894C,"Dear Florida Senator,

I believe that we should not have the Electoral College no more. We are giving people false hopes that there vote counts when it really does not. We see on TV ads that we should vote and let our voices be heard but when in reality it is not. Didn't Lincoln once say ""A nation founded by the people for the people by the people...""  he was saying that we should let people have a a voice in everything that happens in America, but we can not even have a voice in who we wanted as president.

We give all the power to the Electoral College but not to the people. In 2000 Al Gore won the popular votes but lost the presidency. What type of system is this where we vote for who we want  but get who we do not want. What the whole reason to vote if the Electoral College vote is more important then our. Beside voting for the president we want we vote for the slate of electors who elect the president. We don't even know who these mysterious Electoral College are they can vote for a president just because he is in the Democratic Party,we have no ideas why.

In 2000 we had the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse when it came to Electoral College. ""Consider that state legislatures was technically responsible for the picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency. The people vote was not heard in that year,because they wanted Al Gore respresenting by the Democratic Party but we got Geroge W. Bush. I have never heard of a more unfair voting system before. Where were our rights the freedom of speech then, it was no where to be found. I feel that voting for who never we want should be in the Bill of Rights. So it okay to a gun for safety in our bag but itnot okay to vote for what we want.

On most basic level, the Electoral College is unfair to voters, because of the winner-take-all-system in each state. Some candidates do not spend that much time in states they know they have no chance of winning. In 2000 campaign, seventeen states did not get to see Geroge Bush or Al Gore these states were Rhodes Island with 3 electoral votes and South Carolina with 9 electoral votes. Candidates mostly only visit the states with the most like Florida with 29 and Texas with 38. They do not care about the other states they only care about who have the most electoral votes.

Each party selects slate of electoral they trust to vote for the party nominee and they have rarely been betrayed. It is could be true that the winner of electoral  vote will not win base off of the national popular vote. But it is most likely not to happen again like in 2000 when Al Gore had more popular votes then Bush. The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. So no Electoral can have a solid favorite they must vote on who would most likely chance America for the better.

But if the Al Gore vs. Bush happen once what stop it for happening again the reason why it happen was because we had Electoral College so to stop it. We Must stop it.

Florida state Senator as much of a good idea it is to have at some point in time it will go wrong. All good things, have bad endings. So I think it better to stop it now before things for the wrongs like Americans just stop voting becasue we all know our votes do not mean a thing when it come to Electoral College votes.            ",0,0.007341127,0,True
695d8e0f,"There are many advantages to limiting car usage aroung the world. When it comes to our economic problems cars are producing more and more pollution and destroying our OZone layer. Many different countries are making differences by having car free cities where you only have few cars or none and creating a safer street for the people and cleaning up and repairing the sidewalks. Paris has a lot of Diesel fueled cars and the pollution got so bad they had to ban cars for a couple days to be able to clear the air because how bad the smog was getting and anyone who didn listen to this rule was fined and if were caught driving had the opportunity to get their car impounded and towed away. The United States also have the same problems when you look at the statistics car usage is dropping in the U.S even though the population is growing. Even though this is benefitting the economy there is still a lot of pollution occurring.

Source A shows us that in this experimental area ""Vauban"" almost everyone has given up their cars to live in this suburban location. ""vaughn's streets are completely car free"" according to author Elisabeth Rosenthal. She claims to have become a lot less stressful when she gave up her car to live in this area. She says that in Vabuan there is a lot less cramp and not much traffic at all because of the car free streets. Now everyone rides bikes around to get to places or even just walk, because of this the sidewalks were all repaired when the experiment was started and made everything presentable. Also when this experiment was completed in 2006 Businesses were opened just walking distances away from residents, so that people would be comfortable living in this town. Source A shows that private owned cars are choking cities because of all the fumes that are being created by cars and trucks and all motored vehicles. Passenger cars are responsible for more than half of all Greenhouse emissions in the united states, and since there is a lot of Greenhouse fumes being created the environmental Protection Agency in the U.S. is promoting car reduced communities. Yes, it is only one small way to change how the future of our world is going to be but it will make a change.

In Paris, France there was a temporary car ban because of how bad the situation was getting. A smog was created and covering all the skies and was a frightening view to see. So the government went on and created a ban with specific rules. On one day the Cars with even numbered license plates would not be allowed to be driven and on the next day it would be odd numbered license plates were the ones that weren't allowed to be driven. If any person were to disobey this law and take the car out of their homes and caught by an official they would be fined and have the vehicle towed and impounded. Causing the person to have to spend more money and get the car back. This ban was eventually lifted as the skies cleared and everything went back to normal. Bogota has a car free day every year which is set to be a day where everyone walks aroung or ride bikes, skate, or hiked around everywhere all for the ecosystem to be able to recover at least for 24 hours. Because of this one day, bycicle lanes have been created and sidewalks have also been repaired. Making it a safe place for people to be able to get around. This is a very effective way of recovering the damage that was once done by the cars that our own people use.

In the United States studies show that all though the population is increasing car usage is dropping and not as many cars are being bought and used like before. studies also show that as every year passes less and less americans are getting licenses and buying cars. Some may say that it is because of the economic problems a lot of the Americans are going through with the money limitations or if it is just a personal choice. Either way car reduction means less pollution and it is all benefitting our planet. According to source 4 as of 2013 the number of miles driven per person is 9 percent below the peak which almost ties the amount of miles driven per person in 1995 when a lot less people were even alive.

All in all Car reduction programs and bans on cars on certain days all benefit the OZone layer and should be done annually to be able to help our ecosystem. This is a very effective method to use and I feel as if all of the world should adopt this ideology and use it as it has statistically shown effectiveness.",0,0.0071556405,0,True
A5C0F9067500,"Dear Senator,

I think you need to change it to where the election goes by popular vote for the president of the United States. It's not fair to have electoral college. The people that have to obide by the president should be able too choose who thier president is. I can see where people like the electoral college because the electors get to choose and it has to be a majority of 270 electoral votes. I also don't like the fact that all of the states get a different amount of electoral votes. Claifornia gets the most amount of electoral votes, it gets 55. But there are a few states that only get three or four. All of the states should get an equal amout of votes, We are the 'United' states, arnt we?

The idea of the common adult (over the age of 18) being able to vote is a good way to let us keep our say in things, especially if we get to choose who the president is going to be. Once again, I think you should change it to popular vote for the president of the United States.     ",0,0.006943039,0,True

If people are checking up on this everday and keeping watch you would be able to see these ""aliens"". So when you think of it getting made by aliens its probaly not the best choice if you have no proof.

If it was made up by aliens then why is it not looking like a face more and more when we look more in to it. We got proof that it isn't made from an alien, ""New high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASA'S Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what really is: A mesa.""

Those scientests didn't look in to it because it says ""become a pop icon"" and people think that they know stuff about it and really they don't. You gotta look into it before making a big deal about it.

19A29F7C42CA,"What is it? ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" is an article that explains to us what the face on Mars actually is. The ""face"" on Mars is actually a type of landform called a mesa. It was proven to us by the revealing in 1998 and the 2001 image.

On April 5, 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia while Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) took pictures of the landform. The pictures were ten times sharper than the one picture the Vikings had revealed. When the image had first appeared on the JPL wedsite, thousands of anxious web surfers were disappointed. The image revealed that the ""face"" was actually a natural landform. ""There was no alien monument after all.""

It was a cloudless summer day in Cydonia on April 8, 2001, when the Mars Global Surveyor was able to get close enough to the landform to snap a picture. ""We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field view,"" said Garvin. The team had captured a clear picture using the camera's maximum resolution. ""Each pixel in 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" That image proved all those wrong of who thought of it to be a ""face.""

So, the ""face"" on Mars is actually a type of lanfrom called a mesa due to the revealing in 1998 and the 2001 image. Both of those images proved to us that the ""face"" was not a face or an alien monument, but an actual landform. Also, if your able to comapre it to another landform, like in paragraph 12, then you understand it pretty well to know what it actually is if you've done the research.

A1C00871518B,"Some students are offered distance learning from their schools. Students can work from home or video conferences with their instructors. Learning from home can make students miss out on opportunities they could have in school, like bettering their social skills and obtaining information needed for reality.

For example, learning from home makes students miss out on opportunities they could experience in school. Going to dances and making new friends. Missing out on the opportunities to see the fundamentals of school life. Learning from home limits students chances to use their social skills. Social skills that can prepare students for life. For example, getting a job. Therefore, students should attend school. Attending school gives students the benefit to make friends.

Another example, not being able to obtain the information needed for reality. There is a lot of information taught in classes. For example, the Fundamentals of Algebra or Reading. Information taught in these class courses are not all useless, but necessary. What is taught can help prepare students for a career dealing with that course. For example, being a biologist. The information taught in biology class can be of usage. Therefore, students should attend school rather than doing school from home.

Although, some might say that attending school from home is an appropriate option. Due to students feeling more safer at home or they have more independence at home. The purpose of school is for guiding students into being a greater mold of themselves. School helps you adapt to lifestyle. Without school, students will fail in life.

In conclusion, distance learning is used for students to learn at home. Which is not really beneficial to students. Students will miss out on opportunities of bettering their social skills and will lack the information taught in schools needed for career. ",0,0.008121712,0,True

D39D282DE3FE,"The three warmest months of the year are considered as time off from school for students in the U.S and other countries. Even though these students aren't in school, they are still required to learn during their break. However, in many schools, the students are assigned a boring, uneventful activity that they feel as if they have no choice but to do. Reasons such as this are why students should be able to design their own summer projects; these tasks that they create for themselves can be used as an outlet for creativity, show signs of independence, and they can be used as a way of teaching responsibility.

One reason students should be able to design their own summer assignments is that they can be used as creative outlets. Many private performance arts schools require that their students create an art piece that corresponds with their fields of study. For example, photography and art students are told that they are to paint, photograph, design, etc anything they wish over break; that they have complete say in what they do. But, whatever work that they submit will be entered into their school portfolio (which is a collection of a students or artists best work). Being given free range of what they can do gives the student the chance to be as creative as they can be. And in many cases such as these, the pieces that the students are able to be the most creative on are some of their best work.

Another reason students should be able to create their own summer projects is because it can a be sign of independence. Being given an assignment and being told that they have to do it in a specific way can be boring to a teenager, especially one going through their rebellious phase. Yet, if a teenager were given the chance to make their own choices, it would give them the opportunity to test their indepencence. Such as being able to choose what they get to do for their project and how they decide to do it. This small, simple opportunity can show a student what it's like to test themselves and have complete control over what they do instead of being told.

Finally, students would benefit from designing their own summer break assignments because of the responsibility that it would ensue. Summer break is thought of as a time for fun and relaxation for just about all students, especially high schoolers. So the idea of being assigned piles of homework or a large project can cause a student to either want to shutdown or just completely avoid it all together. However, if a student were able to choose what they do for their work, in many cases, it will cause them to actually want to do it. It can make the student stop and think about what they have to work on, and then they will (typically) either stop what theyr'e doing to work on it, or they will set aside a certain time that they'll do it. The thought of ""oh, I have to go do my work"" will cross their mind because they actually want to do it, then causing them to make their work a priority.

Now, it is well know that many students need the structure that comes along with the teacher-designed projects because it can be harder for some to come up with ideas, but more often than not, that is not the case. Students leave school for three months just to be loaded down with extra homework; saying that they have no choice but to do it will either cause a teenager to go stir crazy, or they become extremely unmotivated to do any of it at all. However, if given the chance to make their own decisions on how to do their project, a student would feel more motivated to do the work because it's their choice on what's being done. All in all, it would be more beneficial for students to create their own projects rather than a mandetory, teacher-designed one due to the sheer facts that it would be a way for students to be more creative, it would give the students the chance to be more independent, and finally, it can be a way to teach students how to be more responsible.",0,0.013180538,0,True
8942805E4E33,"Phones and driving

Drivers shouldn't be able to use their cell phones because it can cause so many problems, if they are being distracted they could cause an accident, they could run someone over, and they can also cause big problems. All this can be stopped but many people don't really care enough for that, even if there has been a law passed they still will keep texting and driving.

The people that text and drive are mostly teens, they never seem to put their phones down. Many teens have died from texting while driving, but that will never put an effect to the teens. You can tell a teen to stop texting and driving but they will never listen, they will keep doing it till they end up in an accident. About 1,300,000 are killed by car accidents, most of them are caused by distracted drivers. Many people do get killed by the accident but many are left disabled, meaning they won't be able to walk for years, but they are also left with the memory of them getting ran over. So many people nowadays stay on their phone, a text can wait. If you're are a traffic light, that text can wait till you're at your destination. Yes, there are many impatient people,but they should understand there are many people dying by one simple text, or a simple call.

By being distracted by their phone, they don't pay attention. A teen can look down for a quick second and they could run over a kid. Many people need to realize that texting while driving can cost a lot, it can cost someone's life.

Even adults end up killing children. If you can't wait to send a text after you finish driving, then you shouldn't be driving at all. You can seriously end up killing one person over one simple little text that can wait. About 55 million people die a year, about a million of them are from texting and driving. There are many people that end up getting run over, but most of them are because the driver is distracted by their phone. Many people can deny that they wasn't texting and driving but little they know that there is a camera at every traffic light now. Georgia passed a law about using their phone while driving, it caused more police to be out on the roads, protecting and watching who is using their phones.

Texting and driving can cause many problem, it's not just accidents or running people over. The ticket they get can be paid off but they will keep using their phone no matter what. Teens are the main ones that use their phones while driving to show off they have a car or to show off they can drive. I personally have a cousin that drives and uses his phone, many times i had to take his phone away to keep him from getting us in an accident. He will never listen till it happens to him. Therefore the law does nothing really, it won't stop people from using their phones. They will keep using their phones till they end up causing an accident or actually killing someone.

Using the phone while driving is very dangerous, but no one will listen till it happens to them. Many people die a day, if we don't hear it on the news, it happens no matter what. If ever accident was on the news you will see how many people keep driving and texting, they will see how many people have died from that. We should have something to keep them from texting and driving, even calling someone can cause an accident. The people who are on their phones while driving can cause traffic or an accident.

04D653441263,"Online education has always been a controversial subject with the risk of not understanding the material, and students getting answers from their peers most of the popluation seem to be against the possibility. However, I believe there are new ways to look at the subject. The pros for online education are very proactive to the needed change in the school system these things are flexibility, time management and, mental health.

As a current student at a in person educational school, I have first-hand experience on how time consuming school may 6 be. An online education means that you are being told what you need to have done here before a certain time and, how you are expected to do so. It throws away the possibility of time consuming dialogue that students may have with other students or the teachers getting off topic with a personal story. Doing these little things that happen frequently can turn an 8 hour system into 3 hours. In the mist of giving these students 5 more hours in the day that is 5 more hours for students to work, hang out with friends, do chores and etc. These little things let us teenagers be teenagers just a little while longer. Adding to things such as, the employment rate, students taking college classes during high school, and the amount of teens volunteering. It gives teen the ability to be more flexible with their lives which is what we should strive for.

Secondly, When giving a student their own time to finish their work and nothing but the guilt of not getting a good grade being their motivation, there will always linger the question of ""Will they get it done?"". To that I asked, is school not meant to teach us the tools we need to survive the ""adult world""? As teenagers we are always told to learn the importance of time management before we get into our careers and even college. However, there are no courses for these types of things but, instead we are expected to learn them through first-hand experience and natural growth. This online school will teach students their obvious subjects such as Math, English and etc but they will subconsciously teach the importance of time management. Students will be expected to finish these lessons on their own because, if a teens prefers to do their work early in the morning in about 2-3 hours does it matter that they're possible hanging with their friends all night. These helps us teens understand the importance of time management without throwing it in their face they subconsciously come to that conclusion on their own.

Lastly, the importance of mental health in the education system is lacking and to be quite blunt is part of the problem. Most, adults may argue that this is a false narrative because of the of outlets that the education system may offer to students. However, my question is ""Do these outlets reach out and succeeded to out way the bullying and stress of a normal public school?""

because the answer is ""No."". As student at a public school the amount of work that is pilled on and the emotional stress of bullying enough to fall into depression. However, these problem turn into other problems for example, as a teenager your friends become and big part of your life in terms of what makes you happiest. What the current education system fails to realize is that two days of seven are not enough to truly cherish your time. Online school eliminates the possibility of those students who are to busy because of school work and because of it have no social life.

To concluded, Online school is and will most likely always be a controversial topic for as long as those who have been to in person school are around. However, I believe it's a matter of noticing that the pros of this new way of thinking out way the cons. These truly serious issues are being over looked because our older generation are extremely set on the mind-set that all generations need to grown up as they did. Let's look to innvoatote new ways. ",0,0.006966193,0,True

Although, it would be fundamental to have a teacher in charge of the summer projects, it wouldnt be beneficial for the students. Making the environment feel more like summer rather than a regular school day.

Having an idea of what connects the students to each other they are given the opportunity to create plans and project ideas around how others learn, with them being students themselves and having a sense of how their peers work it makes it easier to come up with these project ideas. This allows them to gain social skills, get a better understanding of the project, and how to properly execute the task at hand.

Also, allowing them to design the project gives them a sense of responsibility, the chance to show how to be a leader and to show their maturity level as well as how well they work when it comes to group or individual activities especially projects. This helps to build character toward a students leadership skills that can be used in the future and whether their work ethic is applied more in groups or individually.

Lastly, the overall fun of leading and designing a project for your classmates and getting to know what each other like and dislike within a project and picking topics that everyone can either relate to or just find excitement in. Since students usually understand what each other enjoy about projects they can rule out the difficulties of planning and have fun doing the project while balancing work with enjoyment. This allows Students to do the project with enthusiasm instead of being bored and miserable from getting a project topic they never wanted and without executing it in a way that would add their uniqueness to it.

By using alternative transportation, such as buses, taxis, biking or even walking, the amount of greenhouse emission is drastically reduced.

This will cut the amount of money spent yearly by U.S. citizens and the government as a whole, reducing the federal transportation bill. Rosenthal 1 Paris, too, momentarily banned driving due to smog. Paris enforced a driving ban that lasted a few days to clear the city's air after a close call to record pollution.

But in the artical it gives us an example of if a student is confused or if a student looks mad or angry, the new software would explain the steps over until the student understands. The way I see it for example a student is working on a problem and the see something unusal in the problem and makes a confused face for a least a second the prgram would explain it to them. The student knows how to do the problem and knows how to solve it already but the program brought up step to exaplain it anyway. It would be useless the student could have soveld it already and would have been to the next problem but the Facial Action Coding System got in the students way just to show them how to do something they already know.

In the artical it also tells us to look in a minor or at a friend and make a ""smiling face"". The friend would see that you are happy yes, but we were told to make that face we had no desire to make that face happy or not, we just made the face, it was a forced smile. In the artical also it says that the computer program would be able to tell a force smile from a genuingly happy smile which what I just explaind that a smile is easy to manipulate. The program could be taking in false information and the program itself would not even know it.

In the artical it also exaplains that ads. That if a ad were to pop up and you would smile the prgram would show another ad just like the previous one and visvursa. The real question is have you ever ever seen a ad so many times that you become angry or frustrated and you smile because the ""Skip ad"" timer is getting closer and closer to zero the ""FAC"" would miss-understand your face and bring another ad just like that one.

1F1036C2B418,"Did you know that only 10% of students in Generic_City participate in at least one extracurricular activity and only 4% of students at Generic_School as a sport, joining the yearbook committee, serving the student council, or any after school club, the students at Generic_School would become more involved in their community and want to help their community for the better. A study done by Harvard University in 2017 proved that only 30% of the students in Virginia participate in at least one extracurricular activity and of those students, 28% are active in their community and have helped their communities by fund raising for an important cause, petitioning for changes in their communities, and encouraging good habits such as recycling and healthy eating habits. Although this percentage of students in Virginia is very low, the rate of students who are active in their community is very high, based on these numbers. This proves that if our students participate in extracurricular activities, they are also more likely to impact their communities for the better which is why we need this policy in our school. Not only could the students at Generic_School impact their communities for the better, but participating in extracurricular activities could also help our students make new friends and find new interests.

By requiring our young learners to participate in an extracurricular activity, we are also encouraging them to reach outside of their comfort zones and try something new. This new activity could help them make new friends and they may even find new and exciting interests that they never new they would like. If our students stuck to the same routine every day and never tried anything new, they may never find any activities that may excite them and spark new interests in them. Therefore, our students would start to become bored in school and feel less encouraged to do well and study hard to get good grades. When I was in the beginning of fifth grade, I felt excited to start off a new and fun year as a fifth grader. This excitement slowly started to wear off a quarter way through the year and I started to feel less encouraged to continue working hard and striving to get the best grades that I could. I was beginning to feel bored with the same routine that I had maintained over the past few years and I hoped that I could try something new and refreshing that would make me more excited about school and my everyday life. One day, my mom asked me if I wanted to try a dance class at a studio that I had never heard of. Out of pure excitement, I agreed and that whole week, I was looking forward to the day that I would go to dance class. When the day of the class came, I was shy, but I managed to make friends with all of the girls and I had found a new interest in dance. Not only did this new experience help me make new friends and find a new interest, but it also made me feel encouraged in school to keep working hard throughout the week until my weekly dance class on Saturday. My grades started to go up and I was more happy and encouraged to do well in everything I did. This new dance class had helped me find new friends, find a new interest, and get better grades. To this day, I still dance and I could not imagine my life without it. Not only does requiring our students to participate in a new activity help them find new interests and make friends, but it also could help our students get into good schools in the future, and therefore get better jobs and become more successful.

By requiring our students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity, we could also be helping these students get into good colleges and we could be setting them up for a very bright future. With this new policy, our students will be able to add to their resumes that they have participated in a variety of activities that may seem very impressive to college school boards, as they tend to find interest in students who have a variety of extracurricular activities. After going to a great college, our students will be sent into interviews for jobs. With their resumes saying that they went to an impressive college, they will be accepted into their dream jobs. This amazing future for our students is all because of this policy. Without it, we would be denying our students from the future they deserve. A study by Yale University in 2018 has shown that 80% of colleges base their acceptances of students based on the variety of extracurricular activities that they are in. This proves that with our new policy, we could be helping our students get into better schools. Not only will this policy help our students have a bright future, but it will also help them become better students and adults in the future.

Generic_School needs to require our students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it would help our students become more active and involved in their communities, it would help them make new friends and help them find new interests, and it would help our students get into good colleges and get good jobs, leading them to the bright futures that they deserve.

What should happen about the phones and driving issues plaguing society.

As humans in our time we revolve around our phones at almost all times. From texting and long distance calls to games and GPS it has a connection to our phone. Driving already is dangerous because of all the imperfections we carry. We need to be alert at all times because if we lose focus for a bit that portion of time will ruin a life.

When we drive our phones should be used for GPS only or for emergency phone calls. We have fatalities and injuries being born from use of phones while in a vehicle that is in motion. There may be a wide array of factors that go into causing a wreck it's understandable.

Your focus is what allows you to react to a sudden situation, if and when you lose focus you may meet a surprise motorist that wants to say hello. Anything that is done will upset someone while satisfying another. Improvement MUST be made at the basic level of human thought if we are to increase safety of drivers.

The best outcome is to reduce the reason to be on the phones and say no to this addiction.

The Electoral College has been around since America was born. The founding fathers established it in the Consititution. Yes, there are some problems and concern with the Electoal College, but aren't there problems with everything in the world today? The pronalems can be fixed with some time and effort, and in my opiniion the Electoral College is more beneficial to the election process than harmful.

The Electoral College was created as a compromise and was agreed on by many. Some things people don't like about the Electoral College is that it's like a ""winner-take-all"" system, becuse then canidates don't spend time in states they know they're not going to win. But, with the winner-take-all system we will have a certain outcome with no disputes. This gives the canidate a landslide electoral-vote victory in a state. Also, the artice,""

In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President""

says, ""There is no pressue for a run-off election when no canidate wins a majority of the votes casts; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential elecrion process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winer.""

Another concern with the Electoral College that people have is that voters aren't voting for the president, they're voting for the slate of electors, who elect the presodent. But, each party selects a slate of electors who votes for the party's nominee. We the people get to choose our slate of electors, so you get to choose who gets to vote for the president of your choice, which is fair. And, just because the canidate you didn't vote for wins the electoral vote, that doesn't mean they will win the national popular vote. For example, in 2000, Gore haad more popular votes than Bush, yet fewer electoral votes and we all know Bush still won.

The Electoral College also give ""swing"" states to play A HUGE role in the voting process. Most canidates focus their campaign efforts of the toss-up states, because the winner-take-all system. The swing states decide who the next president will be. They already know the states that they will get votes from, but the swing states are never consitant and always win someone the election. Also, states with a bigger population have more electoral votes, and by this the Electoal College restores some weight in the political balance by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate ddecreed in the Constitution.

All-in-all, The Electoral College has more positives than negatives in these situations. It helps us have a certain winner, avoid runn-off elections, choose who we want to win the election, and gives states power. The Electoal College was put in the Constitution, and so poeple like Thomas Jefferson thoughht it was important that we have an election system like the Electoral College. In my opinion, whe you weigh out allthe pros and cons about the Electoral College the pros weight out all the cons. And, if there was a different system there would always be problems with that. People always try to find problems with everything, and you can never pleas everyone these days.

Asking people for their advice about what you should do or which one to pick, can help you make a better choice. When you wanna ever ask someone for advice make sure you ask multiple people because they might incoredge or persuade you to do something that you had a hard choice doing,itÃÂ´ll help you understand why you should do it or not and because some people might not have the best advice for you. Let me tell you why.

First asking multiple people for advice will inceredge or persuade you to do it because of there advice. Lets say that your confused about doing something so you ask multiple people for advice. So after asking many people for advice you realize that multiple people actually persuaded you to do it. And when your persuaded about doing something then it would be less difficult to do what ever you were confused about.

Second thing is that when you ask many people for advice or for there opinion about something actually helps you understand about what you should do. Understanding about what you should do will also incoredge you to not be scared or nervous. Its would also help you understand why you do it which will lead you on to doing it.

And lastly, you should ask multiple people for advice because some people might not even have the right advice for you. Having the right advice is important because you dont want to get the wrong advice from someone and then do it because that would lead to problems. When asking for advice from also make sure that you want to do it. And unless you just want bad advice then I advise you to ask multiple people.

So whenever you want advice or even need it then you should ask multiple people for it.",0,0.006915074,0,True

MONTH_DAY_YEAR

In this essay I will be explaining why the Electoral College shouldn't be kept,and why we should do a popular vote instead to determine the president of the United States.

In my opinion we should do a popular vote because we U.S. citizens know what we want. The Electoral College may know what they want for themselves as a unit but honestly I think that the United States should stick to a popular vote. In an article I read called ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer it states that state legislatures can technically be picking electors that will always defy the will of the people. I notice this to be very unfair because if electors are always going to defy what we say and want why should we vote. Isn't one of America's #1 catch phrases ""

power to the people

"" well in this case it seems to be ""

power to the Electoral Collage

"". In this article it also states that in many cases  ""

faithless

"" electors have ocassionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please! So if the electors can choose for whomever they please why can't we. I also think that the Electoral College is unfair because of the winner-take-all system. Candidates don't have to spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning in. While they go to the states that they know they have a absolute chance of winning in and take those winning votes. So in this case I have to agree with Bob Dole: Abolish the Electoral College!

I also think its wrong that voters can't always control who their voting for because we all the freedom to our own opinions and in the process of the Electoral Collage they are basically just throwing all opinions in the trash. They obviously don't care and I see this as completely irrational and unfair. I know that may use the Elecotoral Collage as a way to keep everyone calm but I think if they were to let the people vote they wouldn't have to be worried about us not being calm because that's us getting what we want and therefore why are we going to complain. I also consider the Electoral Collage electors high class. So in this case they are going to want to vote for the benefit of them, I think this is unfair to the lower-income families because if the electors choose a president that is going to want to take all the benefits away from lower-income families how are they going to live? How are they going to survive.""Remember ""

BDAE1D4B6C20,"The quote, '' hard work pays,'' means a lot when it comes to doing something and one staying idle. The world today upgrades itself each and everyday,which tells us that we should always be doing new everyday as humans.

Although some people say that been idle is the best way to go because it relaxes the body and gives it a new form of strength actually doing something always not only exposes one to new ideas and strategies but also makes the human body active and vibrant at all times. There are a lot of chances one can benefit from been productive other than been idle.

To start with, there are a lot of goodness in been productive than been an idle man. People who invest in their time to produce something meaningful are known across the globe because of their hard work and dedication. Due to how hardworking they are, they get the chance to explore new ways of doing things and new ideas that would help them in their next exploitation. For instance, since Bill Gates is hardworking man, he is known across the globe and due to this he has been exposed to other new things that would help him in whatever he is doing now. Again, when there is a football match between two different teams, and if one team is seen practicing so hard than the other, it would be considered that the team seen practicing the most would deliver more than the other team with no doubt.

Moreover, doing something always makes an individual active and lives longer than been idle. A person who is seen to be doing something productive all the time is considered to be adding more years to his or her age due to the fact that working tirelessly everyday helps keep the body in form and shape which by so doing prevents diseases that attack people. For instance when a person walks about a half and a mile to work everyday, it is very difficult to see that individual get sick because the body is always busy looking for something to do. On the other hand, idleness brings nothing but retrogression and failure because you're not able to bring forth anything productive and therefore it becomes a waste of time,energy and resources. One can make the comparison so easily between a productive person and someone been idle, a productive person can always be seen advancing from one stage to the other while an idle person will be seen at the space that he is at always.

Furthermore, when people say '' time is money,'' they are definitely talking about how one is able to use his available to produce something meaningful for himself to get money and have some other benefits as well. No one gets rich by just sitting at home, folding his hands and just expect something to happen. People may argue on this that one can make it in life when he or she inherits the possession from his family. This may be true because you may have everything to yourself but everything will be squandered if one does not work hard to top it up or add more to what he has. People choose idleness because it is more relaxing and the easiest way to go because you just sit there and wait for whatever happens to happen. Been idle can also affect a person in way or the other. In the sense that, if a person is seen to be at one place all the time, it may be considered that the person may be lazy and this may deprive him off certain opportunities that might help him in one way or the other.

Last but not least, working hard or been productive gets one a recognition or a specific type of award that goes a long way in life. There is no doubt about the fact that people who work hard are awarded the most and are the ones that are shown to the world for others to see and emulate their footsteps. For instance, Usain Bolt has been winning almost all his race in the Olympics and it sends a good message about him to the world because of how hardworking he is. Due to this someone else can decide to emulate his footsteps to become a world star like him.

Again no one chooses to be last in whatever he is doing but rather aims at the high spot. Although some people say that been idle is the best way to go because it relaxes the body and gives it a new form of strength actually doing something always not only exposes one to new ideas and strategies but also makes the human body active and vibrant at all times.

It always good to look at the brighter side of good and it is always advisable to go for what is right. Productivity brings a lot of good things in a person's life than any other thing a person can think of while Idleness brings nothing but retrogression in one's life.",0,0.0070631835,0,True

Extracurricular grants you the responsibility to communicate with others. While doing a club you like you may discover someone who likes the same club. It helps build friendship and creates new friends. This also makes you meet more people who you might have never seen in your life. So extracurricular helps in communication.

So let's think about it. Extracurricular activities can bring fun things like sports or yearbook or fun clubs. It also help's make new friends and lets you meet people you never seen before. It also lets you hangout with old friends. So what you think. Do you say yes or no to your principal?",0,0.0067575425,0,True
2EF823A45135,"There are millions of wrecks in the U.S. every year, some due to their own cars not being very reliable. Cars and their manufacurers must be very reliable when it comes to bringing up new models of vehicles. Imagine if you could cut the number of car wrecks in half. Technology is fast pacing and is advancing every day. What if we could have driverless cars, cars that could not only make the world a better place, but also prove how amazing our technology is. Driverless cars are the next, new future.

Driverless cars have an abundant amount of pros and maybe a little bit of cons, but overall these cars can do great things. A driverless car could possibly stop different aspects of accidents happening. They could even get someone where they need to go. These cars can also help people who barely passed their driver's tests. The car could perform even the most basic stuff, such as, driving through the city, making turns, driving the steering wheel itself, and watching for dangerous things a new or inexperienced driver could not do. Being a new driver can be very challening at first and may even bring a traumatic experience. Coming off as a new driver and only having my license for three months, I know what the pressure can feel like when you feel like you havent learned soemthing and you are already on your own.

There are some cons when it comes to new driverless cars; Let's say someone is in a wreck and later come to find the car had failed them, who is responsible now? The manufacturer. The car could fail out of nowhere with no warning signs and even cost someone their life. Though there have been studies, a driverless car could have a potential downfall affect on drivers. Some could feel like they can be lazy and not have to worry about their surroundings and cause an accident that way; A person could even fall asleep at the wheel and do more damage than good. Some states make it illegal to even drive computer-type cars because of a law they have.

Driverless cars come with baggage on both sides of good and bad, but with a little more knowledge and research it could change someone's opinion overtime. They could potentially save someone's life and other people surrounding them. They could save a new driver's life and could even help them learn all of the skills of the road. With the new techonology we have in this new future, we could cut the wreck numbers in half to seventy five percent. Driverless cars are not a bad idea and they could possibly save this world.

The Facial Coding System detect what your emotions are. The FCS can determine if you are happy, sad, angry, etc.. The ways it can tell is by your 44 major muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit."" Dr. Paul Eckman, a psychologist creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System).

F949490671FA,"Whenever we feel lost or lacking in information to make a decision we often find ourselves asking questions to help understand the topic, just like many of history's famous philosophers or scientists. Such as the famous Amelia Earhart who questioned her society and its many leaders and their sexist beliefs, and the prodigy Albert Einstein who questioned his colleagues and fellow scientists about their mathematics and science theories. Both were inspired by asking themselves a question and still tried to find a better and more refined answer to support their decision and came out on top, and becoming heroes in history. Therefore, seeking multiple opinions really can help someone make a better choice by processing both sides of a topic, and receiving more information.

Seeking multiple opinions gives us two sides or more, of each topic we question. One example would be if the earth is flat or spherical in shape. Although this topic hasn't been fully debated yet. We could fully understand why both sides are so defensive by asking about their opinions. Hearing what both sides have to say can also shed light onto smaller debates that could have a bigger impact on the whole entire issue. Unfortunately, asking for other's opinions can also have some downside effects. Such as false information or too much bias to uphold that statement. Nonetheless, asking for others opinions can still help us understand their side of the topic, and quite possibly what they know that we don't.

We can also obtain more information about a topic by seeking multiple opinions. Not only do scientists and philosophers gain from more information when seeking opinions, but even the mightiest and greatest leaders of history, such as Gandhi who questioned his country and learned of an imperialistic Britain that was corrupting their way of life. When we question many others about their opinions we are given insight into what we missed or had forgotten in the past. Although, when asking others we receive a lot of things that we don't understand yet, so we tend to look it up on the internet out of curiosity and the burning questions we have. Unfortunately, even the internet can't give us all the right answers to our questions, and this will often lead us in the wrong direction.

You'll realize that the one small topic that you may have chosen out of the infinite possibilities, has given you a large amount of answers. By asking one question you came up with hundreds more, and your knowledge on the topic may have been much better than when you first started by asking that one little question. Which proves that seeking others opinions really can help you make a better choice by giving you both sides of the topic, and receiving more information.            ",0,0.014005153,0,True

There are many reason why the principal shouldn't do this because many kids that's all they look forward to in school, they make get averment's with there sports, and they have great talents in there sport. Have you ever thought about it that way before?

first, many students think about getting out of school so they think about what they will do after, some students will text, watch tv,or what they would do a sport they love that makes them feel open and free and not have to worry about any of the small things that get to them like school,drama,and problems at home. i think ever students should be able to have the opportunely to be free and open in ever little thing they do wirthery they have a B average to.

AB6284069E18,"Some schools offer education at home, online, and or video conference calls. Teachers and some students believe that off campus is horrible. The reason why is : you won't have an actual human teaching you with online classes ,Video conference calls aren't great because most people aren't paying any attention to the teachers or student also you would need more assistance which is just unnecessary. Then finally you won't meet any people and you won't learn how to socialize at the end you won't learn how speak to people.

The school that offers these programs should just destroy these programs. Students should learn to how to go to school. Learn how to make friends,teachers,also day to day people. Just go get an education which is very important thing to do and that needs to happen if you want to do anything for the future the place they should just get an education is on a on campus school.

To the schools that offer the out of school education some that are at home,online,and video calls. Teachers and a lot of surveys show that having students with out of school education tend to have lower grades, more missing assignments,and less people in there lives. The facts just show that if you aren't at a on campus school,You're grades tend to be way lower then the average student on campus student. If you don't go to on campus schooling you will become social awkward. It's not fun staying home

With the online classes these days it has some benefits but the end of the day it's still a very bad distraction usual for example people love to watch television while doing work , but they aren't doing the assignment with 100 percent attention. If you want to get something done do it the right way. Also with the student they have many ways to cheat with any kind of education that's not on a on campus school cheating is 100 percent wrong not the right thing to do. Studies show that if you have two or more things that you are doing you are doing at the same time they aren't using there whole brain to do they're work. One of the major reason why online classes aren't good because you can just google the answers that's just cheating you aren't learning it's cheating.

Video Conference calls are just a waste of time. Students don't listen or even look at the screen to the call. It's just better and useful if you went to school. Just go to school you won't have to do calls and extra things like calling over and over again. Also it teaches you not to be lazy. If you go to school you wouldn't need to call or anything of the sort just go to school and get an education.

The school should destroy these programs and students need to go to an on campus school education or they won't be able to anything for the future for there education because they didn't pay attention or learn it well plus they won't have any friends to know them.

In conclusion students should be able to go to an on campus school just like the rest of us and meet new people and friends for the future.",0,0.0065124063,0,True
8BCC11CF4350,"Dear principal,

From these two polices given i am agreeing more on having no cell phones at school at all. kids that bring there phones are most likely to lose or get there phone stolen. Then that is making all the school administrators take there time to look for there phone, but if they have not brought it to school in the first place then that wouldn't have been a problem.

Bringing a phone to school could never be a great idea because they would end being broken, stole, or they just make people focus less if they have them with it.

When some one brings a phone they'll end up playing games during the middle of class when the teacher isn't watching. Then the person sitting beside him might want to play and end up making him miss some important information from the teacher. When this happens the student would might end up failing a quiz or test all because of the distraction of the phone.

Most of the time i see some person playing or texting on there phone. Which i find really distracting, and there's noting i can do to stop them unless move to another spot. Phones could also hold answers to a quiz or a test. That person can easily take there phone out when the teacher isn't looking and cheat. That's one of the big problems with phones people cheating.

Some people might say phones are helpful in school because of all the little helpful tools that are built into the phone. For example some one who needs a calculator wouldn't need to worry on bring or borrowing some one else's when they have one on there phone. A couple student might require there phone for when they get home to call there parents and tell them there all right. Or if something goes wrong in school or at home they could easily call for help right away.

Now that iv listened some of the resons why phones shouldn't be alowed at school is all up to you know. i still personally think having phones at school shouldn't be alowed. Due to all the distraction      ",0,0.0071872897,0,True

I'm going to just get straight to it; I don't think you should ban students with less than a C average from after school sports and activities. I feel quite strongly about this. My reasons are that, although I never participate in after school clubs and such, I am certain that they are very important to many of this schools C average students. For some students, I'm afraid to say, sports and activities are the only reason they have for coming to school anyways. If it weren't for sports, I believe they'd ditch school instead. Not to mention that a few who only manage a C, might just be unable to juggle school and sports... at least, not on their own. Perhaps, instead of cancelling sports for C students, they could be tutored, by teachers or fellow students. Encouraged to ask for help, instead of 'grounding' them for not. Its just in their nature not to want help. I know a few students who can't do without their after school fun and have no where to go after school hours but clubs. I know many of them, if they tried harder, could really blow us away. All we have to do is get them to try.

I believe that you shouldn't be able to text while driving because you are putting yourself and others at danger because you are no longer aware of your surroundings and can steer anywhere while you aren't paying attention. I understand that there are some things that need attention, but it's not worth the lives of innocent people. Nearly about 400,000 people die from texting and driving. 1 out of 4 car accidents occur from texting and driving and that's truly a shame. The average text sent takes the drivers eyes off the road for about 5 seconds and that's enough time to get into a life threatening accident according to SafeWise. com. These deaths hurt people mentally and physically and usually cause depression due to the fact that they lost a loved one to a foolish person. Some people don't even pay attention to the rules put in to place by the law and are seen constantly on the phone with someone.

These people deserve to get their license suspended and maybe even revoked because these people have no empathy for people who actually want to make it to their destination safely.

Technology that is able to, identify mixed emotions, scietificly proven and tested to work, and helps in school, Should be put in all schools.

First off, technology that can identify mixed emotions is a great tool in school and every ware. For exampel it could help stop peolpe in court rooms or when you are talking to a offeser. It can tell what persont of feelings you have. It said that the Mona Lisa ""... 83 percent happy, 9 percent, disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" (Pg.1)

This would help with identifying mixed emotions.

Secondly, It has been scientificly proven to work because Thomas Huang,and Nicu Sebe both from high colloges working on ways that humans and computers can communicate. They stared of with a ""cumputer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles.""(Pg 3) They created ""FACS"" this classifies six basic emotions. ""...happiness, surprise, anger disgust, fear, and sadness..."" (Pg. 3) These are all emotions that students have and that could us help from a computer that cares.

Lastly, it would help with school. Kids could see a problem on the computer and give a confused look at it and it could pop up a screan with a help page or it could inform the teacher that you are haveing truble. Nick D'Alto stated "" for example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" This would help at school so there could be less bad ad to pop up. This will help kids stay safe. If you have a problem and the computer could read your face it could modify that problem.

I have 3 reasons that I would like to share with you my reasons are that everyone would like to share differents ideas, Also working in group we can finish more early, and we can socialized with different people. Now I'm going to describe you why I choose this reasons. By sharing ideas I meant that everyone can have the opportunity to think and talk about that that person think. Because we don't have the same's idea's as other people thought. After all people in the group share their ideas we can writte in a piece of paper and see which one's are good and makes any sence, about the topic we are talking and we see which one's we can put on the class work we are going to do. Also about that we can finish more early, we can show it to the teacher on time and she can give as her opinion and ask her for some help about what part she think that we can add more especific words or meanings. Because sometimes we think that we have a good project but sometimes we have to figure out what part we can change and put differents things. And the last but not least that we socialized with other's this one is my favorite because in this one I can discribe a little bit of my self when I just came to this country from another I was so shy because no one came to talk to me in my second day of school. In my English class my teacher make a groups and some people start talking with me 2 person from that class help me in my english because it wasn't that good. I was so scare because first everyone was looking to me like I had something in my face and in this country everything is different to my country in this one we need some friends that help us when we need some help in english.

Them I introduce my self to everyone and I start making new friends. When we are new we think that no one is going to talk with us because we are from another country. Sometimes they don't talk with us because we don't speak the same lenguage as other. But we have to try our best to be friendly and make that the person doesn't feel shy we would like to that person feel happy in school and in each classes. Tha's why I think that is good to be working in group not alone. When we have homework or projects we like to have some help then doing by our self that is more hard, the projects are always so difficult or sometimes you don't understand what the teacher said because we are seatting on the back and some students are talking and we could't hear anything about what the teacher is talking about. But in a group they are 2 or more then 2 in the same group is good that one of that person of your group understand and explain to the people didn't get it. The internet is a big problem to alot of us some of us that we don't have internet or computer eather. I think that is a problem for me and one of the reasons that I like working in groups some family doesn't have enough money to put internet in home or buy a computer in home but also go to a public places that have internet and computer we have to pay. But working in group one of the students may have internet and go to that person home. I know that in our school we have computers in the library but on weekends is close the school or some of us we can't stay after school. Because we have to pick our littler brother or sister from other school. But the good thing is that one of us could have computer or internet in home and research some things about our work or project. Another thing that is good working in group is that when we are explaining a project in from in class we don't feel ready because we have to talk a lot or others reasons but in groups we can break parts and each one is going to talk about that part she or he loves more.

My Final opinion that I would like to share is that working is group is a good option then working by our self. Because not all of us have the opotunity to have internet, not all of us speak english some of us we need that someone speak our language for example sometimes I need someone that help me with some words in english that I don't understand because my first language is spanish and it's hard came to a country that don't speak your native language. And we can know new people to talk, not with the sameones because there is a lot of people that we don't talk and they are in the same classes of us we just want to be with the same ones and have to talk with everyone and help then when they need help.

951BF63BC21A,"The landform on Mars is quite interesting, and there could be many thoughts on how it came to be. With already known knowledge and knowledge that is soon to come, people like to guess. With the already known knowledge, we know so far that aliens have not been found on Mars yet, therefore they couldn't have possibly made a mark.

Like Earth, Mars is a planet just with different features. Our earth forms mountains and hills due to erosion and our plate tectonics. It's naturaly formed by the planet. No living organism created the rocky mountains. So with that, it is able to be assumed that Mars can form it's own hills and mountains as well.

Something else that is credible is that no life form has been found on Mars yet. Who knows if Mars has erosion or layers under it's surface that is able to move? On

Mars, there is no life that could have possibly created such a piece of art. Earth itself makes beautiful art like the Grand Canyon and

Niagra Falls. Naturaly, these landforms formed by Earth. Nobody knows exactly if Mars is able to do that, but with the relyablility we have today it has not proven that any life form could have created the Face on Mars.

If these markings were to be made by some kind of living organism, we almost certainly would know about it. Especialy with all of the high technology we have today, we would be able to see any kind of life. Maybe if we explored undernethe the surface of Mars, then we could get more information to see if Mars could have created it or if these aliens are living undernethe.

It's a great way to assume how it happened by comparing Mars to Earth, but it could also be irrelevent. Earth, unlike Mars, has an atmosphere. It keeps in heat, but changes. Earth also has water and life. If this were to be a cause of the rocks, hills, and mountains, then it could be said that the face on Mars was not created by erosion, water, or anything like that. It takes a lot of studing and even more knowledge to figure it out, but aliens don't seem to be logical quite yet.",0,0.0072705555,0,True
B0171B5E2D2F,"Dear Principal,

I strongly agree to your new ""B Average Policy"".

I feel that many students focus too greatly on sports and not enough on academics.

With the new policy i think a change will happen in test scores and the schools overall grade.

Though I'm sure many students will be writing to change your opinion on the policy, I recommend you stay with it.

Mrs. Principal, many students are determined that they can make it into the professional league with his/her' s sport, but frankly the chances are very slim.

I feel with the new policy it will at least motivate them to do better in the classroom before they go out on the field.

If the school's average could go from a C to a B then the school could earn all sorts of awards such as most improved and most motivated.

Not only would this give the school a better reputation, but it would also nominate us in the county and state to receive equipment, such as new computers, Smart Boards and new text books.

All of this would be caused by the new policy too.

The possibilities of what the ""B Average Policy"" will bring are limitless.

I strongly recommend that you stick with the policy, and continue to urge students to do better academically.

Thank you for your time.

CB440174C470,"Though the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is very interesting to read about, I do not believe it should be present in the classroom. There are a few issues I believe could be argued against using this software in a classroom setting. The FACS should be developed more and put through serious testing before being put in the classromm setting, but there were several other valuable uses for the program. The problems with the system in a school setting are the complexity of the system, the possible issue of privacy, and the accuracy of its predictions.

The FACS is a great idea that could have many applications other than schooling and several of these are included in this article, but it is currently too complex for school networks to handle. The author states outright in paragraph seven, ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."" The school computers that we use are even more out of date than the one I use at home and if it cannot run the system the school won't be able to without a major upgrade of technology or a major downgrade of the FACS, neither of which is desirable. The technology uprade needed for school computers would be too large of a bill to be practical in all but the richest of schools. The downgrade of the system to a simpler form will essentially defeat it's purpuse by killing its effectivity.

Another issue with the FACS in a school setting is privacy. How are we to be sure that they are not going to use our faces to gain access to things such as confiscated phones or to possibly find profiles online of students? Because this system requires a camera to see your face and put it through a detailed analysis, facial recognition security software like faceID on the Iphone X

then becomes a security concern. In paragraph six the author also mentions, ""If you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" This system in schools would essentially let the build a personal marketing profile on every student in the country.

The accuracy of the FACS would also have to be put through intense testing to determine how effective it actually is. Prof. Huang says,""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" If the system thinks that a student is confused when they actually aren't though, it could hurt their academic growth. It would be changing the material to a lower level in an attempt to interest them, but also at the same time lowering their understanding of the material.

In conclusion, I do not believe that this system would be as effective of a tool as it needs to be to offset the dangers it poses. The money needed for the complexity, the threats to privacy, and the questionable accuracy and adaptability of the system are too concerning to support the FACS as it now stands. If these concerns were addressed the possibly it could be an effective tool, but for the foreseeable future it is not.",0,0.033651136,0,True

AFF882607973,"Have you ever asked your friends for advice on an issue or to help solve a problem? If so, did you take that advice, or throw it to the wind without ever looking back? I believe that seeking multiple opinions allows for better decisions to be made. Asking for multiple opinions on a subject is efficient because it allows us to view an issue from multiple angles, allows for a more unbiased response, and hearing several opinions can change our thinking on a certain subject for the better.

First, asking for multiple opinions on a topic allows us to view an issue from all sides, rather than just our own. Hearing several sides of a story or particular topic, can often have an affect on our decisions. Say you and a friend get involved in an argument and you aren't sure how to handle it. You ask some friends what to do. They explain that your friend is having a bad day and some family issues at home. Rather than be upset with your friend, you decide to do everything in your power to help your friend out. Hearing other angles or sides of a story changes the way we view an issue or person, therefore plays a key role in the making of that decision or series of decisions.

Secondly, seeking advice from several people allows for a more unbiased response. For example, say a woman and her boyfriend have a disagreement. Asking her boyfriends best friend may not be such a great idea, seeing as he could be biased on the subject. Asking a group of neutral friends would prove most effective, therefore less biased. In more cases than none, one particular person may favor one side more than another, where as multiple people could appeal to both sides.

Lastly, receiving advice from several people can change our thinking on a topic for the better. An example would be, a friend of yours pulls a ruthless prank on you. Instead of laughing along with your friend, you become upset and infuriated. You make a split second decision to retaliate. Several people encourage you to inform your friend that their actions bothered you, rather than getting even. Hearing the same thing from several people can often affect the way we view a topic. Rather than repeating those infuriating actions towards your friend, you explain to that individual that you were offended and deeply upset by their prank. When we decide in our minds that something negative is a good idea, or our only option, hearing differently from multiple people with our best interest at heart becomes a deciding factor in the choices we make daily.

To sum it all up, asking multiple people for advice is more efficient that asking only one. Hearing several opinions allows for neutral, unbiased advice. Receiving advice from several friends, teachers, peers, or family members can play a rather important role on our thought process on a given topic in a positive way. And viewing all sides of a story, instead of just our own, can allow for better, more beneficial choices to be made.",0,0.029850395,0,True

To join the Seagoing cowboys you don't even have to be qualified, infact I didn't even know about it until my friend asked me if I wanted to come. My friend Don Reist invited my to travel to Europe on a cattle boat. So, really you don't need a big flashy degree or really anything at all to become a Seagoing Cowboy.

If you love animals you should become a Seagoing Cowboy. As a Seagoing Cowboy you get to spend a lot of time with a lot of animals. The day the Pacific war ended I set out on my first trip, which was to Greece with 335 horses, and if you like spending a lot of time with animals, it takes two weeks to cross the pacific, and to go to China it'll take a month. So, if you enjoy to spend time with animals you should join the Seagoing Cowboys.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy you get to have a lot of fun and do a lot of site-seeing. As a Seagoing Cowboy I always found a way to have fun. We would have baseball and volleyball games, we would have table-tennis tournaments, fencing, we would even enjoy boxing, reading, and even whittling. And to top it all off we saw a lot of amazing sites. We would go all over Europe and China. I have personally visited Greece, China, seen the Panama Canal, and have even toured an excavated castle in Crete. Even though there might be long excruciating trips, we still find ways to have fun.

52AAD6100DA5,"Nothing admits more absolute fear, than when you come in on the first day of school and the teachers asks for that important English project, which was due over the summer, that no one knew existed. You're not the only one. Many schools nowadays offer summer projects, which allow students to progressively learn the material for a classroom before going to school, preparing them for what's ahead and accelerating the first few weeks of school. But most of the time, these projects are made boring and often feel like an interference on our summer break. Quite frankly, anyone would prefer being with their friends rather than working on slide 22 of the AP Chemistry PowerPoint. So to put it forward, students, not teachers or anyone else, should be able to set the guidelines for these projects, so they can make it more creative and enjoyable, allow it to be more achievable, and to encourage more students to do their project due to the task being more receivable.

First off, it is consistently seen that creativity is dwindled by specific guidelines set by teachers on a project. Your project MUST have 20 slides or more, it MUST contain this or that. But as we see in the popular book/film series Harry Potter, particularly the first one, it is clearly shown that his aunt and uncle refuse to let him become a wizard. But as we know, he eventually goes to the ""Hogwarts"" and realizes the benefits of removing himself from the strict guidelines of his guardians, leading him to become much more invested in what he wants to become and happier overall. Allowing students to design these projects would allow for infinitely more opportunity. Rather than following the standard set pieces of paper or instructions, it would ultimately allow for students to push in their passions to these summer projects, encouraging them to do it and allows teachers to have insight on what how their students learn and express their knowledge. All in all, allow the students to take control and dispose of the original guidelines of class standards would allow for a creative boost from their fellow students, which would greatly boost the enjoyment for those doing the project.

To continue, many students have devoted their time to other important causes over the summer, such as: having a job, going on a vacation to see family, or working on their hobbies. Whatever it may be, it's clear that an intimidating summer project would very quickly begin to interfere with those experiences. In the film ""Coco,"" the main character (Milo) wishes to progress with his ability to play the guitar, but his families standard of shoe-making contradicts his own personal wants, and ultimately causes conflict with his family. This proves that if our school-life interferes with our passion and hobbies, there will be a certain amount of pain inflicted on those who have to put aside their own personal drives for some pathetic project. That is why it is essential for students to take charge of this project, because we are more aware that we don't waste our time doing random shenanigans and choose to make every moment count, ultimately leading the project to fit in when we can do it, and having specific standards that allow us to continue what we enjoy, and not fall flat to unfair due dates and standards.

Finally, we understand that teachers are much more experienced then we are. They have developed knowledge through years in college and have learned way more of life's lessons then we had. So why shouldn't they just keep doing the usual? Personally, I believe there is a certain bias against students due to this experience. To connect this: for my English class in 10th grade, I was required to write an essay which added on to a story I believed to be perfect as. There was no way out of the assignment and there was no way I could convince my teacher otherwise, and this one essay made my grade drop dramatically. But later that year, we were to act out scenes from the play ""Macbeth,"" yet the catch was we had to make it in our own guidelines and how to act it out. We were able to make this play, which is usually an assignment most people disgust, relate to ourselves and made it much more enjoyable. And that's the key right there: teachers may have experience, but they often unintentionally close off our connection to the material by creating unnecessary standards for said material. Students know their own peers, so it would only make sense for us to create the projects, so we can connect with our proper audience. In the end, teachers are not, in any way, bad at their jobs or have a ""boomer"" mindset based on their experience and knowledge. But there is an isolation of connectivity when receiving specific assignments, especially summer projects where all we have are instructions. So it's clear that students have the upper hand when it comes to connecting and involving other students into a more familiar and breathable environment

Now imagine you're back on that first day of school, except this time, it's not a soulless and effortless PowerPoint. This time, you and your friends got to get together and create an exciting and thrilling video about the summer assignment, and that excitement also shows your knowledge of the units for that class yet to come. This could be the potential of our summer projects, as students would be very willing to set the standards of summer projects; an exciting and encapsulating task for knowledge that benefits both the students and the teachers. This is just simply due to their spike in creativity, their understanding of making the guidelines realistically possible, and just making the project more reliable and having more likely to do the summer project.",0,0.008461562,0,True

The real question is, is the electoral college helping us or is it just bringing our government farther towards disaster? The electoral college should be diminished because it is an unfair direct election, and the disaster factor.

To begin, by keeping the electoral college we could avoid run off elections. This would help our governmental system because as noted by Richard A. Posner, ""There is pressure for runoff elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast."" By keeping the electoral college, we could help resolve runoff elections. What we dont know is if it will permanently work for our governmental system and is it worth the risk? The electors are the ones voting for the president, so we should question whether they should have control to help avoid these runoff elections. The writer notes, ""... the pressure would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by electoral college..."" Posner. Although that is true, that is only one problem that would be resolved by the electoral college, and one benefit is outnumbered by the numerous disadvantages to the electoral college.

Moreover, the disaster factor has a huge impact on the electoral collage. The writer states, ""The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century the system allows for much worse"" Plumer. This disaster was not the first disaster to happen in the system. According to Plumer, the system has had much more effect and damage on the United States and this should not be repeated again. The writer also says, ""electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please"" Plumer. This goes to show, not only is the electoral college unbeneficial, but they can be sneaky. The electoral college should be abolished because of the atrocious outcomes it is capable of doing to our government.

Not only is the electoral college capable of the disaster factor, but it also has no direct election. As stated in ""What Is the Electoral College?"", ""... when you vote for your candidate you are acually voting for your candidate's electors."" Office of the Federal Register. This means, voters have no control over whom controls the country. That is outrageous that the lives of these people will be affected by someone they did not want in the overpowering decisions of their country. Writer Plumer states, ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair too voters"" as well as ""The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational"" Plumer. Both of these point go to show that the electoral college is lowering our hopes for the government. The writer also notes, ""candidates don't spend time in states they have no chance in winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states"" Plumer. This proves that the electoral government thinks about their winning chances instead of our countries government.

96CBC15EF317,"Dear Principal,

I don't think you should make students do community service in they don't want to. Doing community service should be their choice. What they want to do on their own time should be their decision. They al ready go to school 7hours a day, let them do what they want when they get home. I am sure that kids wouldn't do as much homework if they had to do community service. Kids are al ready so busy, they have a social life, most teens have jobs, they have tons of school work to complete and a lot of kids are on sports teams. Adding one more thing would make them stressed and they might not get as good of grades or they might neglect something they have to do like homework.

If you are thinking of making them do it on school time then that would be a waste of time. I know that helping the community is important and all and I would diffidently encourage it in schools but, forcing them to do it is wrong there are more important things to do than community service. Getting good grades is definitely one of them, that is pretty mush the most important thing in your life as a teenager. Getting good grades pretty much decides the rest of your life because if you don't get good grades then you will not get into a very good college and you will probably not end up with a job you like.

Adding on more thing to their lives' is going to probably get into the way of school work and sports or other activities. Sports are important to for a kid. Sports helps you stay healthy and it can relive some stress. Look at most Americans a lot of them are fat. If kids don't get exercise then they will be unhealthy and probably develop bad eating habits. This community service thing is most likely going to get in the way of their exercise and sports which will lead to them being unhealthy and fat. So please don't force kids to do community service.

if there were less cars driving on the road then it could help alot of people.

4D1A2D62BDC4,"Today kids are nowhere near as social, productive, or getting as much exercise as they used too, but a principle has come up with a new plan to get kids involved again. By requiring students to involve themselves in a extracurricular activity that has many benefits in place for them.

Since the rise of gaming and social media many kids have scaled back on hanging out with their friends or going to social events like teen night, because they would rather sit at home on their phones or watch YouTube. I think it would be a huge improvement if kids had to do an extracurricular activity. Kids that do extracurricular activities could make new friends that have the same interests as them. Because what if there is a kid who is shy and really wants to play basketball but he has nobody to play with or feels he will have nobody to talk to but now the school starts having all the kids do an extracurricular activity and he joins the basketball club and make lots of new friends that he can now hang out with and play basketball with.

Therefore kids are not getting outside enough or being productive with their time if kids do at least one extracurricular is kids today with all these electronics are not being as productive as they should be. With an extracurricular activity kids could be outside because there could be a gardening club where kids could help plant flowers or tress and learn everything about how to keep a healthy garden they would also be out in the sun getting vitamin C which is great for the body where as a large number of kids sit inside and watch TV or play video games in a dark room with a bright screen flashing at them constantly which is not good for the brain nor the eyes

My next reason in why I support the idea is because kids today are not getting enough exercise as they should be instead they sit at home. If kids were required to do an extracurricular activity such as a running cub where they could track how much they run and for how long kids could track their exercise and then try to improve with more challening thing like maybe they run for longer or mabe they do the same workout on the track but after they go and run hills.

In conclusion I think kids should be required to do a least one extracurricular activity to help with social skills, increase productivity time, time outdoors or getting exercise. I believe this is a great opportunity for students to try new things and trying something even if it ends up not being you thing isn't going to hurt anything. ",0,0.0072108195,0,True
F81CE83F07A9,"As seen in paragraph 2 it says how venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size,but it also says that there were attempts to launch unmanned aircraft onto the planet and non of them lasted a few hours which is why there hasn't been an aircraft actually to land on venus. Paragraph 2 shows a little taste of how dangerous venus is but it is enticing to learn more about the planet itself. In paragraph 3 it explains how venus's atmosphere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide, and the clouds are highly corrosive with temperatures reaching more than 800 degrees Fahrenheit. These are even more reasons on why it is dangerous but yet you would wanna know more about it.

The reason why scientists wanna know more about the planet even though it is dangerous is because in paragraph 4 it says That ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" Which is another reason why scientists wanna know more about venus and what it has in store. The planet seems to be a very cool place to live without all the set backs with the atmosphere and the corrosive clouds. The scientists of NASA have an idea on how to send a manned vehicle to venus without getting into all the dangerous areas by putting a blimp like air vehicle hovering 30 miles above all of the bad and dangerous chemicals and heat.

The reason it would be a very good thing to study on is because of it being similar to earth in many ways.

There are many students that sit inside, and dont go outside as much as the are supposed to. I believe if our students are doing an extracirricular activity, it can be a great opportunity for them to make new friends and be more social. there are some students that struggle to find the courage to get up and find new friends, but if we have students doing sports, or as little as working on the yearbook once a week, it could have a big impact on those students social lives.

another good reason to have everyone do an extracirricular activity at school is it is very healthy for your mental and physical health. . All the exercise in fooball is physical, working your legs and arms to burn off fat and build muscle. But you can also improve your confidence and determination.

Finally we have extracirricular activities acting as a great outlet for kids who have family problems and/or are bullied. Most kids who have big problems dont like to open up about them because they feel like they'll be judged or made fun of, but if they are on an engaging sports team, or are working on the yearbook they could have someone to speak with that they trust, or just something to get their mind off of their personal problems.

I hope this helped you get another perspective on how extracirricular activities could help our school. it can get our students out of the house and be social, it is also very healthy for your mental health and physical health, and it can be a great outlet for kids who are having family problems or getting bullied.",0,0.006898302,0,True

No matter how hard they try and study about the Venus and learn how to land there safetly, its still going to be a dangrous. like every time u send some one there to study, the spacecraft cant land for a hours and they get in danger. The author kinda want people to just give it up. no matter what you do, Venus will be Venus. In the article it says ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"". Venus is a earth twin but u should never dream to go there. There is no spacecraft that survive landing in Venus. In the article it says ""No spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours"". The spacecraft cant survive it because the Venus is so hot. NASA is working on other approaches to studing Venus. They be sending people to Venus just to study Venus. They are trying harder and harder. They are now using some old technology called mechanical computers to study Venus. The mechanical computers were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War ll. NASA wont give up on studying Venus. People didnt know what Venus is before. Back then, Venus was coverd by tree and and mountains just like the earth. Now you can see it at the night time. Venus is called the "" Evening Star,"". It is one of the brightest light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot. The Venus is the dangrous planet that u should never go. No spacecraft servived the landing for more than a few hours. NASA is working very hard to study about the Venus and maybe wanna map everything on it.

DF76BBCD85B1,"There is an argument going around on whether summer projects should be designed by students or teachers.

The summer projects should be designed by the teachers because students won't challenge themselves in the summer, teachers know what criteria the students should learn, and it is the teachers job to give the students work.

The topic on this discussion is very interesting, but we all know that its would be most beneficial for the teachers to design the summer project.

To start off; if students designed their own summer project they would make it easy.

Most students can't wait for the last day of school so they don't have to do any work or should I say ""learn"".

Also if they do a summer project it should help preview what they are going to be learning in the upcoming school year, so if they don't know exactly what it is that they will be learning why should they have to design their own project which most would not what to do in the first place.

In addition to the students designing their own project there are a lot of potential problems that could occur.

Like they forget to inform everyone else on what the project is.

The students just are not mature or responsible enough to be able to design such a hefty task like a summer project all on their own.

Secondly on why teacher should deign the summer projects, is the fact that they know what they will teacher in the following school year.

The students should begin to get informed or a little bit of knowledge on what they will be taught in the upcoming school year.

The teachers that design the summer project should make it about topics that they will later teach the students on.

For example, if there is a lesson on the cells in a plant for next year, maybe have the students create a plant cell out of recycled materials.

Just little things so they come into the classroom ready and already with some knowledge on what will be presented in the school year.

Lastly on why teachers should design the summer project is that its the teachers job to design such things.

A student should not have to worry about what they are going to do for a project.

That is too much pressure on the youth.

Instead maybe teachers collectively as a group come up with multiple project ideas for the students.

Give the students multiple options on what assignment or project they would want to do.

The teacher are getting paid to teach and come up with lesson plans.

Therefore it should not be the students task to come up with any projects specifically one like a summer project.

On the other hand, if students design their own projects that could help them mature.

Although it may just apply pressure and stress on the students which is what we don't want happening to them.

We shouldn't make kids design their own projects especially if most don't want to do it.

Teachers should be the ones designing the projects due to the fact that they get paid to create such things as projects and know what lessons are going to be taught in the following year, and students just aren't ready for this type of task.

The answer is rather clear that is should be the teachers designing the projects and not the students.",0,0.0073049036,0,True
592F8F39E3EA,"Voting has always been something special for almost everyone. From African Americans fighting in the Civil War for the right to vote and women in the nineteenth-century also fighting for voting rights, Voting had always been a controversial topic. This privilege has changed many times in the beginning of the United States and since its birth, the primary way to vote for the president is the Electoral College. The Electoral college is a process of electors in it voting for the president. It is almost always an one-sided battle for whoever that agrees or disagrees with the Electoral Colloge. For someone that is usually neutral, i am in favor of keeping the Electoral College as the United States choose their president.

To begin with, even though the Electoral College is critisized of it not being democratic, it still allows the peoples' voices to be heard and expessed. The trust between the people and their electors is rarely betrayed, however it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. The Electoral College will  almost always gurantee an outcome while if it was another way, more ties and balancing will happen. from the article itself, it stated ""Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state.""- Richard A. Posner. The Electoral College will always let the people's voices be heard even if it was in a indirect way.

Furthermore, The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No single region in the United States ave enough electoral votes for a president to get elected. Regional favorites, such as Romney in the south, will have plenty of problems if he is just a regional favorite instead of all over the country. This system will caused presidents to be more diversed in the country to be able to spread hierachical diffusion of the idea of geting themselves to be elected. From source number three, it also states that ""a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president.""- Richard A. Posner. The people will get to experience the president themselves instead of jst voting for the one they are biased upon.

Lastly, The Electoral College method of selecting the president avoids the problem of elections in which no candidates recieves a majority of the votes cast and also dissovles the problem of few potential voters not wanting to vote. There is a pressure in which if no candidates win a majority of the vote,there will be a run-off election. that would greatly complicate the presidential election process by wasting more time and money. however, that process is reduced by the Electoral College method, which invariably produces a clear winner. The Electoral College System can also be argued against that it can turn off potential voters for a candidate who had no hope of carrying thier state. ""Knowing their vote will have no effect, there will be less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote.""- Richard A. Posner is one of the quotes in source number three. But of course, no single vote can change the outcome of a presidential election since voters in presidential elections are mpstly people who want to express an opinion than thinking that a single vote will change a election.

In conclusion, our current way of the Electoral College system is the best way to vote for presidential elections. Even though people could argue that it is un-democratic, the way they elect the electors and having the president promote themselves in a certain way does make the system every one bit of it democratic. To remind you senator, the Electoral Collage system should stay because it still allows the peoples' voices to be heard and expessed, requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, and it avoids the problem of elections in which no candidates recieves a majority of the votes cast and also dissovles the problem of few potential voters not wanting to vote. That is why i truly believe that the Electoral Collage is here to stay.    ",0,0.007990968,0,True
A76BA2CA628E,"If you've ever had a tough question then you would know there not easily solved. Most people go to others for advice, but is having advice from one person really enough to make the right choice?

There are so many reasons why it is better to ask more than one person for advice. One reason is because, gives you multiple viewpoints. There are so many different ways to look at things. People always say look at it from someone else's point of view or a different point of view, which is why it's helpful to do this when asking for advice. One of the best ways to look at a question is from a different point of view than your current one. Probably the best way to do that is to ask different people on their view of the question or topic.

Another reason it's good to ask multiple people for advice, is it gives you multiple answers. Let's say you have to decide between having cupcakes or cookies at a gathering, your going to want to get what everyone is going to want. While getting one persons advice is great, there's going to be ore than one person there, and they should all have a say in what is being served. However if you only asked one person and not the others, many people might not like the choice. You defiantly want to make the right choice and make sure everyone is happy.

The last reason is because, one person you ask might have more experience than the first person you asked. For example people who are older usually are wiser because they've gone through lots of things, and have most likely have received advice from others and given advice. So say you were asking a friend for advice when your trying to decide, but they don't know what to do because they've never had that question. So do you take their advice or ask someone else? It would always be better to go to someone that has had that question rather than taking advice from that friend, just because you make sure yo make the right choice.

For multiple viewpoints, lots of different advice, and for people with different experience levels, there are many different reasons to ask multiple people for advice. So next time you ask for advice remember more advice or opinions is better than less.   ",0,0.008217878,0,True
B0D9116BE51A,"Schools want students to continue their education over summer break with projects the student body want to the design. Should they be allowed to? Although teachers would make the project more educational ad school related, the students should be allowed to make the projects. The teachers would make the project more educational, but it's the students summer break. Summer is a time of fun in the sun and for the students to express creativity, and teachers shouldn't take that away.

First, it's summer break, three months away from school and teachers. The students should be allowed to come up with a way to combine summer and school. All year the teachers drone on and give homework and projects the student had no say in, so its the student's turn to show their creativity and make a project all their own. Giving students this freedom would make the project less boring and painful. It would also inspire them to actually do it instead or them just not caring about it. They get to make something their own. They can do whatever they please with the project. They can make those three months of freedom worth while with a fun project.

Additionally, the teachers would make the project more school related and for a class they will never take again. The student could make the project about the next class they are taking based on research they found from the local library or online. They could visit their dream college and do a report on that. Something the student genuinely cares about. Students don't want to do projects or care about school over summer. They can compromise with the teacher about the project and make it. It can be a big responsibility test, but a fun one. The teacher should trust the students to make fresh and fun ideas on their own instead of forcing another boring school project.

Finally, the projects from teachers requires a single trip to a store and staying inside all summer. They did that enough in school, now is the time for the students to show the teachers what they can do and what they can come up with on their own. The students should be able to go outside and see what they can do with the things they find in nature. They could make a fun, outdoor adventure instead of a boring essay or poster board with little to no creativity or color. Teachers would get more out of the teacher for creativity and personality than something they threw together last minute. As students get older, they want more freedom and rights. They want to be equals with their teachers. Teachers always say they want students to show creativity, so let them.

In conclusion, the students need to pick their projects. For creativity, freedom, and responsibility. Teachers should let their students have creative control over the project. The students should be allowed to do whatever they please over break. It's summer, they should have some fun with it. ",0,0.007251421,0,True

When students find themsleves away from school due to personal issues, then it becomes essential to find other ways to aquire knowledge. Often times, people assume the only way to learn is to be in a classroom, but students can benefit from online classes. Online classes benefit students because they can convienently make up work, work from a comfortable environment, and feel less stressed about the work load.

Online classes benefit students because they can convienently make up work. There are many resons why students may miss a class. They could be sick or have a family emergency. Maybe a loved one just died. Regardless of the reasons, there must be a way to easily gain the same amount of wisdom as if they were really in class. If the work is all online, then the students can do the work as they wish. The online work makes missing school easier to make up. If a student should miss time, then he can easily do the work online. In addition, online work can also benefit because students can choose where they work.

Online classes benefit students because they can work from a comfortable environment. Sometimes school can get a litle crazy. Students may just need to find an environment where they feel safe and are comfortable. Students are more productive when they are in a place of comfort. Working online grants the students the ability to choose where they acomplish their tasks. Students feel like they can achieve greater things in a comfortable place.

Online work can also help releive some of the stress that comes with all the assignments.

Online classes benefit students because they can feel less stressed about the work load. Students get increased anxiety when they miss school becuase of all the work they have to make up. They feel pressured and can easily fall behind. Because of online work, the students can make up their work and feel less stressed because the work is in an easy plae to complete. There is no need to come back to school and feel behind. Online work gives students the opportunity to get ahead of their missing work.

With out online work, students would fall behind in class. There will always be times where the student has no other choice but to miss school. With a place to work online, students won't feel the pressure or stress that comes along with worry.

3C11CE4316CA,"Dear state senator, to the people voting is the most important part of politics. You out of all people speak politics, so you should understand. Keeping the electoral college would be many more great successful years in voting because of the certainty of outcome, it would take care of the swing and big states, and it avoids run-off elections.

Disputes over the outcomes of an electoral vote is possible. The winning candidate's share of the electoral college exceeds the popular vote. In other words in 2012 Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the votes while Romney recieved only 51.3, and because almost all of the states award winner-takes-all even a slight chance of popularity could change the results. It is very unlikely for this to happen. Although there are many things wrong with the electoral college like making peoples votes not exactly count, it is something to figure out.

For the swing and big states, the voting is slightly different. The voters in the toss-up states tend to pay more attention to the campaign than any other place. They really get into the whole campaign and really listen to all of what the competing candidates say and do. For the big states, the electoral college does them a favor and gives them more electoral candidates. It restores the weight in the balance that large states lose by virtue.

The electoral college does us a big favor by avoiding run-off situations, that could lead tomore complicated situations. The run-off election occurs when no candidate recieves a majority of the votes casted. These run-off elections cause a lot of pressure, and surely does complicate the presidential election.

In conclusion, staying with the electoral college process, it would maintain our problems of eun-off elections, certainty of the outcome and the big and swing issues.                                    ",0,0.006689941,0,True

Technology has made a big impact on the world today. The number problem with technology is CELL PHONES! We use cell phones all day and night. There have been so many accidents and mostly the cost of texting and driving. I think that drivers should not be able to use their phones while driving but only if emergency & navigation. This will lead to lower accidents in the u. s.

We all want to be on are phones every minute and every second but here are some facts that will make you think twice before picking up the phone. Approximately 600,000 drivers are attempting to use their phones while behind the wheel of an automobile. There are nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents while texting and driving. The reason its it so high because people are convinced that texting and driving isn't dangerous, we need us humans to realize that lives matter so we need to reflect on risks.

On the day of July 1, 2018 a new law saying that "" Drivers cannot have a phone in their HAND or touching any part of their body while talking on their phone while driving"". Meaning you will get a ticket and i'm pretty sure that nobody wants to get a 150-250 dollar ticket for doing something stupid. It's really sad when you think about it, people have developed skills and strategies to make it look like they're not on the phone.

People often feel like they will miss something and separated from the world when they aren't on their phone. So many many lives have been taken just because a single text or a single call.

""The founding fathers established it in the constiitution as a compromise between election of President by a vote in Congress and by popular vote of qualified citizens.(infor. find in paragraph 1)"", but in my opinoin i think that we should change the election by the popular votes. By doing that, it allows voters to have a fair vote. There would not a ""winner-take-all"" system anymore, but above all the candidates can have a fair fight against each other without the interfrence of the representatives.

Well to start it off, why would having the popular vote be better than the electoral college? That's because the electoral college is unfair to voters. ""The winner-take-all system in each state caused the candidates to not spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states.(infor find on paragraph 13)""

Perhaps you are wondering, what does the reprentatives got anything to do with electoral college being unfair to the candidates. When there are two candidates who are tie in the electoral vote, the decision whould be thrown to the representative to decised. ""The single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, and the 55 representatives from california represent 35 million voters.(infor find on  paragraph 12)"" By given that many votes for just one representative, is it fair for the candidates? Not only that, but what about the 55 representative from california, what if all those 55 representative voted for their candidate from california? You know without thinking, of course the candidate from california would win. Would it be fair for the candidates and the other voters?

Although if you think about it, electoral vote can help in cerent ways. Like what if there is not many voters that voted? Or being in a tie, but of course that wouldn't happens, and like i said earlier it would'nt be fair to some of the candidates and voters who tried hard to elect or be elected.

Would you ever drive the length of a football field at 55 mph blindfolded? Well that's essentially what you're doing when texting while driving.

007E0CBA8852,"In life all of us suffer many trials and obstacles of different extremes. As humans a normal way to deal with these trials is to look to someone for comfort and advice. Whether that may be many people or just one person it is usually someone we confide in with our thoughts and someone that can confide in us to be able to tell the truth. At times, we may find it better to talk to more than one person when asking for advice. We may go to one person to get an outside opinion on the situation. By getting this outside opinion this person may not necessarily be biased to one side of the story and it gives this person a chance to be truthful. You may also go to someone who has a different way of thinking as you, someone with a different mindset. This person could bring up new points to you and new sides of the situation to open up your mind to new possibilities. There might also be someone who has a similar way of thinking as you that could help you reassure and understand your thoughts and emotions. Another reason why you may go to a different person is just to vent. By simply telling this person everything thats going on it could help you organize thoughts in your own head. You may not look for this person for advice but someone to be there to listen to you while you figure out how you want to move forward in the situation. By expressing your feelings to this one person it could help you organize and address thoughts in your own head. By asking for advice from multiple people it could help you explore different mindsets, get an outside unbiased opinion, and give you a chance to express and organize your thoughts and emotions.

At times in stressful situations or in situations where you simply need advice it may be better to talk to a distant friend or an adult who isn't exactly in the loop of things that are happening in your life. Talking to someone to get an outside opinion could help because this person doesn't know all parts of the story or maybe doesn't know everybody involved personally. This is helpful because they have no sense of bias on who is involved and what is happening in the situation. This person isn't going to sugar coat their words and tell you the truth even if it's something that you don't want to hear. They may simply listen to what you have to say and will already be ready to introduce to you new opinions and will help you look at it from a different perspective. They may tell us the truth to address the things we may be avoiding in the situation such as something that is right or wrong. This helps us because sometimes we need to hear the truth to see why we are right or wrong in these situations. By hearing the truth and possibly getting advice to move forward you get to move forward with all your facts laid out.

Another type of person that you may seek for advice is someone who you know has a different mindset than you and maybe even someone who has a similar mindset than you. By talking to someone who has an opposing mindset as yours they will be able to give you new perspectives and new ways at looking at the situation. It may not always be a positive mindset but it's good to look at the negatives just as much as the positives. This persons different way of thinking and looking at things may introduce new and different ideas on how you should move forward and how you should address the situation. You may also seek someone who has a similar way of thinking as you. Theres always a possibility of this person help you discover new thoughts and information but this person will also assure you about the thoughts youre already having and make you feel better about them. They will give you this sense of reassurance it will help you move forward confidently and effectively.

The last type of person you may seek for advice is someone who is a good listener. This person will listen to everything you have to say and will just let you vent all your emotions and that may be the only advice they give you to just vent. This person will not only listen but support you on your choices and on what you have to say no matter what. By venting to this person it could help you organize your thoughts by simply expressing them all out loud. It is likely that it may even help you come to realizations you hadn't come to before. This person is very important when going through this stressful process of not knowing what to do of getting that reassurance that everybody needs from time to time. This person may or may not be the best person for advice but they are really good of being there when you need them and listening to you when you are going through a stressful. By expressing and addressing these thoughts it could help you move forward content with your thoughts and confident on your decisions.

In conclusion, I think that by seeking more than one person for advice it helps you get the support you need to make new and smart choices. Different people that are helpful to seek advice from is someone who is more of an outside opinion because they tell you the truth and dont sugar coat their thoughts. If you seek someone who has a different mindset they will introduce new ways of thinking and different approaches you could take in the situation.

By expressing all your feelings, thoughts, and emotions you are letting someone know how you feel and getting the support you need to move forward confidently. By talking to multiple people exploring new thoughts and mindsets, getting an unbiased opinion, and being able to express and organize your thoughts you are getting set up to make good choices rationally. I personally believe that when someone asks multiple people for advice it and seeking multiple opinions it helps them be able to make smart and rational choices while being confident with their choice and content with their thoughts and emotions.                                                           ",0,0.0073462618,0,True

So all of this begins when a computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 of the major muscles in your face. In the model all these muscles move like a actual humans. Dr. Paul Echman ,creator of the FACS, classified the face having 6 basic emotions- happiness ,surprise, anger,disgust, fear, and sadness. Each thing is accosciated with its own characteristic movement. Each and every single person has the same universal emotions on there face, they are all universal. Dr. Huang said that "" even tho individuals often show varying degrees of expression."" The real question is tho is how this can help us when it comes to school and teachings in the classroom. What I mean by this is that teachers could know when the students are not finding interest in a subject of a disscussion anymore. This technology can scan the room and see what peoples emotions are during the subject and if they are not good then the teacher could try a different approach and if that worked then they would know that is what they need to try for the next class. Everyone learns a certain way and if you have a class that has a majority of people that learn a certain way then you know the sense of direction you need to teach based on this technology.

Now that we know that everyones emotions come off the same way and that everyones reactions to things are relativly close, don't you think that this would be good in a learning enviroment? Every person learns a certain way and if you know this then why dont we use this technology in classes so the teachers know that they need to change up teaching styles or just come back to something a different way.",0,0.0071246903,0,True

Skeptics did not realise that NASA would benifit monumentaly from the discovery of an ancient alien monument on the surface of mars. In 2001 the Mars Global Surveyor again was close enough to catch a pitcure of the Face on Mars, the picture spanned a total of 1.56 meters compared to the Viking's 43 meters per pixel photo, The Surveyors photo revealed simply a landform similar to that of a mesa of butte.

180159E53733,"Do I think online classes would benefit students from being able to attend classes from home? Yes! I think it would actually be better for people 18. If you are 18 it gives you more free time to get a full time good paying job and you will still be able to go to school. It is not as hard on your body as going to school either, saying that meaning when you work and you go to school most days you would have to leave school and go straight to work. With online classes you can wake up for class do your work an when you finish you can go back to sleep until its time for you to go to work. Believe it or not you have more time to do your class work to, you can do it before you go to work or as soon it is given to you. You just have to know how to manage your time right and wanna do good in school and maintain a steady job.

Taking online classes really gives you a lot of free time you just have to know what to do with it. If it was me who had a chance to take only online classes. I would get me a full time job some where and I would do both. when I say that I know it sounds stressful and hard to do but when you really put thought into it you would have time to do them both. Say if I was working over night I could wake up around Noon I could do my work and then I could go back to sleep and rest more before I go to work. I could really picture that working out.

If someone is to try this with online classes it world be easier on their body because, you dont have to wake up and go to school and stay up all day and then go to work you can rest a little more before you go to work. Then you are not gonna be tired at work you can come home and sleep and then you dont have to wake up early after you get off of work late. You may not know it but rest is a big thing I never understood that until I got a job an now that I am not getting that much sleep I realized that your body needs rest because without rest your body is not right until you get the rest you need.

The good part about the whole thing is that you will have a lot more time to do your classwork. I am not talking about a hour of class time im talking about you can sit down and finish all of your work at your own pace you will get much more done in less time and you will still have more free time. you will still be able to enjoy yourself on your days off with no school work or if you have some you have not done you can do it on your days you have off. Honestly its a lot of ways you can go about having online classes a lot of people can have a lot of different ways to look at this but this is just the way I look at it. If i was to ever get the chance to do online classes I would take this route and try to maintain a job and school at the same time i am not really sure why this is just how I would go about it.

In conclusion if you are in high school an they offer online classes for people almost done with school take them up on that because it would push you harder to graduate letting you know that your almost there. some people might thing school is easier but everyone opinion is different. My opinion would be what i talked about in my paper which is to take the online classes an get you a job so therefore you could work and make money while you not in school. And if thats not what you want to do just fine something out in the world productive to do for the time you are taking those online classes. I am almost sure if your 18 and you are taking online classes or is almost finish high school you can probably take collage courses for the time being just to get a head start on your life after high school.",0,0.007083381,0,True
6d23fb43,"Limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can greatly benefit society. By reducing our dependence on cars, we can tackle issues such as greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, improve public health, and create more sustainable and accessible communities.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the positive impact it has on the environment. According to the passage set, passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions. By reducing the number of cars on the road, especially in car-intensive areas, we can significantly decrease these emissions. For instance, the German suburb of Vauban has successfully implemented a car-free community where 70% of families do not own cars. This has resulted in cleaner air and less pollution for residents. Similarly, during a partial driving ban in Paris to combat smog, congestion decreased by 60% and pollution levels dropped. These examples show that limiting car usage can have a direct positive impact on the environment.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement of public health. The passage set highlights that car emissions contribute to poor air quality, leading to smog and respiratory issues. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can improve air quality and decrease health problems associated with pollution. In Bogota, Colombia, a car-free day was introduced to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Millions of Colombians participated by hiking, biking, or taking public transportation to work. This event showcased the potential for car-free initiatives to improve public health by reducing pollution levels and creating clean and breathable environments.

Moreover, limiting car usage can lead to the development of more sustainable and accessible communities. The passage set mentions the concept of ""smart planning"" and creating compact suburbs that are designed to be less dependent on cars. This includes placing stores within walking distance, improving public transportation options, and reducing the amount of parking space. By implementing these changes, communities can become more walkable, reduce the need for car usage, and promote a healthier and more active lifestyle. Vauban, Germany, is an example of a community that has adopted these principles and created a car-free environment. This has resulted in residents feeling happier and less stressed, as mentioned by a media trainer and mother of two in the passage.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can benefit society as a whole. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can decrease greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and promote public health. Additionally, creating communities that are less dependent on cars can lead to increased sustainability and accessibility.

A495DAE52B0E,"Group Work vs. Solo Work: Which is Better for School Success?

As an 8th grader, I have experienced both group work and solo work in school, and I have to say, there are pros and cons to each. While some people might argue that working alone is the best way to get things done, I believe that group work has its advantages.

One of the biggest benefits of group work is that it allows for better collaboration with friends. When we work together, we can bounce ideas off each other and come up with better solutions to problems. For example, in our math class, we recently had a project where we had to solve a complex problem. By working in groups, we were able to divide the workload and come up with a solution that was better than anything any of us could have done alone. Plus, it was fun to work with my friends and brainstorm together!

Another advantage of group work is that it helps us develop our independent and social skills. When we work alone, we can get into a routine of just doing our own work and not really interacting with others. But when we work in groups, we have to communicate and work together to reach a common goal. This helps us learn how to compromise, listen to others, and take turns. These are important skills that will help us in the future, whether we're working in a team at a job or just trying to get along with our friends and family.

However, there are also some disadvantages to group work. For one thing, it can be hard to get everyone on the same page and working towards the same goal. Sometimes, people don't pull their weight and the project doesn't turn out as well as it could have. And if we're working on a project that we're not really interested in, it can be hard to stay motivated and engaged.

On the other hand, working alone has its own set of benefits. When we work alone, we can focus on our work without any distractions or interruptions. We can take our time and make sure that everything is perfect before turning it in. Plus, we don't have to worry about anyone else's opinions or ideas – we can just do our own thing.

But there are also some downsides to working alone. For one thing, it can be really boring",1,0.9944348,1,True

Dear Principal [Principal's Name],

I am writing this letter in response to the consideration of changing our school's cell phone policy. After careful consideration of both policies proposed, I believe that Policy 1 is the better option for our school.

Firstly, allowing students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times can help students stay connected with their families. This is especially important in case of emergencies or unexpected situations. If a family member needs to contact us urgently, we could be reached immediately. Moreover, if we have an early or a late dismissal from school, our parents would know about this and can plan accordingly to pick us up.

Secondly, Policy 1 also teaches us the importance of self-discipline and responsibility. It allows us to learn how to handle distractions and prioritize our tasks during school hours. If we are given the privilege to use our phones during lunch and break times, it is up to us to decide how we use that time wisely. This is a valuable skill that we can develop, which will serve us well in our future lives beyond school.

Lastly, having the option of using our phones during break times can be used as an incentive for our academic performance. For instance, if a student maintains a good GPA or has good attendance, they could be given the privilege of using their phones during class for educational purposes.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that Policy 1 would be a good fit for our school. It will help us stay connected with our families, learn important life skills, and also serve as an incentive for our academic performance. Thank you for considering my opinion in this matter.

Zoos provide a safe haven for endangered species, where they can live and breed without fear of habitat destruction or poaching. In the wild, these animals may not survive due to various threats, but in captivity, they have a better chance of survival.

Zoos also serve as a platform for educating people about different species of animals and their importance in our ecosystem. They offer educational programs and tours that help visitors understand the behavior, habitat, and needs of various animals. This knowledge helps create awareness and encourages people to take action towards protecting these species and their habitats.

Moreover, many zoos conduct research on animal behavior, physiology, and genetics. This research contributes to our understanding of these animals and helps us develop better strategies for their conservation. For example, the research conducted on giant pandas in captivity led to the development of successful breeding programs, which have increased the population of this endangered species.

While there are some concerns about the welfare of animals in zoos, most modern zoos prioritize the well-being of their animals. They provide them with large enclosures, nutritious food, and medical care when needed. Additionally, many zoos participate in breeding programs aimed at reintroducing endangered species into the wild.

In conclusion, zoos play a crucial role in conservation and education. They provide a safe haven for endangered species, educate people about the importance of wildlife conservation, and contribute to research that helps protect these species. While improvements can always bemade to ensure the best care for animals in zoos, I believe that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks, and zoos should continue to operate.",1,0.994505,1,True

Hey, y'all! Today we're gonna talk about how technology has made our lives way easier. Like, think about it - we used to have to walk to the library to do research, but now we can just Google it and get the answers in like, two seconds. It's crazy!

First of all, technology has made communication so much easier. We can Facetime our friends and family who live far away, and it's like they're right there with us. We can also send them messages and pictures through social media, which is way faster than sending a letter in the mail. And with video games, we can play with our friends online and hang out with them even if we're not in the same room. It's like, the best thing ever!

Another way technology has made our lives easier is by helping us learn stuff. There are so many cool websites and apps that can teach us anything we want to know, from math to history to how to play the guitar. And with online courses, we can even take classes from teachers all around the world! It's like, we're not limited to learning just what's in our textbooks anymore.

Not only does this broaden our horizons, but it also offers a chance to learn about different cultures and lifestyles.

In addition to spending time with family and exploring the world, outdoor activities also provide a chance to take a break from electronic devices. In today's world, it's easy to become consumed by technology and spend all of our time staring at screens. However, spending time outdoors provides a chance to disconnect from technology and enjoy the beauty of nature.

Drama classes can also offer invaluable opportunities to practice interpersonal communication skills such as public speaking, as well as giving students an opportunity to build confidence and find their own creative voice. 

However, it is also important to touch upon the potential drawbacks to taking music, drama, and arts classes. For instance, these activities can be time-consuming and can take away from time that students could have spent on schoolwork. Furthermore, there is often an intimidating element that comes with these types of performances; having an audience can be difficult for some students, especially those who are more introverted. 

Importantly, parental support plays a critical role in the success of taking these activities. Without encouragement from their parents to try new things and promote confidence, students may not have the confidence to try out these activities or feel comfortable enough to do so. Encouragement from parents can make the whole experience less stressful and more enjoyable overall. Examples of this could include providing support when students are preparing for an upcoming performance or class.

Like, they don't just do the bare minimum, they go above and beyond. They want to be the best, like a castle. Get it? Like, a castle is the best building in the kingdom, right?

So, let me give you an example of someone who's really good at striving for excellence. My sister, for instance. She's always trying to get straight A's in school, even though she already gets good grades. She doesn't settle for anything less than the best. She studies really hard and asks for extra help when she needs it. That's determination, man.

Determination is like, when you really want something and you're not gonna stop until you get it. Like, my friend Jake wants to be a professional basketball player. He practices every day, even on weekends, and he's always watching videos of pro players to learn new moves. He's determined to make it to the NBA, and I know he will if he keeps at it.

Hey there! Have you heard about the Face on Mars? Some people believe it was created by aliens. But let me tell you, that's just not true! The Face is actually a natural landform, and I'm here to tell you why.

Body:
First of all, the Face is just a hill on Mars that looks like a face because of the shadows. As the article says, ""The Face on Mars, located in the Cydonia region, is a flat-topped hill with two distinctive features that give it the appearance of eyes."" The article also says that the Face is made up of ""two symmetrical lobes"" that look like eyes because of the shadows. But just because something looks like a face doesn't mean it was created by aliens!

Secondly, scientists have studied the Face for years, and they've found that it's completely natural. The article says that ""the Face on Mars is thought to have been formed by a combination of geological processes, including erosion, deposition, and plate tectonics."" That means that the Face was created by natural forces, not aliens!

Lastly, the article also says that the Face is not even a unique landform. There are similar landforms on Earth and even on other planets! For example, ""the Face on Mars bears a striking resemblance to the Mesozoic era dinosaur, the Triceratops."" That means that the Face is just a normal part of how planets form, and it's not some strange alien creation.

Conclusion:
So there you have it! The Face on Mars is just a natural landform, not some alien creation. It's important to remember that just because something looks interesting or unusual, it doesn't mean it was created by aliens. Scientists have studied the Face for years, and they've found that it's completely natural. So next time someone tells you that the Face on Mars was created by aliens, you can tell them the truth – it's just a normal part of our solar system!",1,0.48920467,0,False

As an 8th grader, I've noticed that many of my classmates struggle with weight-related issues, and it's affecting their overall well-being. In this essay, I'll explore the effects of obesity, the importance of healthy food options in school lunches, and how different cultures view food. I'll also examine the consequences of unhealthy food choices and the financial implications of switching to healthier school lunch options.

Firstly, obesity is a serious health problem that can lead to various health issues such as diabetes, heart disease, and respiratory problems. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), childhood obesity has more than tripled since the 1970s, and it's now affecting about one in five school-age children in the United States. This is a concerning trend, as obesity can have long-term effects on a person's quality of life and increase the risk of developing chronic diseases.

Secondly, healthy food options in school lunches are crucial for the well-being of students. A balanced diet provides the necessary nutrients and energy for learning and physical activity. However, many school lunches often consist of processed foods high in sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats. This can lead to a range of health problems, including obesity, digestive issues, and malnutrition. By providing healthy food options, schools can help promote a culture of healthy eating habits and reduce the risk of obesity among students.

Thirdly, different cultures view food in unique ways. Food is not just a source of sustenance, but it's also a reflection of cultural identity and tradition. For example, in many Asian cultures, food is a symbol of hospitality and community, while in some African cultures, food is a way to show respect and gratitude.

In today's fast-paced world, it is easy to become overwhelmed by work, school, and other responsibilities, leading to a lack of time for rest and relaxation. However, research has shown that regular inactive times can have numerous benefits, including a longer life, fresh ideas, and more energy.

One real-life example of the danger of not having regular inactive times is the case of a person who works long hours without taking any breaks. This person may experience physical and mental exhaustion, leading to a decline in productivity and overall health. In fact, studies have shown that individuals who work long hours without taking breaks are at a higher risk of developing chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes.

On the other hand, having regular inactive times can have numerous benefits. For example, taking regular breaks can help individuals recharge their batteries and improve their focus and productivity. Additionally, regular inactive times can help individuals develop fresh ideas and creative solutions to problems. Research has also shown that individuals who take regular breaks are at a lower risk of developing chronic diseases and have a longer lifespan.

Personally, I have experienced the benefits of regular inactive times. When I take regular breaks throughout the day, I feel more energized and focused, and I am able to accomplish more in less time. Additionally, taking regular breaks has helped me develop new ideas and solutions to problems I was facing at work.

Firstly, it would give students more flexibility and freedom. They would be able to work at their own pace and schedule their learning around other commitments, such as work or family responsibilities. This would be particularly beneficial for students who live far away from school or who have disabilities that make it difficult to travel.

In addition, distance learning would provide students with access to a wider range of courses and subjects. Schools could offer specialized courses that they may not have the resources or expertise to teach in person. For example, students could take language courses online, or participate in virtual science experiments that may not be possible in a traditional classroom setting.

Furthermore, distance learning would prepare students for the realities of adult life. Many jobs now require employees to work remotely, so students who have experience with distance learning would have an advantage in the workforce.

Of course, there are some potential drawbacks to distance learning. Students may feel isolated and disconnected from the school community, and they would need to be highly self-motivated and disciplined to succeed. Additionally, not everyone has access to the technology necessary for distance learning.

In this essay, I will compare and contrast these two professions to determine which one is better suited to my interests and skill set.

A stylist professional is responsible for helping people look their best by choosing the right clothes and accessories. They work in various settings such as salons, spas, and fashion boutiques. A stylist's typical day involves consulting with clients, selecting clothing and accessories, and styling their hair and makeup. Stylists must have a keen eye for detail, excellent communication skills, and a passion for fashion. They must also be able to work well under pressure and have strong organizational skills.

On the other hand, painting landscapes involves creating beautiful and realistic paintings of natural scenery. Landscape painters work in various settings such as art galleries, museums, and private homes. A landscape painter's typical day involves selecting the right colors, brushes, and paints, and then painting the landscape on canvas. Landscape painters must have a strong understanding of color theory, composition, and perspective. They must also be patient, detail-oriented, and have a passion for nature.

Both professions require creativity and artistic skills, but they differ in their roles and workplaces. Stylists work in a more social setting, where they interact with clients and provide personalized services. Landscape painters, on the other hand, work in a more solitary setting, where they focus on creating their art. In terms of salary, stylists can earn anywhere from $20,000 to $100,000 per year, depending on their experience and location. Landscape painters can earn anywhere from $30,000 to $200,000 per year, depending on their reputation and the demand for their work.

When considering which profession to pursue, I must consider my interests and skill set. I have always had a passion for fashion and enjoy helping people look their best. I also have strong communication and organizational skills, which are essential for a stylist professional. However",1,0.9936965,1,True

First of all, let's talk about attendance. When you force kids to take classes they don't really want to be in, they're gonna be like, super unmotivated to go to school. Like, who wants to sit through an art class when they could be playing video games at home?  And then there's the drama class, which is just, like, super awkward for everyone involved. 

And don't even get me started on the grades. When kids aren't interested in the class, they're not gonna do their best work, which means they're gonna get bad grades. And then they're gonna be like, ""Uh, I'm not gonna go to school because I'm not good at art/music/drama.""  It's just a vicious cycle, man.

But, like, I get it. Some people think that these classes are important for kids to learn stuff and be well-rounded and all that.  I mean, I guess it's cool to learn about different art styles or how to play an instrument or whatever. But, like, can't they just learn that stuff in a more fun way? Like, through electives or something? 

And, like, what about the kids who are actually interested in these classes? They're gonna be, like, super bummed that they have to take them, you know? It's not fair to force kids to do something they don't want to do, just because some people think it's important.

9DB8409B95F6,"Trust is a fundamental aspect of any relationship. It is the foundation upon which all successful relationships are built. When we trust someone, we open ourselves up to them and allow them to have a significant impact on our lives. However, it is important to remember that trust is not always reciprocated, and sometimes it is broken. In this essay, I will discuss the importance of trusting people and not changing for anyone, describe a scenario where I accepted a bad friendship with a person who was not a good influence, discuss how my trust was broken by someone who lied to me and how I lost a friend, explain the lesson I learned from the experience, and describe how someone can determine if a person is a good or bad influence.

Firstly, trust is essential because it allows us to form meaningful connections with others. When we trust someone, we feel comfortable sharing our thoughts, feelings, and vulnerabilities with them. This level of intimacy is not possible without trust. Additionally, trust can lead to a sense of security and stability in our relationships. When we trust someone, we feel confident that they will be there for us and support us through thick and thin.

However, it is important to remember that trust is not always reciprocated. Sometimes, people take advantage of our trust and use it to manipulate us or take advantage of us. This can be a difficult experience, but it is important to remember that it is not our fault. It is not our responsibility to change who we are or what we believe in order to please others. We must remain true to ourselves and our values, even when faced with adversity.

One scenario where I accepted a bad friendship with a person who was not a good influence was when I was in middle school. I had always been interested in fashion and beauty, and this person was a popular girl in school who seemed to have it all. She had a lot of friends, was always well-dressed, and seemed to have the perfect life. I was drawn to her because of her confidence and style, and I wanted to be her friend.

However, as time went on, I realized that this person was not the best influence on me. She was constantly gossiping, spreading rumors about others, and putting people down. She would also pressure me to do things that I was uncomfortable with, such as smoking and drinking. I tried to distance myself from her, but she would always",1,0.99449325,1,True

D752DF2541DD,"Dear Principal [Principal's Name],

I am writing to propose a change to our school's current policy regarding academic eligibility for participation in school sports and activities. Currently, students must maintain a C average to remain eligible for participation in these programs. However, I believe that this policy is too lenient and does not adequately reflect the importance of academic achievement in these extracurricular activities.

After researching other schools' policies, I have found that many schools require a B average to maintain eligibility for sports and activities. I believe that this is a more appropriate standard, as it reflects the importance of academic achievement in these programs.

Furthermore, I believe that this change would have a positive impact on our school's academic performance. By requiring a higher standard for academic achievement, we would be encouraging students to prioritize their studies and work harder to maintain their grades. This would ultimately lead to better academic performance and a stronger school overall.

I understand that this change may be controversial and that some students may object to the higher standard. However, I believe that it is important to prioritize academic achievement in all aspects of our lives, including extracurricular activities. By doing so, we can create a school culture that values academic excellence and encourages students to strive for their best.

In conclusion, I strongly recommend that our school's policy regarding academic eligibility for participation in sports and activities be changed to require a B average. I believe that this change would have a positive impact on our school's academic performance and create a stronger school culture. Thank you for considering my proposal.

6C802D3F5F2A,"Okay, here is my essay on whether true self-esteem comes from praise or achievement:

Self-esteem is a crucial aspect of a person's overall well-being, and it can be challenging to determine whether it comes from praise or achievement. On one hand, praise can make a person feel good about themselves and their abilities, while on the other hand, achievement can provide a sense of accomplishment and self-worth. In this essay, I will explore the arguments for and against each and suggest a conclusion on which one is more effective in fostering true self-esteem.

On the one hand, praise can be a powerful tool for building self-esteem. When someone receives praise for their efforts or accomplishments, it can make them feel appreciated and valued. This can boost their confidence and self-worth, and make them feel more motivated to continue working hard. For example, a teacher might praise a student for their good grades, which can make the student feel proud of themselves and more likely to strive for excellence in the future.

However, there are also arguments against praising someone for deficient work. If someone is constantly praised for work that is not up to par, they may begin to feel like they don't have to put in much effort to succeed. This can lead to a lack of motivation and a false sense of self-esteem. For instance, a parent might constantly praise their child for their artwork, even if it is not very good, which can make the child feel like they don't need to improve.

On the other hand, achievement can also be a source of true self-esteem. When someone works hard and achieves a goal, it can give them a sense of accomplishment and self-worth that is based on their own efforts. This can be more effective than praise because it provides a tangible basis for self-esteem. For example, a student might work hard to study for a test and pass with a high grade, which can give them a sense of accomplishment and self-esteem that is not based on praise.

In conclusion, both praise and achievement can be sources of true self-esteem, but achievement is more effective. While praise can make someone feel good about",1,0.9944865,1,True
llama_70b_v11171,"The legalization of marijuana has been a topic of much debate in recent years. While some argue that it should be legalized, others believe it should remain illegal. In my opinion, marijuana should be legalized.

Firstly, it is important to note that marijuana has several medicinal benefits. It has been proven to help alleviate symptoms of chronic illnesses such as cancer, epilepsy, and multiple sclerosis. Patients who suffer from these illnesses often experience pain, nausea, and loss of appetite, and marijuana has been shown to help alleviate these symptoms. By legalizing marijuana, patients who could benefit from it would be able to access it more easily.

Secondly, legalizing marijuana would help to reduce crime. Currently, the illegal drug trade is a major source of revenue for criminal organizations. By legalizing marijuana, the government would be able to regulate and tax the sale of the drug, taking away a significant source of income for these organizations. Additionally, law enforcement resources would be freed up to focus on more serious crimes.

Thirdly, marijuana is not as harmful as other drugs that are currently legal, such as tobacco and alcohol. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, smoking tobacco is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States, while alcohol is responsible for thousands of deaths each year. Marijuana, on the other hand, has never been linked to a single death.

Furthermore, legalizing marijuana would help to address issues of racial inequality. Studies have shown that African Americans are disproportionately represented on drug-related charges, despite similar usage rates among different racial groups. By legalizing marijuana, we could help to address these disparities and ensure that everyone is treated equally under the law.

Finally, legalizing marijuana would have economic benefits. According to a study by the Tax Foundation, legalizing marijuana could generate up to $28 billion in tax revenue annually. This revenue could be used to fund important public programs and services.

In conclusion, there are many reasons why marijuana should be legalized. It has medicinal benefits, could help reduce crime, is not as harmful as other legal drugs, would help address issues of racial inequality, and could have economic benefits. While there are some concerns about the potential negative effects of legalization, these can be addressed through careful regulation and education. Ultimately, it is time for us to consider the benefits of legalizing marijuana and make a positive change in our society.",1,0.99468285,1,True

There are various factors that contribute to self-esteem, including praise and achievement. While some people believe that praise is the key to building self-esteem, others argue that achievement is the most effective source. In this essay, I will explore both arguments and provide a conclusion on which source is more effective.

Praise is often used as a tool to build self-esteem. It is a way of acknowledging a person's efforts and accomplishments. When someone receives praise for their work, it can boost their confidence and make them feel good about themselves. However, there are some downsides to receiving praise. For example, if a person becomes overly reliant on praise, they may become complacent and stop working hard. Additionally, if a person receives praise for deficient work, it may not be effective in building true self-esteem.

On the other hand, achievement is often seen as a more effective source of self-esteem. When a person achieves something, they feel a sense of accomplishment and pride. This can lead to increased confidence and self-worth. Unlike praise, achievement is not dependent on external validation. It is a personal accomplishment that can be celebrated regardless of what others think.

However, it is important to note that achievement is not always the most effective source of self-esteem. For example, if a person sets unrealistic goals and fails to achieve them, it can lead to feelings of failure and low self-esteem. Additionally, if a person achieves something but does not feel proud of their accomplishment, it may not be effective in building self-esteem.

In conclusion, both praise and achievement can be effective sources of self-esteem. However, it is important to consider the potential downsides of each. Praise can be effective in building confidence and self-worth, but it can also lead to complacency and over-reliance on external validation. Achievement, on the other hand, is a personal accomplishment that can be celebrated regardless of what others think.

When I was younger, I made a mistake of accepting a bad friendship with someone who pushed me to make decisions I was uncomfortable with. Despite their bad influence, I trusted them and allowed myself to be controlled for fear of losing them. I soon learned that this person had lied to me and was not the friend I thought they were. I lost more than just a friend, but my trust and faith in someone else. This experience made me realize the importance of being able to trust other people and not succumb to changing just because it's difficult to stay firm about who you are. 

It's essential to determine if a person is a good influence or a bad influence. This can be done by assessing how someone makes you feel, what kind of advice they give you, and how they react when you refuse to do something they ask you to do. Good influences are encouraging, supportive, and understand when you make the decision to be true to yourself. On the other hand, bad influences are often manipulative, disloyal, and quick to be dishonest when things don't go their way. 

I learned the importance of trusting people, but also verifying if they will be a positive or negative presence in your life.

E36B406AFE70,"Inactivity can be beneficial in more ways than one. Rest is essential for our bodies to recover from daily activities, and can help us stay ahead of our physical and mental health. Taking a break from school or work and catching up on our favorite TV shows can be an excellent way to stimulate our minds and relax our bodies. Hiring household assistants like a butler or maid can help to further free up time and energy, making more time to be inactive. 

In small doses, inactivity can be beneficial for productivity purposes. For example, taking breaks throughout the day to relax and recharge can help us to focus better on tasks that require more energy. Taking some time for self-care can reward us with more mental clarity and improved productivity. 

I experienced the benefits of inactivity firsthand after a particularly long work day. I took a few hours to watch some TV and relax before tackling a big project I had been avoiding. It turns out the break was just what I needed to refresh and recharge my mind, and I was able to complete the project with relative ease. 

For those with limited time or energy to be inactive, hiring a butler or other household assistant might be the way to go.

It is the belief in oneself and one's abilities, and it plays a significant role in how individuals perceive themselves and the world around them. While some may argue that self-esteem is based on external factors such as appearance or social status, I believe that the source of true self-esteem is achievement. In this essay, I will provide evidence to support this claim and discuss how praising great students can help foster a positive learning environment and encourage students to reach their goals.

Firstly, achievement provides a sense of accomplishment and mastery over a particular task or subject. When students achieve something they set their minds to, they feel a sense of pride and satisfaction. This sense of accomplishment can be seen in the smile on a student's face when they solve a difficult problem or receive an A on a test. Achievement provides a sense of purpose and direction in life, and it helps students develop a strong work ethic and resilience.

Secondly, achievement is a tangible measure of one's abilities and potential. When students achieve something, they demonstrate that they possess the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed. This demonstration of competence can be seen in the form of a well-written essay, a successful presentation, or a well-executed experiment. Achievement provides evidence that students are capable of great things and that they have the potential to achieve their goals.

Furthermore, praising great students can help foster a positive learning environment and encourage students to reach their goals. When students are praised for their achievements, they feel valued and appreciated. This feeling of value can motivate students to continue working hard and striving for excellence. Praising great students also sets a positive example for other students to follow. When students see their peers being praised for their achievements, they are more likely to strive for greatness themselves.

One reason why seeking multiple opinions can help is that different people have different perspectives. For example, if you're trying to decide which book to read, you might ask your friend who loves adventure stories and your teacher who loves classic literature. Your friend might recommend a book that's full of action and excitement, while your teacher might suggest a book that's more thought-provoking and has deeper meaning. By hearing both perspectives, you can choose a book that's right for you.

Another reason why it's good to seek multiple opinions is that people can have different areas of expertise. If you're trying to decide which video game to buy, you might ask your brother who's really into sports games and your cousin who loves role-playing games. Your brother might recommend a game that's all about basketball, while your cousin might suggest a game that lets you explore a fantasy world. By talking to both of them, you can get a better sense of what each game has to offer and make a more informed decision.

Finally, seeking multiple opinions can help you avoid bias. If you only ask one person for advice, they might have a personal stake in the decision and try to sway you in a certain direction. For instance, if you're trying to decide which restaurant to go to, you might ask your best friend who works at one of the restaurants. They might try to convince you to go to their restaurant, even if it's not the best choice for you. By asking multiple people, you can get a more balanced view and make a decision that's based on what's best for you.

llama_70b_v11091,"I think that schools should not allow parents to monitor their children's grades and attendance online. Firstly, it's important for kids to have some privacy and independence. If parents are always watching, it can be hard for students to feel like they have control over their own lives. Plus, it can create a lot of pressure for kids to perform well, which can be really stressful. Instead, parents should trust their kids to manage their own schoolwork and grades, and only check in every now and then to make sure everything is on track.

Another reason against online monitoring is that it can create a culture of mistrust. If parents are always monitoring, it can seem like they don't trust their kids to do the right thing. This can damage the relationship between parents and children, and make it harder for kids to feel comfortable coming to their parents with problems or questions.

Furthermore, online monitoring can also be unfair to some students. Not everyone has access to the internet or a computer at home, which means that some kids might not be able to see their grades or attendance online. This could create an unequal playing field, where some students have an advantage over others.

On the other hand, some people might argue that online monitoring can help parents stay informed and involved in their children's education. They might say that it's important for parents to know how their kids are doing in school, so they can help them improve if necessary. But I think there are other ways for parents to stay involved, like attending parent-teacher conferences, volunteering in the classroom, or just asking their kids how their day was. These methods can be just as effective, without creating the negative effects of online monitoring.

In conclusion, while some people might see the benefits of online monitoring, I think it's important for schools to respect students' privacy and independence. Instead of relying on technology, parents should use more traditional methods to stay involved in their children's education.

D4A0BB487395,"Honesty is like a superpower. It's something that can make or break relationships, shape our personalities, and define who we are as individuals. As an 8th grader, I've learned that honesty is not only the right thing to do, but it's also essential for a happy and fulfilling life.

First of all, honesty is important to me because it helps me be true to myself. When I'm honest with myself, I can't hide behind lies or excuses. I have to face the truth, no matter how hard it is. This helps me grow and learn from my mistakes. For example, if I did something wrong, I have to admit it and take responsibility for my actions. It's not easy, but it's better to face the truth than to try to cover it up.

Honesty is also important in my relationships with my family. When I'm honest with them, they know they can trust me. They know that I'll always tell them the truth, no matter what. This builds a strong bond between us, and we can rely on each other. For instance, if I'm struggling in school, I can tell my parents the truth, and they'll help me find a solution. They won't get mad at me or judge me, they'll just help me.

But honesty isn't just important in personal relationships, it's also important in our interactions with others. When we're honest with others, we show them that we respect them and value their feelings. For example, if someone asks me how they look in a new outfit, I'll tell them the truth, even if it's not what they want to hear. I'll say something like, ""Honestly, I think the blue shirt looks better on you."" It might be hard to hear, but at least they know the truth.

Finally, honesty is important because it helps us build trust. When we're honest, we show others that we're reliable and dependable.

While it may seem like a restrictive measure, it has helped me maintain a balance between education, a sense of home, and economic stability. On the other hand, the 10 p.m weekday curfew can be detrimental to these aspects of my life.

Firstly, the midnight weekend curfew allows me to have a sense of freedom and independence. I can go out with my friends, explore new places, and have fun without worrying about getting home late. This sense of freedom is crucial for my development as a teenager, as it allows me to learn responsibility and make my own decisions. However, this freedom can also lead to reckless behavior, such as staying out too late or getting into trouble. It is important for me to strike a balance between having fun and being responsible.

Secondly, the midnight weekend curfew allows me to feel a sense of home and safety. When I come home from hanging out with my friends, I know that I am safe and secure in my own home. This sense of safety is important for my mental health and well-being. However, when I come home late on a weekday, I may feel uneasy or unsafe, especially if I live in an area with high crime rates. This can lead to stress and anxiety, which can negatively impact my academic performance.

Finally, the midnight weekend curfew can also have economic benefits for teenagers. When I am out with my friends, we often spend money on food, entertainment, and other activities. This can help boost the local economy and provide jobs for other teenagers. However, when I come home late on a weekday, I may not have the time or energy to go out and spend money.

Firstly, marijuana is a gateway drug that leads to the use of other illegal drugs. People who start using marijuana are more likely to try harder drugs like cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamines. Secondly, marijuana use can cause mental health problems, including depression, anxiety, and psychosis. It can also lead to addiction, which is a serious issue that can ruin people's lives. Lastly, legalization would make it easier for young people to access marijuana, which would be a bad thing.

In addition to these reasons, there are also some practical problems with legalization. For example, it would be difficult to regulate the production and sale of marijuana. It would also be hard to enforce laws around driving under the influence of marijuana, as there is no reliable test for marijuana intoxication. Furthermore, legalization would send the wrong message to young people, implying that drug use is acceptable and even normal.

In my opinion, students should understand that there is a direct correlation between their academic performance and their ability to participate in activities outside of the classroom. This gracefully encourages students to strive to do their best in school, and understand the importance of working hard to achieve their goals. 

Furthermore, this requirement allows the school to ensure that students can handle the extra workload associated with extracurricular activities, while still balancing their academic responsibilities. Ensuring this balance will lead to increased student success, as well as fewer overwhelmed and stressed students. It is crucial that students take the time to invest in their education and understand the importance of good grades, and this policy encourages them to make the effort. 

Overall, I believe this policy to require a grade C average is a beneficial change for the school activities. It raises the educational standards for our school, while motivating and inspiring students to make the most of their education.",1,0.99453896,1,True

falcon_180b_v1_728,"The use of animals in scientific research has been a topic of ethical debate. This is because it raises questions about the morality of using animals for human benefit. Some people argue that it is wrong to use animals in such a way, while others believe that it is necessary for scientific progress. Personally, I am against the use of animals in scientific research.

Firstly, using animals in scientific research is unethical because it involves causing harm and suffering to innocent creatures. These animals are often subjected to painful experiments and are kept in unnatural conditions. For example, in cosmetic testing, rabbits are often used to test the safety of products. They are forced to inhale or ingest chemicals, which can cause them to suffer from severe burns and blindness. This kind of treatment is cruel and inhumane.

Secondly, animal testing is not always reliable. Animals may react differently to drugs and treatments than humans do. Therefore, the results of animal testing may not be applicable to humans. For instance, a drug that works well in animals may not work as well in humans or may even be harmful. This means that using animals in scientific research is not only cruel, but it can also be ineffective.

Finally, alternatives to animal testing exist and should be used instead. Advances in technology have made it possible to conduct experiments using computer models, cell cultures, and human volunteers. These methods are more ethical and can provide more accurate results. For example, computer modeling can simulate the effects of drugs on the human body without causing harm to animals or humans.

In conclusion, using animals in scientific research is unethical, unreliable, and unnecessary. It is time for society to recognize the value of animal life and to find more humane ways to conduct scientific research. By doing so, we can advance knowledge while also respecting the rights of animals.",1,0.9938822,1,True
BD8683F93B5A,"Voting System for School Assignments

As an eighth-grade student, I believe that having a voting system for school assignments would be beneficial for students. In this essay, I will outline the pros and cons of working with a group or alone on school assignments and explain why I believe working with a group could be the best choice for students.

Working with a group has several advantages. First, working with a group allows for a diverse range of ideas and perspectives. Each member of the group may have a unique perspective or skill set that can contribute to the project's success. Additionally, working with a group can foster collaboration and communication skills, which are essential for success in school and beyond.

However, working with a group also has some disadvantages. For example, group work can be time-consuming, and not all group members may contribute equally. Additionally, group work can be stressful, especially if there are conflicts or disagreements within the group.

On the other hand, working alone has its advantages as well. Working alone allows for more control over the project and the ability to work at one's own pace. Additionally, working alone can be less stressful, as there are no conflicts or disagreements to resolve.

However, working alone also has some disadvantages. For example, working alone can be isolating, and it may be challenging to get feedback on the project. Additionally, working alone may not provide the same opportunities for collaboration and communication skills that working with a group can offer.

In my opinion, working with a group could be the best choice for students. While working with a group has its disadvantages, the benefits of collaboration and communication skills far outweigh the drawbacks. Additionally, working with a group can provide students with a diverse range of ideas and perspectives, which can lead to a more successful project.

In conclusion, having a voting system for school assignments would be beneficial for students. While working with a group and working alone have their advantages and disadvantages, working with a group can provide students with the opportunity to collaborate and communicate effectively, which can lead to a more successful project.",1,0.99443805,1,True
EF9677DEFA79,"As an 8th-grade student, I strongly believe that teachers should allow any student to participate in school sports or activities, regardless of their grade level. Participation in sports and activities is not only beneficial for physical health, but it also provides numerous mental and social benefits that can help students develop into well-rounded individuals. In this essay, I will discuss the importance of participation in sports and activities and propose solutions for how teachers can help students who may not have a 'B' grade or higher be successful.

Firstly, participation in sports and activities is crucial for physical health. It is widely known that regular exercise can help reduce the risk of obesity, heart disease, and other health problems. By participating in sports and activities, students can improve their cardiovascular fitness, build muscle and bone strength, and develop healthy habits that will benefit them throughout their lives. Furthermore, participating in sports and activities can also help students develop a sense of self-confidence and self-esteem, which can have a positive impact on their overall well-being.

Secondly, participation in sports and activities can provide numerous mental and social benefits. For example, it can help reduce stress and anxiety, improve mood and mental health, and promote social skills such as teamwork, communication, and leadership. Additionally, participating in sports and activities can also help students develop a sense of community and belonging, which can be particularly important for students who may feel isolated or disconnected from their peers.

However, some students may not have a 'B' grade or higher and may feel discouraged from participating in sports and activities. To help these students be successful, teachers can take several steps. Firstly, teachers can provide students with extra support and guidance to help them improve their grades. This may include one-on-one tutoring, additional study time, or access to resources such as online study materials or tutoring services. Additionally, teachers can also work with students to identify areas where they may be struggling and develop individualized plans to help them improve.

Another solution is to provide alternative opportunities for students who may not meet the academic requirements for certain sports or activities. For example, teachers could offer modified versions of sports or activities that are designed to be more accessible to students with lower grades. Alternatively, teachers could also consider offering extracurricular activities that are not tied to grades, such as clubs or volunteer opportunities.

C1959178FC53,"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that balancing work and leisure activities is crucial for a healthy and fulfilling life. In today's fast-paced world, it's easy to get caught up in the daily grind of school, work, and other responsibilities. However, it's important to take a step back and prioritize leisure activities as well.

One of the most significant benefits of balancing work and leisure activities is that it allows individuals to maintain a healthy work-life balance. When people spend too much time at work, they risk burnout, stress, and other negative consequences. On the other hand, when people prioritize leisure activities, they can reduce stress levels, improve their mental health, and increase their overall well-being.

For example, studies have shown that engaging in regular physical activity can improve cognitive function, reduce stress levels, and improve sleep quality. Additionally, engaging in hobbies and other leisure activities can provide individuals with a sense of purpose and fulfillment outside of work. This can lead to increased job satisfaction and a more positive outlook on life.

However, having an imbalanced lifestyle can have negative consequences. When people spend too much time at work and neglect leisure activities, they risk experiencing burnout and other negative outcomes. For example, a study by the American Psychological Association found that people who work long hours are more likely to experience depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues.

Furthermore, an imbalanced lifestyle can lead to decreased productivity and job performance. When people are overworked and under-rested, they are more likely to make mistakes, miss deadlines, and experience decreased focus and motivation. This can lead to decreased job satisfaction and a negative impact on career advancement.

In conclusion, balancing work and leisure activities is crucial for a healthy and fulfilling life. By prioritizing leisure activities and maintaining a healthy work-life balance, individuals can reduce stress levels, improve their mental health, and increase their overall well-being. On the other hand, an imbalanced lifestyle can lead to negative consequences such as burnout, decreased productivity, and job performance.

B3F18E671DF2,"As an 8th-grade student, I strongly believe that it is not a good decision to lengthen school hours. While some may argue that longer school days would provide more opportunities for learning and academic success, I believe that the benefits do not outweigh the drawbacks. In this essay, I will provide evidence from my personal experiences and explain how teachers, students, and other school personnel would be affected by the decision. Additionally, I will suggest alternative solutions to extend learning opportunities without increasing school hours.

Firstly, I believe that longer school days would negatively impact the mental and physical health of students. As an 8th-grade student, I can attest to the fact that staying in school for longer periods can lead to exhaustion and decreased productivity. This is especially true for students who have extracurricular activities or part-time jobs. Furthermore, studies have shown that students who attend school for longer hours are more likely to experience stress, anxiety, and depression. In addition, longer school days can lead to a decrease in physical activity, which can contribute to obesity and other health problems.

Secondly, lengthening school hours would put an additional burden on teachers and other school personnel. Teachers already work long hours, and extending school hours would require them to spend even more time in the classroom. This could lead to burnout and decreased job satisfaction, which could ultimately lead to a shortage of qualified teachers. Additionally, other school personnel such as custodians, librarians, and counselors would also be affected by the decision. This could lead to increased stress and decreased work-life balance.

Finally, I believe that there are alternative solutions to extend learning opportunities without increasing school hours. For example, schools could offer after-school programs or summer camps to provide students with additional opportunities to learn and grow. Additionally, schools could partner with local businesses or organizations to provide internships or apprenticeships for students. These opportunities would provide students with real-world experience and help them develop valuable skills.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that it is not a good decision to lengthen school hours. The benefits of longer school days do not outweigh the drawbacks, and the decision would negatively impact the mental and physical health of students, as well as the well-being of teachers and other school personnel. Instead, schools should explore alternative solutions",1,0.9945897,1,True
A9A6B5A288DC,"As an 8th-grade student, I believe that building self-esteem is crucial for students of all ages. Self-esteem refers to the way we perceive ourselves and our abilities, and it can greatly impact our academic and personal lives. In this essay, I will research different ways to build self-esteem in students, identify the benefits of having good self-esteem, analyze the importance of believing in yourself as a student, compare the significance of focusing on effort vs. results, consider the impact of praise and encouragement, and examine the importance of setting goals in order to strengthen self-esteem.

Firstly, research has shown that there are several ways to build self-esteem in students. One effective method is to encourage students to engage in activities that challenge them and help them develop new skills. This can include participating in sports, clubs, or other extracurricular activities. Additionally, providing students with opportunities to take on leadership roles and make decisions can also help build self-esteem. Finally, it is important to create a supportive and positive environment in the classroom, where students feel valued and respected by their teachers and peers.

Having good self-esteem has numerous benefits for students. For one, it can lead to improved academic performance, as students are more likely to believe in their abilities and take on challenges. Additionally, good self-esteem can help students develop healthy relationships with others, as they are more likely to trust and respect themselves. Furthermore, students with high self-esteem are more likely to have positive mental health and well-being, as they are less likely to experience anxiety and depression.

As a student, it is essential to believe in yourself and your abilities. This means taking risks and stepping out of your comfort zone, even when it may be scary or challenging. Believing in yourself can help you overcome obstacles and achieve your goals, as you are more likely to have the confidence and motivation to keep going. Furthermore, believing in yourself can help you develop a growth mindset, where you view challenges as opportunities for learning and growth, rather than as threats to your self-worth.

Working in groups is way more fun than working alone. Like, I know some people might prefer to work alone because they think it's more productive, but let's be real, it's not always the most fun. When you're working in a group, you get to brainstorm together, share ideas, and bounce off each other's thoughts. It's like, way more interactive and engaging. Plus, you get to learn from each other's strengths and weaknesses, which can make the project way better.

One of the biggest benefits of working in groups is that you can divide tasks and responsibilities. Like, if you're working on a project for school, you might have to research a topic, create a presentation, and write a report. If you're working alone, you'd have to do all of those things yourself, which can be super overwhelming. But if you're in a group, you can assign each person a different task, so it's way more manageable. Plus, you can help each other out if someone's struggling with their part.

Another cool thing about working in groups is that you can bounce ideas off each other. Like, if you're brainstorming ideas for a project, you might come up with something really cool, but then your group member might have a better idea. It's like, you can build on each other's ideas and create something way more innovative than you could have done alone. And it's not just about the ideas, but also the way you can support each other. If someone's feeling stressed or overwhelmed, you can be there for them and help them out.

But, of course, there are also some drawbacks to working in groups. Like, sometimes people can get distracted or not pull their weight. It's like, you might be doing all the work while your group members are just chillin' and not contributing. And sometimes, you might have different opinions or ideas, which can lead to conflicts.

CC30C03474B1,"Perseverance is a crucial aspect of achieving goals. It is the ability to keep pushing forward even when faced with obstacles and setbacks. Perseverance is important because it allows individuals to overcome challenges and continue working towards their goals. Without perseverance, individuals may give up too easily and never achieve their full potential.

There are many examples of how perseverance can lead to success. For example, Thomas Edison failed thousands of times when trying to invent the light bulb. However, he continued to work on his invention and eventually succeeded. Without his perseverance, the light bulb may never have been invented.

On the other hand, perseverance can also lead to failure. For example, if an individual continues to make the same mistakes over and over again, they may never achieve their goals. It is important to learn from mistakes and avoid repeating them in order to achieve success.

Family support is also an important factor in achieving goals. A supportive family can provide encouragement and motivation to help individuals stay on track. For example, if an individual is trying to lose weight, a supportive family may help by cooking healthy meals and encouraging exercise. Without family support, it may be more difficult to achieve goals.

However, family support can also lead to failure. For example, if a family member is not supportive of an individual's goals, it may be difficult to stay motivated and on track. It is important to have a supportive family, but it is also important to be responsible for achieving one's own goals.

Successes and failures are both important in order to develop as a person. Successes provide a sense of accomplishment and motivation to continue working towards goals. Failures provide an opportunity to learn from mistakes and improve in the future. It is important to view both successes and failures as learning experiences.

In this essay, we will explore the pros and cons of distance learning as an option for students attending school, compared to attending classes in person. We will consider factors such as stress relief, the ability to learn better, and time management.

One of the main advantages of distance learning is the stress relief it provides. Students who attend classes in person may experience a great deal of stress due to the hustle and bustle of the school environment. There may be distractions, social pressures, and other factors that contribute to this stress. In contrast, students who attend classes remotely can create a more comfortable and personalized learning environment. They can choose when and where to study, and they can tailor their learning experience to their individual needs.

Another advantage of distance learning is the ability to learn better. Students who attend classes in person may struggle to keep up with the pace of their teachers or may feel overwhelmed by the amount of material they need to cover. In contrast, students who attend classes remotely can take the time they need to understand the material. They can also access a wide range of resources, such as videos, articles, and interactive tools, that can help them learn more effectively.

However, there are also some disadvantages to distance learning. One of the main disadvantages is the potential for poor time management. Students who attend classes in person may have a more structured schedule, which can help them stay on track. In contrast, students who attend classes remotely may struggle to manage their time effectively. They may procrastinate or become distracted, which can lead to missed deadlines and poor grades.

Another disadvantage of distance learning is the potential for social isolation. Students who attend classes in person have the opportunity to interact with their peers and teachers on a regular basis. This can help them build relationships and feel connected to their school community. In contrast, students who attend classes remotely may feel isolated and disconnected from their peers and teachers.

llama_70b_v157,"I think we should ban single-use plastics. They are bad for the earth and us. They pollute our oceans and hurt animals. For example, plastic bags can choke turtles and birds who think they are food. Plastic straws are also bad because they are used once and then thrown away. We can use paper straws instead. They are biodegradable and don't harm animals.

Another reason to ban single-use plastics is that they are not sustainable. We are running out of space to put our trash. Landfills are filling up and it's a big problem. We need to reduce our waste and using reusable products is a better way to do that. For example, we can use reusable bags and water bottles instead of disposable ones.

Furthermore, single-use plastics are also harmful to our health. BPA, a chemical found in plastics, can leach into food and drinks and cause cancer and other health problems. It's not worth the risk. Glass and stainless steel are safer alternatives.

In conclusion, single-use plastics are bad for the environment, unsustainable, and harmful to our health. We should ban them and use reusable products instead. It's time to make a change and be more responsible with our waste.

Please provide feedback on the essay, including suggestions for improvement, areas of strength, and areas for improvement.

Feedback:

Overall, your essay provides a clear argument for banning single-use plastics. You have provided several convincing reasons and examples to support your position. However, there are some areas where you could improve your essay.

Firstly, consider adding more specific statistics and data to support your claims. For example, you mention that plastic bags can choke turtles and birds, but you could provide data on the number of animals that have died due to plastic pollution. Similarly, you mention that single-use plastics are not sustainable, but you could provide data on the amount of waste that is produced each year and the impact it has on the environment.

Secondly, consider adding more nuance to your argument. While single-use plastics are certainly a problem, there may be some situations where they are necessary or more practical. For example, some people may not have access to clean water or sanitary facilities, and single-use plastic bottles or bags may be their only option. Consider acknowledging these exceptions and discussing ways to address these issues while still reducing our reliance on single-use plastics.

Thirdly, consider improving your sentence structure and grammar. There are several places where your sentences are awkwardly phrased or contain grammatical errors. For example, in the second paragraph, you write ""We need to reduce our waste and using reusable products is a better way to do that."" This sentence could be rephrased as ""Reducing our waste is essential, and using reusable products is a more effective way to achieve this goal.""

Finally, consider adding more varied and sophisticated vocabulary to your essay. While your essay is clear and easy to understand, some of the language is quite simple. Consider using more technical terms related to environmental science or sustainability to make your argument more convincing.

Hey, so like, I know some people think that schools should decide which extracurricular activities students can join, but I think it's way better if students get to decide for themselves. Here's why:

First of all, students are like, way more interested in stuff they want to do, you know? If they don't want to join band, they're not gonna be all motivated to practice and stuff. But if they get to choose, they might be more into it and put more effort into it. Same with sports or clubs or whatever. They're more likely to stick with it if they get to pick.

And it's not just about motivation. When students get to choose their own extracurriculars, they can find things that they're actually good at and enjoy.

DA228B928B61,"In recent years, the COVID-19 pandemic has forced many schools to switch to online learning, and this has led to a debate about the pros and cons of taking classes from home. While some people argue that online learning is better than traditional classroom learning, others believe that it has its drawbacks. In this essay, I will discuss both sides of the argument and provide my own perspective on the matter.

One of the main advantages of taking classes from home is the flexibility it provides. Students can learn at their own pace and on their own schedule, which can be especially beneficial for those who have other commitments, such as jobs or family responsibilities. Additionally, online classes often allow students to access course materials and lectures at any time, which can make it easier to fit learning into busy schedules.

Another advantage of online learning is that it can be more convenient for students who live in remote areas. Without the need to commute to a physical campus, students can save time and money on transportation, and they can also access courses that may not be available in their local area.

However, there are also some disadvantages to taking classes from home. One of the main drawbacks is the lack of social interaction that can come with online learning. In a traditional classroom, students have the opportunity to interact with their peers and teachers on a regular basis, which can help them build relationships and learn from each other. Without this interaction, students may feel isolated and disconnected from their classmates.

Another disadvantage of online learning is that it can be more difficult to stay motivated. Without the structure of a traditional classroom, students may struggle to stay on track with their coursework and may be more likely to procrastinate. Additionally, the lack of face-to-face interaction with teachers can make it more challenging to get help and support when needed.

In my opinion, taking classes from home has both its advantages and disadvantages. While the flexibility and convenience can be beneficial, the lack of social interaction and motivation can be a challenge. Ultimately, the decision to take classes from home should be based on an individual's specific needs and circumstances. For some students, the benefits may outweigh the drawbacks, while for others, the opposite may be true.

In conclusion, the debate about the pros and cons of taking classes from home is a complex one. While online learning can provide flexibility",1,0.9944459,1,True
C77A361A7476,"The decision to leave high school early is becoming more commonplace, with more students opting to finish their studies prior to the conventional date. This can have both positive and negative implications for the student and the school. On the one hand, it gives the student a chance to enter the workforce or college early, and possibly gain more experience. On the other hand, it can deprive the student of crucial educational opportunities and the chance to make important social connections with peers. 

For the school, there are a variety of pros and cons to consider. Since students are spending less time in school, there may be a decrease in total revenue, especially if the school relies heavily on funding through student tuition. Alternatively, it may enable schools to focus their resources and attention on those students who are more likely to stay for all four years.

It is important to consider the long-term implications of leaving school early, for both the student and the school. Short-term benefits may not be realized in the future, as a lack of certain qualifications and experiences may place students at a disadvantage. The consequences of having more students finishing high school early should be taken into account when making this decision.",1,0.9945591,1,True

In my opinion, being successful in life is not just about achieving material possessions or career advancement, but also about finding fulfillment and happiness.

One way to be successful in life while staying true to oneself is to set realistic goals and work towards them consistently. It is important to set goals that align with your values and passions, rather than just focusing on what others expect of you. By setting achievable goals, you can focus on making progress and feeling a sense of accomplishment, without sacrificing your authenticity.

Another way to be successful in life while staying true to oneself is to surround yourself with positive and supportive people. It is important to have a network of friends and family who encourage and support you in your journey. By surrounding yourself with positive influences, you can stay motivated and focused on your goals, while still maintaining your unique personality and values.

It is also important to remember that success is not just about what you achieve, but also about how you achieve it. By staying true to yourself and following your own path, you can find a sense of purpose and fulfillment in your life. This can lead to greater success in the long run, as you will be more motivated and focused on achieving your goals.

I think it's a good idea to have a grade B average to participate in sports or other activities. It's not fair to the kids who are working really hard and getting good grades to be on the same team as kids who don't really care about school and are just there to have fun. Also, if we want to play sports in collage we have to have good grades. So it's good to start early.

I know some kids might say that it's not fair to kids who are not as smart or who have learning disabilities, but there are ways to help those kids too. They can have special tutors or classes to help them get better grades. And if they still can't get a B average, they can still participate in other ways, like managing the team or being a cheerleader.

Also, having good grades will help us in the future. We need good grades to get into college and get a good job. So it's important to learn how to balance school and sports. It will help us to be more responsible and mature.

One of the best things about playing in a park is the sense of community it creates. Taking part in a game is a great way to get to know your neighbors and neighbors from the local area. It's also a great way to meet new people, since parks often attract people from wider afield.

Playing a sport in a park also provides an opportunity to enjoy the sights and sounds of nature. The sounds of birds singing is a sure sign that spring has sprung. The luscious green grass provides an inviting spot to stretch out after a hard-fought game.

In addition, there is often an array of park amenities that can be enjoyed before and after your game. These can include playgrounds, picnic tables, and barbecues. You can plan an afternoon of sport and relaxation with your family or friends.

E7328989C861,"Imagination and knowledge are two essential aspects of life that help us make informed decisions. However, while knowledge is crucial, imagination can be equally beneficial in certain situations. In this essay, I will explore the benefits of imagination over knowledge in making life decisions.

Firstly, imagination can help us choose the right thing to do. When faced with a difficult decision, knowledge can be overwhelming, and it can be challenging to weigh all the pros and cons. On the other hand, imagination can provide us with a clearer picture of the situation, allowing us to make a more informed decision. For example, when deciding on a career path, imagination can help us visualize ourselves in different roles and industries, allowing us to choose the one that aligns with our passions and interests.

Secondly, knowledge can create a lot of pressure. When we have a lot of knowledge about a particular topic, it can be challenging to make a decision, as we are constantly weighing the pros and cons. This pressure can lead to indecision, which can be detrimental in certain situations. For example, when deciding on a college major, knowledge about different fields of study can be overwhelming, leading to indecision and a lack of direction. In contrast, imagination can provide us with a clearer picture of our goals and aspirations, allowing us to make a decision with confidence.

Thirdly, knowledge can affect the future. While knowledge is essential for success, it can also limit our potential. When we have too much knowledge about a particular subject, we can become too focused on the details and lose sight of the big picture. This can limit our ability to think creatively and innovatively, which can be detrimental in certain situations. For example, when starting a business, knowledge about the industry can be helpful, but too much knowledge can limit our ability to think outside the box and come up with new and innovative ideas. In contrast, imagination can provide us with the ability to think creatively and innovatively, allowing us to succeed in the future.

Finally, imagination can help us succeed in college. College is a time of transition, and it can be challenging to navigate the complexities of higher education. When faced with new challenges, knowledge can be overwhelming, leading to indecision and a lack of direction.

These small acts can range from offering a smile or a compliment to someone, to lending a helping hand to someone in need. In this essay, I will explore the idea that small acts of kindness can have a profound impact on others, and provide examples of how they can make a difference.

One example of the impact of small acts of kindness is the butterfly effect, which suggests that even the smallest actions can have a ripple effect that can change the course of history. For instance, a simple act of kindness, such as giving someone a compliment, can boost their self-esteem and make them feel more confident in themselves. This, in turn, can lead to them treating others with kindness and respect, creating a positive cycle of behavior.

Another example of the impact of small acts of kindness is the idea of the ""pay it forward"" movement. This movement encourages people to perform acts of kindness for others, and then pass those acts on to someone else. For example, if someone pays for your coffee, you can then pay for someone else's coffee. This creates a chain reaction of kindness that can have a significant impact on the world.

Small acts of kindness can also have a practical impact on others. For instance, if someone is struggling with a difficult task, offering to lend them a helping hand can make all the difference. This can be as simple as offering to proofread their work or helping them with their homework. This kind of assistance can help someone overcome their struggles and achieve their goals, creating a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction.

In conclusion, small acts of kindness can have a profound impact on others, even if they may seem insignificant at first glance.

As an 8th grader, I have learned that character traits are essential for personal growth and development. Through research and exploration, I have discovered why certain traits are important, how they are shaped by environment, upbringing, and personal experiences, and how influential people have inspired the development of these traits. I will examine the differences in how kids and adults approach developing character traits and analyze the consequences of choosing certain traits.

Character traits are the qualities that define who we are as individuals. They can be good or bad, and they shape our interactions with others and our experiences in life. For instance, having empathy and kindness can make us more compassionate and understanding towards others, while being brave and resilient can help us overcome challenges and obstacles. Research has shown that these traits are shaped by our environment, upbringing, and personal experiences. For example, someone who has grown up in a nurturing and supportive environment is more likely to develop empathy and kindness, while someone who has faced adversity and challenges may develop resilience and determination.

Influential people throughout history have also inspired the development of certain character traits. For instance, Nelson Mandela's perseverance and dedication to fighting against injustice have inspired many to stand up for what they believe in and fight for what is right. Similarly, Malala Yousafzai's courage and determination in the face of adversity have inspired many to speak out against injustice and fight for the rights of others. These individuals have shown us that with hard work and determination, we can develop character traits that can help us make a positive impact on the world.

However, kids and adults differ in their approach to developing character traits. Children are still learning and developing their traits, and they may need more guidance and support from adults. Adults, on the other hand, may have a more established set of traits and may be more focused on refining and improving them. Additionally, adults may be more aware of the consequences of choosing certain character traits, and they may be more motivated to develop traits that will help",1,0.9945505,1,True
E7A9FD471BE3,"Graduating early from high school has been a topic of debate for many years. Some people believe that graduating early is a great accomplishment that can lead to more opportunities in the future, while others argue that it may not be the best decision for everyone. In this essay, I will discuss the pros and cons of graduating early from high school.

One of the biggest advantages of graduating early from high school is that it can lead to more opportunities in the future. Many colleges and universities offer scholarships and financial aid for students who graduate early. Additionally, graduating early can give students a head start on their career path. For example, if a student wants to pursue a career in a specific field, graduating early can allow them to start their education or training in that field sooner.

Another advantage of graduating early from high school is that it can give students a sense of accomplishment and pride. Graduating early can be a great way for students to show their dedication and hard work. It can also give them a sense of confidence and self-esteem that can help them in their future endeavors.

However, there are also some disadvantages to graduating early from high school. One of the biggest disadvantages is that it can be difficult for students to find jobs or internships if they graduate too early. Many companies require a certain level of education or experience before they will consider hiring a candidate. If a student graduates too early, they may not have enough experience or education to qualify for certain jobs or internships.

Another disadvantage of graduating early from high school is that it can be challenging for students to keep up with their peers. Many students who graduate early may feel isolated or left out because they are not with their peers who are still in high school. This can be especially challenging for students who are used to being with their peers and having a support system.

In conclusion, graduating early from high school has both advantages and disadvantages. While it can lead to more opportunities in the future and give students a sense of accomplishment, it can also be difficult for students to find jobs or internships and can be challenging for them to keep up with their peers. Ultimately, the decision to graduate early from high school should be carefully considered and based on the individual student's goals and circumstances.",1,0.99457645,1,True

Cows take up so much room and they make so much poop. It's bad for the soil and it's bad for the air. We should just eat plants instead. They're good for us and they don't hurt the earth as much. Plus, plants are yummy! Have you tried tofu? It's so good! And you can put it in anything. My favorite is tofu stir-fry with broccoli and carrots. It's so good!

Also, meat is bad for our bodies. My mom's friend had a heart attack and the doctor said it was because he ate too much meat. He had to go vegan and now he's way healthier. My mom too, she used to eat a lot of meat and now she has diabetes. But since she started eating more plants, she feels better. I don't want to get diabetes or have a heart attack, so I'm going to eat more plants too.

I also know that some people might say that it's too hard to go vegan because you can't eat certain things. But it's not that hard. You can still eat pizza, just without the pepperoni. You can still have pasta, just without the meatballs. And there are so many yummy vegan desserts! Have you tried vegan chocolate chip cookies? They're the best!

Over time I developed a strong sense of confidence and an inclination towards taking risks, traits that I would not have had access to without my friend's influence. Similarly, if a person is raised in an environment where creativity is actively encouraged and supported, they are more likely to be inventive and curious throughout their life.

Some schools have also started to adopt these practices in order to promote a more positive learning environment for students. However, there is still debate on whether or not meditation and mindfulness practices should be included in schools. In this essay, I will argue in favor of the inclusion of these practices in schools.

Firstly, meditation and mindfulness practices have been proven to improve mental health and reduce stress levels. With the increasing pressure and demands placed on students today, stress is becoming a major issue in schools. The incorporation of meditation and mindfulness practices can provide students with tools and techniques to manage their stress levels more effectively. For example, a study conducted in 2015 found that mindfulness meditation significantly reduced anxiety and stress levels in high school students.

In addition, these practices can also improve students' focus and attention span. With the constant distractions and stimuli in today's world, it can be difficult for students to stay focused and engaged in their studies. Mindfulness practices such as deep breathing exercises and visualization techniques can help students to refocus their attention and improve their concentration levels.

Furthermore, meditation and mindfulness practices can also promote social and emotional learning in students. These practices help to develop empathy, self-awareness, and compassion in individuals. In a school setting, this can help students develop better interpersonal relationships and create a more positive and supportive school culture.

While some may argue that the incorporation of meditation and mindfulness practices may be too time-consuming or distracting from academic learning, the benefits they offer far outweigh any potential drawbacks. Additionally, these practices can be easily incorporated into the school day, such as through short guided meditations or mindfulness exercises at the beginning or end of class.

In conclusion, the inclusion of meditation and mindfulness practices in schools can provide numerous physical and mental health benefits for students, as well as promote a more positive and supportive learning environment.

9DF267887BEB,"Deceptive Behaviors and First Impressions

In our daily lives, we often encounter people who use deceptive behaviors to get something or attention. These behaviors can range from small white lies to more serious actions, such as cheating or lying on a resume. While it is important to be honest and trustworthy, there are times when first impressions can be misleading.

For example, a job interviewer may be impressed by a candidate's appearance or their ability to speak confidently, even if their qualifications are not as strong as other candidates. In this case, the candidate may use deceptive behaviors, such as exaggerating their experience or skills, to further impress the interviewer. While this may lead to a job offer, it can also lead to negative consequences down the line.

On the other hand, there are times when first impressions can be accurate. For example, if a person is consistently rude or disrespectful to others, it is likely that they will continue to behave this way in the future. In this case, it is important to use first impressions to make informed decisions about whether or not to interact with the person further.

When it comes to getting a job, it is important to be honest and straightforward in your application materials. While it may be tempting to exaggerate your qualifications or experience, this can lead to negative consequences down the line. Instead, focus on highlighting your strengths and qualifications in a clear and concise manner.

People may change their behavior in order to impress others for a variety of reasons. Some people may do this because they want to fit in with a particular group or because they want to be seen as successful or accomplished. Others may do this because they want to avoid conflict or because they want to be liked or admired.

However, it is important to remember that people are not always who they seem to be. While it may be tempting to judge someone based on their behavior, it is important to consider other factors as well, such as their background and experiences.

In conclusion, while deceptive behaviors can be tempting, it is important to be honest and straightforward in all aspects of our lives.

BB06ADBF1640,"Attending school is one of the most important aspects of a person's life. It provides a foundation for future success and sets the stage for a fulfilling career. However, for some students, prioritizing education can be challenging. In this essay, I will argue that attending school is crucial for achieving success and why some students may find it difficult to do so.

Firstly, school provides students with a solid educational foundation, which is essential for future success. Learning various subjects such as math, science, and English helps students develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills. These skills are necessary for success in any field, whether it be medicine, engineering, or business. Furthermore, attending school exposes students to various extracurricular activities, such as sports, music, and art, which help them develop their passions and interests. These activities not only provide students with a creative outlet but also help them build essential life skills such as teamwork, communication, and time management.

However, despite the importance of education, some students may find it challenging to prioritize school. Many students have to balance school with work and family responsibilities, which can make it difficult to focus on their studies. For example, students who work part-time jobs to support their families may find it hard to keep up with their schoolwork. Additionally, some students may struggle with personal issues such as bullying, which can make school a challenging and unpleasant experience.

Despite these challenges, it is crucial for students to prioritize their education. Attending school provides students with opportunities for personal growth and development. It helps them build confidence, develop social skills, and prepare for the challenges of adulthood. Furthermore, attending school can lead to better career opportunities and higher earning potential. According to a study by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, individuals with a high school diploma earn an average of $700 more per week than those without one.

In conclusion, attending school is essential for future success.

I mean, think about it, these people have way more experience and knowledge than we do, so why not use their expertise to help us make the best choices?

One time when I realized the importance of seeking guidance was when I was trying to decide which high school to attend. My parents and I were like, totally stuck on which one to choose, and we couldn't agree on anything. But then we talked to our school counselor, and she gave us some really good advice. She helped us look at the pros and cons of each school and even gave us some inside info on which one was better for me. Without her help, I probably would have chosen a school that wasn't the best fit for me.

But, of course, there are also times when relying on experts can be bad. Like, if you're trying to make a decision about something that you're really passionate about, you might want to trust your own instincts instead of someone else's opinion. For example, if you're trying to decide which extracurricular activity to join, you might want to think about what you're actually interested in and what will make you happy, rather than what some expert says is the best choice.

Another thing to consider is that sometimes experts can be wrong. Like, I heard that some doctors used to think that smoking was good for you, but now we know that's not true. So, it's important to be open-minded and not just blindly follow what someone tells you.

Also, I think it's important to communicate effectively with others when making decisions. Like, if you're trying to decide on a movie to watch with your friends, you should make sure to listen to everyone's opinions and find a movie that everyone will enjoy. And if you're making a decision with your family, you should make sure to include their opinions too.

Lastly, I think it's important to think about the consequences of our decisions. Like, if we make a bad decision, it could lead to bad things happening, like violence. So, it's important to be careful and think things through before making",1,0.99439985,1,True
AB9FC91ABAD7,"Humans are by nature inquisitive and independent, and the ability to make their own decisions is essential to growth and development. Making one's own decisions is key to developing a sense of self-efficacy and internal locus of control. When we make our own decisions, we become responsible for their consequences, both positive and negative, and the lessons that we can learn from them remain with us. 

Decision-making also requires us to weigh the consequences of different options in order to choose the one that is most advantageous. This helps foster logical and rational thinking, problem-solving skills, and the ability to make objective decisions, which are all important steps for personal growth. Additionally, our own decisions allow us to understand how we are in control of our own destiny and to learn the importance of taking responsibility for what we do. 

By embracing autonomy, complexity, and responsibility, we become better able to use our own judgment and creativity to solve challenges, identify goals, and set achievable objectives. This is how we truly start to take control of our lives and reach our potential as self-fulfilled, independent individuals.

As an 8th grader, I've experienced my fair share of failures. From botched science experiments to poorly written essays, I've learned that failure is an inevitable part of the learning process. But is failure truly a hindrance to success, or can it actually be a stepping stone towards it? In this essay, I'll explore the various views on the role of failure in the pursuit of success and share my own opinion on the matter.

On one hand, some people believe that failure is a necessary evil in the journey towards success. According to a popular saying, "" Failure is not the opposite of success, it's a part of success."" (Unknown). Failure allows us to learn from our mistakes, identify our weaknesses, and improve ourselves. For instance, Thomas Edison, the inventor of the light bulb, is famously quoted as saying, ""I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."" By embracing failure, Edison was able to refine his ideas and ultimately achieve his goal.

On the other hand, some people believe that failure can be a major obstacle to success. When we fail, we may become discouraged and give up on our goals altogether. As the saying goes, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts."" (Winston Churchill). In this sense, failure can indeed be a roadblock to success, as it can erode our confidence and motivation.

However, I believe that failure can also be a catalyst for success. When we fail, we are given the opportunity to reflect on our actions, identify what went wrong, and make improvements. As the saying goes, ""The only way to do great work is to love what you do."" (Steve Jobs). If we are passionate about our goals, we are more likely to persevere through failure and keep working towards success.

First impressions are like, super important, right? Like, you know, when you meet someone new, you get like, a few seconds to make a good impression. And sometimes, it's hard to change that first impression once it's been made. But, like, I think it's totally possible to change them!

I mean, think about it. Have you ever met someone who seemed really mean or boring at first, but then you got to know them and they were actually really cool? Like, I know this girl in my class who seemed really stuck up at first, but then we started hanging out and she's actually really funny and nice. So, like, yeah, first impressions can totally be changed!

But, like, sometimes it's not that easy. Sometimes people can be really judgmental at first and it's hard to change their minds. Like, my brother used to think that my best friend was weird and he wouldn't hang out with her. But then he got to know her better and now he's like, totally cool with her. So, like, it's not always impossible to change first impressions!

And, like, research shows that first impressions can be changed! Like, there was this study where people were shown a bunch of pictures of people and they had to rate how likable they were. And then they were shown the same pictures again, but this time with a different background. And, like, the people who were rated as less likable at first were actually rated as more likable after the second time!

C76DBCE18AF0,"First impressions are a crucial aspect of our lives. They are the initial perceptions we have of someone or something, and they can greatly influence our future interactions with them. However, changing these initial perceptions can be challenging. In this essay, I will discuss why first impressions are almost impossible to change and provide examples from personal experiences to illustrate their effects.

First impressions are formed based on a variety of factors, including physical appearance, body language, and tone of voice. These initial perceptions can be influenced by a person's clothing, grooming, and overall demeanor. For example, if someone walks into a room with their head held high, wearing a confident smile, and speaking with a strong, assertive tone of voice, it is likely that others will perceive them as confident and outgoing.

However, changing these initial perceptions can be difficult. Once someone has formed an opinion about someone or something, it can be challenging to alter that perception. For example, if someone has formed a negative first impression of a coworker based on their appearance or demeanor, it can be difficult to change that perception even if the coworker later demonstrates positive qualities.

Personal experiences have also shown me that first impressions can be difficult to change. For example, when I first met my current best friend, I was hesitant to get to know them because of their quiet and reserved nature. However, as I got to know them better, I realized that they were actually very outgoing and had a great sense of humor. Despite my initial reservations, I was able to form a strong friendship with them based on their positive qualities, and my first impression of them was no longer accurate.

Another example from my personal experiences is when I met someone online who I found very attractive. Based on their profile picture and initial messages, I formed a positive first impression of them. However, as we continued to communicate, I realized that they were not as kind or considerate as I had initially thought. Despite my initial positive impression, I was able to form a more accurate perception of them based on their actions and behavior.

In conclusion, first impressions are almost impossible to change. They are formed based on a variety of factors, including physical appearance, body language, and tone of voice. Changing these initial perceptions can be difficult, and personal experiences have shown me that first impress",1,0.9945643,1,True
A84FFDD09442,"A Positive Attitude: The Key to Success and Happiness

In today's fast-paced world, having a positive attitude is essential for success and happiness. A positive attitude allows individuals to approach challenges with optimism, resilience, and determination. In this essay, I will explore the benefits of having a positive attitude, provide examples of people who have overcome obstacles with a positive attitude, and discuss how having a positive attitude can help in personal relationships and in the workplace.

Firstly, having a positive attitude has numerous benefits in life. Research has shown that people with a positive attitude tend to have better physical and mental health, lower stress levels, and higher levels of happiness and satisfaction. A positive attitude also helps individuals to focus on opportunities rather than problems, leading to better decision-making and problem-solving skills. Furthermore, a positive attitude can lead to increased motivation, creativity, and productivity, which can result in greater success in various areas of life.

One of the most inspiring examples of people overcoming obstacles with a positive attitude is the story of Nick Vujicic. Nick was born without legs or arms, but he never let his disability define him. Instead, he developed a positive attitude and used his unique perspective to inspire others. Nick's message of hope and positivity resonated with people around the world, and he became a motivational speaker and author. Nick's story is a testament to the power of a positive attitude in overcoming adversity.

In personal relationships, having a positive attitude can help individuals to build stronger connections with others. When people approach relationships with a positive attitude, they tend to be more empathetic, understanding, and compassionate, which can lead to better communication and trust. Additionally, a positive attitude can help individuals to navigate conflicts and challenges in relationships with greater ease and effectiveness.

In the workplace, having a positive attitude can be the key to success. When people approach their work with a positive attitude, they tend to be more productive, creative, and motivated. They also tend to have better relationships with their colleagues and supervisors, which can lead to greater opportunities for advancement and success. Furthermore, a positive attitude can help individuals to overcome obstacles and challenges in the workplace, leading to greater job satisfaction and success.

falcon_180b_v1_661,"The debate over the legalization of marijuana has been a heated topic in recent years. Some argue that it should be legalized because of its medicinal benefits and potential to boost the economy, while others believe it should remain illegal due to its negative effects on mental health and potential for addiction. After conducting research and considering both sides of the argument, I have come to the conclusion that marijuana should be legalized.

Firstly, marijuana has been found to have numerous medicinal benefits. It can be used to alleviate symptoms of various illnesses, such as chronic pain, epilepsy, and anxiety. According to a report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, ""conclusive or substantial evidence"" exists to support the use of marijuana for chronic pain, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, and patient-reported symptom relief. Legalizing marijuana would allow more people to access these potential benefits without fear of legal repercussions.

Secondly, legalization could have a positive impact on the economy. States that have already legalized marijuana, such as Colorado and California, have seen significant increases in tax revenue and job creation. A report by New Frontier Data found that the legal cannabis market could create over 250,000 jobs by 2020. Additionally, legalization would reduce the amount of money spent on enforcing marijuana-related laws, allowing those resources to be redirected towards more pressing issues.

Despite these potential benefits, opponents of legalization argue that marijuana can have negative effects on mental health and lead to addiction. While it is true that excessive usage can lead to these issues, the same can be said for alcohol and tobacco – both of which are legal and regulated substances. Moreover, legalization would allow for better regulation and monitoring of usage, potentially reducing the risk of these negative effects.

In conclusion, the benefits of legalizing marijuana outweigh the potential risks. The medicinal benefits, potential economic boost, and ability for better regulation make a strong case for legalization. It is time for society to shift its perspective on marijuana and recognize its potential as a valuable resource.",1,0.9941043,1,True
6B479AF72202,"Ralph Waldo Emerson's statement, ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment"" is a powerful idea that can be applied in myriad contexts. It speaks to the idea that being true to one's self is a valuable and underrated task. Throughout life, there will be people and situations that try to change who you are, and there is great strength in resisting and staying true to oneself.

The first step to being oneself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is to recognize and accept one's own uniqueness. It is essential to understand that everyone is different - no one is exactly like anyone else, and no single individual possesses all the necessary skills and qualities in one package. Acknowledging and embracing this individuality can be both liberating and empowering. 

The next step is to devote time and energy to focusing on one's own needs and goals, rather than comparing oneself to others and attempting to constantly change oneself to keep up with their successes. Comparison is a pathway to unhappiness, because it distracts one's focus away from oneself. Instead, taking the time to set goals and develop long-term strategies to achieving them, regardless of external pressures and demands, is the most effective way to be oneself in a world that is trying to make you something else. Furthermore, by having an attainable plan to reach one's goals, one is less likely to be pulled away from achieving them.

In conclusion, it is clear that Ralph Waldo Emerson's statement, ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment"" is indeed true. Taking the time and effort to recognize and accept one's uniqueness, as well as focusing on one's own needs and goals, are two effective steps in achieving this greatest accomplishment.",1,0.9944247,1,True

llama_70b_v1272,"Position: Against the development of driverless cars

Introduction:
The development of driverless cars has been a topic of much debate in recent years. While some argue that they will bring about convenience and safety, I believe that the negative consequences outweigh the benefits. In this essay, I will argue against the development of driverless cars, using details from the article ""Driverless Cars are Coming"" to support my position.

Body:
One of the main concerns with driverless cars is their ability to make decisions in complex situations. The article states that driverless cars ""will have to confront a moral dilemma that human drivers often face: whether to prioritize the safety of the occupants or the safety of pedestrians and other road users"" (para. 12). This raises questions about the car's ability to make ethical decisions, and whether it will always prioritize the safety of its occupants over the safety of others. Additionally, the article mentions that driverless cars may not always be able to distinguish between different types of pedestrians, such as children and adults (para. 13). This could lead to situations where the car prioritizes the safety of one group over another, which could have devastating consequences.

Another concern is the potential for hacking and cyber attacks. The article notes that driverless cars ""will rely on a complex network of sensors, software, and connectivity"" (para. 8), which creates a large attack surface for hackers. This could allow hackers to gain control of the car and cause accidents, or even use the car as a weapon. The article also mentions that hackers could potentially manipulate the car's sensors to create false images or obscure real ones (para. 11), which could lead to accidents or other dangerous situations.

Furthermore, driverless cars may not be as safe as proponents claim. The article states that driverless cars ""will have to contend with the variability of human behavior"" (para. 10), which could lead to accidents or near-misses. Additionally, the article notes that driverless cars may not always be able to detect and respond to unexpected events, such as a child running into the road (para. 13). This could lead to accidents that could have been avoided if a human driver had been behind the wheel.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, while the development of driverless cars may offer some benefits, such as increased convenience and safety, I believe that the negative consequences outweigh these benefits. The potential for hacking and cyber attacks, the car's ability to make ethical decisions, and the potential for accidents due to the variability of human behavior and unexpected events all argue against the development of driverless cars. Therefore, I strongly disagree with the idea that driverless cars are the future of transportation.",1,0.9942667,1,True
7AF7DC456D3C,"As an eighth-grade student, I strongly believe that a program that pairs older students with younger ones for academic and recreational activities would be a great way to improve the academic performance of younger students. This program would not only provide academic support, but also foster a sense of community and mentorship among students of all ages.

One of the main benefits of this program is that older students can help younger students review their notes for important tests, such as the SOLs. This is a crucial aspect of academic success, as these tests can determine a student's grade and future opportunities. By having an older student to review their notes with, younger students can gain a better understanding of the material and feel more confident going into the test.

In addition to academic support, this program can also provide recreational activities for younger students to participate in. Board games, reading, and sports are all great ways to engage students and help them relax and have fun. These activities can also be a great way to build relationships and foster a sense of community among students.

Overall, I believe that this program would be a great way to improve the academic performance of younger students and foster a sense of community and mentorship among students of all ages.

Making important life decisions can be super tough, you know? Like, which college should I go to? Or what career path should I choose? It's not easy to make the right choice, especially when there are so many options to choose from. That's why it's important to seek advice from other people. But, should you get advice from one person or multiple people? That's the question.

Pros of seeking advice from one person:

* It's easier to focus on one person's opinion. When you're getting advice from one person, you can really focus on what they're saying and what they think. You don't have to worry about hearing conflicting opinions from multiple people.
* You can get more personalized advice. When you're getting advice from one person, they can really get to know you and your situation. They can give you advice that's tailored to you and your specific needs.

Cons of seeking advice from one person:

* You might miss out on other perspectives. When you're only getting advice from one person, you might be missing out on other perspectives that could be really helpful. It's important to hear from a variety of people to get a well-rounded view of the situation.
* You might be influenced by bias. One person's opinion might be biased towards something that's not actually the best choice for you. It's important to get advice from a variety of people to avoid being swayed by bias.

Pros of seeking advice from multiple people:

* You get a variety of perspectives. When you're getting advice from multiple people, you're getting a variety of perspectives on the situation. This can help you make a more informed decision because you're not relying on just one person's opinion.
* You can avoid bias. When you're getting advice from multiple people, you're less likely to be influenced by bias. You're getting a more well-rounded view of the situation, which can help you make a better decision.

12aae468,"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages, both for individuals and for society as a whole. In recent years, there has been a growing trend to separate suburban life from auto use, as part of a movement called ""smart planning."" This movement is gaining traction in both developed and developing countries, and the benefits are becoming increasingly evident.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to experts, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly decrease these emissions, helping to combat climate change and improve air quality.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to a healthier and more active lifestyle. When people rely less on cars, they are more likely to engage in physical activities such as walking or cycling. This not only improves individual health but also reduces traffic congestion and the need for expensive infrastructure like highways and parking lots. In Vauban, Germany, a car-free community, 70 percent of families do not own cars, and residents have reported feeling happier and more relaxed without the stress of car ownership.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of public transportation and alternative modes of transportation. In many car-free communities, public transportation is more accessible, and stores and services are located within walking or cycling distance. This reduces the reliance on cars for daily activities and encourages the use of more sustainable transportation options. In Bogota, Colombia, car-free days have been implemented to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. These events have been successful in encouraging millions of people to use buses, bicycles, or simply walk to work, resulting in reduced traffic congestion and improved air quality.

Moreover, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. By reducing the number of cars on the road, there is less need for road maintenance and the construction of new highways and parking lots. This frees up resources that can be used for other important purposes, such as public transportation improvements and the development of pedestrian-friendly infrastructure. Additionally, car-free communities often attract new businesses and residents, contributing to the local economy.

While the idea of limiting car usage may seem daunting, the shift is already happening. Studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. This shift in behavior, if it continues, can have significant positive implications for carbon emissions, the environment, and the overall well-being of individuals and communities. Governments and policymakers are increasingly recognizing this trend and taking steps to promote car-reduced communities and prioritize public transportation in their planning.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, promotion of a healthier lifestyle, and economic benefits. As more communities adopt smart planning principles and prioritize alternative modes of transportation, we can create a more sustainable and livable future for ourselves and future generations. It is time to rethink our reliance on cars and embrace a more balanced and sustainable approach to transportation.",1,0.9945209,1,True
E47A7E497F78,"It is often said that “no act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted.” At first this might seem like a trite old proverb with no real meaning, but when one considers the myriad of ways in which a simple act of kindness can impact a person's life, the importance of such an act becomes clear. 

Take the example of a student who is having a difficult time in completing a challenging assignment in school. Perhaps they are struggling to find the motivation to even begin the task, let alone complete it. Something as small as encouraging words from a teacher or classmate, or even from a stranger, about their potential to succeed can be incredibly positive and motivating in pushing them forward. This small act of kindness has the potential to encourage perseverance and even ignite their passion to succeed. 

Numerous studies have found that simple acts of social kindness and connection, such as eye contact or a simple hello when passing someone on the street, have a powerful effect on both the giver and the receiver. It can bring about an immediate feeling of warmth and connection, and can even spark more meaningful relationships in the future. People who feel seen and acknowledged are often more motivated to contribute positive value to their communities, which in turn creates a wider ripple effect of positivity. 

Ultimately, small acts of kindness can open us up to an entirely new world that is full of potential. It starts with one small gesture.

On the other hand, enthusiasm is essential for success because it drives individuals to pursue their goals with passion and determination. In this essay, I will discuss how failure plays an important role in the pursuit of success and why enthusiasm is necessary for success.

Firstly, failure is an important part of the learning process. It allows individuals to identify areas where they need to improve and provides them with the opportunity to learn from their mistakes. For example, when learning to ride a bike, it is inevitable that one will fall off at some point. However, instead of giving up, individuals should use this experience as an opportunity to learn how to balance and steer their bike better. By learning from failure, individuals can improve their skills and increase their chances of success in the future.

Secondly, enthusiasm is necessary for success because it drives individuals to pursue their goals with passion and determination. Without enthusiasm, individuals may give up easily when faced with challenges or setbacks. For example, when starting a new project, individuals may feel overwhelmed and unsure of their abilities. However, if they are enthusiastic about the project and believe in their ability to succeed, they are more likely to persevere through challenges and achieve their goals.

In conclusion, failure and enthusiasm play important roles in the pursuit of success. Failure provides valuable lessons that can help individuals grow and improve, while enthusiasm drives individuals to pursue their goals with passion and determination. By embracing failure and maintaining enthusiasm, individuals can increase their chances of achieving success in their personal and professional lives.",1,0.99415034,1,True
falcon_180b_v1_772,"Title: The Martian ""Face"" - A Natural Formation or Alien Artifact?

Introduction:

The topic of extraterrestrial life has fascinated humanity for centuries, leading to countless speculations and theories. One such theory revolves around the famous ""Face on Mars,"" which has sparked debates and controversies since its discovery in 1976. However, after thorough analysis and research, it is evident that the ""face"" is not an alien artifact but rather a natural landform. This essay will argue against the belief that the Face on Mars was created by aliens, using claims supported by evidence from the article 'Unmasking the Face on Mars.'

Body:

Firstly, the idea that the Face on Mars was sculpted by intelligent beings stems from pareidolia, a psychological phenomenon where the brain perceives familiar patterns or shapes in random data. In this case, the human mind tends to see a face due to our innate tendency to recognize faces. According to Dr. Michael Malin, a geologist at San Diego State University, ""...the human brain is wired to look for faces."" Furthermore, he explains that the Martian ""face"" lacks distinct facial features when viewed at higher resolutions, suggesting it is merely a trick of light and shadow playing on a mesa.

Secondly, the notion that the Face is an artificial structure defies logical reasoning. If we assume that aliens did indeed carve this feature, why would they choose to create a monument resembling a human face? It seems far more likely that any advanced civilization capable of interplanetary travel and terraforming would leave more definitive evidence of their existence. Additionally, the size of the ""face,"" approximately 1.5 miles across, would require an enormous amount of resources and labor, raising questions about the practicality of such an endeavor.

Lastly, recent missions to Mars, including the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, have provided high-resolution images of the Cydonia region where the ""face"" is located. These images reveal that the supposed ""face"" is merely a mesa with natural formations mimicking facial features. Vincent DiPietro, a computer scientist who worked on the Viking mission, analyzed these new images and concluded, ""It looks like a normal mesa with erosion and landslides.""

Conclusion:

In conclusion, the belief that the Face on Mars is an alien artifact stems from pareidolia and lacks substantial evidence",1,0.9901461,1,True
BB5D6C14712D,"Failure: The Stepping Stone to Success

As an 8th grader, I have learned that failure is not the end of the world. In fact, it can be a crucial stepping stone towards success. Many successful people have achieved their goals not despite their failures, but because of them. Thomas Edison, the inventor of the light bulb, is famously quoted as saying, ""I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."" Failure is a natural part of the learning process, and it can teach us valuable lessons that help us grow and improve.

One example of an individual who succeeded due to failure is J.K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter series. Rowling was rejected by 12 publishers before one finally agreed to publish her book. If she had given up after the first rejection, we might never have known the magic of Hogwarts. Her persistence and determination paid off, and her books have gone on to become a global phenomenon.

Another example of failure leading to success is the story of Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple. Jobs was fired from the company he founded, but he used that experience to refine his ideas and come back stronger than ever. His second time around, he revolutionized the tech industry with innovative products like the iPhone and iPad.

One example of a failure that led to success that I find particularly interesting is the story of Colonel Harland Sanders, the founder of Kentucky Fried Chicken. Sanders spent years trying to sell his fried chicken recipe to restaurants, but he was rejected over 1,000 times. Finally, he franchised his recipe and opened the first KFC restaurant. Today, KFC is one of the most recognizable fast-food chains in the world.

Achieving power, freedom, and respect are closely linked to success. When we fail, we often feel a loss of power and control. However, by learning from our failures and persevering, we can gain back that power and achieve our goals. Freedom to pursue our passions and dreams is also essential to success. When we are free to fail, we are free to try again and keep trying until we succeed",1,0.9939658,1,True

I talked to a close friend who was very passionate about theater and I could see that they wanted to encourage me to audition, but I couldn't work up the courage to actually do it. 

I believe the reason I was unsuccessful with participating in the school theater productions was because I was afraid of failure and I didn't have enough confidence in my own abilities. My lack of self-confidence kept me from taking action and kept me from fulfilling a potential passion. If I had pushed myself to step outside my comfort zone, I believe I could have achieved success.

If I had made a different decision two years ago and taken the risk of auditioning, it is possible that I could have gained a greater understanding of theater and my own skillset.

It's like, if you don't try new things and take risks, you'll never know if you could've done them. And if you don't learn from your mistakes, you'll keep doing the same things over and over again.  It's like, boring.

80DD7EE85BF7,"Sure, here is an essay arguing against adding one and a half hours to school days from the perspective of an average 8th grade student:

Introduction:

Hey, guys, have you heard the latest? Our school is thinking about adding an extra hour and a half to our school days! I know, I know, it sounds like a lot, but trust me, it's not worth it. I'm here to tell you why.

Reason 1: We're already in school for 8 hours and it's too much.

Like, come on, 8 hours is already a long time to be cooped up in a classroom. I mean, sure, we learn stuff and all, but we also need time to relax and have some fun. Adding more time to our days would just mean we'd be stuck in school even longer. And let's be real, who wants to be in school that long? It's not like we're going to learn anything new or important in that extra time.

Reason 2: We don't have enough time for personal activities.

I know some people might be like, ""But we need more time to learn stuff!"" And yeah, I get that, but we also need time to do our own things. Like, I love playing soccer, but if we have more school time, I won't be able to practice as much. And it's not just me, it's all of us. We all have our own things we want to do, whether it's playing music or hanging out with friends. If we have more school time, we'll just have less time for those things.

Homework is already a total drag, and adding more time to our days means we'll just have more homework to do. Like, I get it, homework helps us learn stuff, but come on, we can't handle any more. It's like, if we're already spending 8 hours in school, the last thing we want to do is come home and do more work. It's just not fair.

So, I know it's not exactly the coolest thing to do, but I think elementary schoolers should have to do community service. I mean, think about it, we're basically just sitting around all day, learning stuff and stuff. It's not like we're actually contributing to society or anything. But, if we did community service, we could be helping people and making a difference! 

First of all, community service can teach us important life skills like responsibility and empathy. Like, if we're helping out at a soup kitchen, we're not just sitting there playing games on our phones. We're actually helping people who are hungry and don't have enough food. And, if we're cleaning up a park, we're not just messing around, we're actually making the place cleaner and nicer for everyone. 

And, it's not like it has to take up a lot of time. Like, we could do it during recess or something. I mean, I know we have a lot of fun during recess, but think about how much more fun it would be if we were doing something good for the community instead of just playing tag. 

Plus, it can be really rewarding. Like, I heard about this one kid who did a community service project where he made blankets for homeless people. And, he was so happy and proud of himself when he finished. It was like, wow, he made a real difference in someone's life. 

So, yeah, I think elementary schoolers should totally have to do community service. It's not only good for us, but it's good for the community too. And, who knows, maybe one day we'll be the ones making the rules and we can make sure that community service is a requirement for everyone!

Having an outside source to help make choices can often lead to more successful outcomes, as they are often experienced professionals who can offer valuable, unbiased advice. For example, seeking guidance from a financial advisor when making major investment decisions can help to ensure the decisions are informed by the current market conditions, and will ultimately result in a much more profitable return on the investment. Similarly, when considering major career changes, a school or university career advisor can help identify the most beneficial courses to take and the most advantageous job prospects available to an individual. 

Further, a mentor or life coach can be incredibly helpful when it comes to personal growth. By cultivating an open relationship with someone who has more experience, people can gain the insight and advice they need when navigating personal challenges, and make more sound and holistic decisions as they evaluate professional and personal options.

When it comes to life's important decisions, having the right guidance can be a game changer.

B3493FBE6476,"Distance learning has become increasingly popular in recent years, and for good reason. With the rise of technology and the need for flexibility in education, distance learning provides students with the opportunity to attend classes from the comfort of their own home. This option has many benefits, including increased motivation and convenience for students and parents alike.

One of the main reasons why distance learning is a great option for students is that it can help increase motivation. Many students struggle with motivation in traditional classroom settings, often due to the distractions and pressure of the physical school environment. With distance learning, students can attend classes from the comfort of their own home, free from the distractions of the classroom and the pressure to perform. This can lead to increased focus and motivation, as students are able to create a study environment that works best for them.

Another benefit of distance learning is the convenience it provides for students and parents. With distance learning, students can attend classes from the comfort of their own home, without having to worry about commuting or finding a place to study. This can save time and money, and make it easier for students to balance their studies with other responsibilities, such as work or family.

While there may be negative reactions to offering distance learning from parents, it is important to consider the benefits it provides for students. Distance learning can help increase motivation, provide convenience, and give students the same information as they would attending a physical school. With the rise of technology and the need for flexibility in education, distance learning is a great option for students to attend classes from the comfort of their own home.

In conclusion, distance learning is a great option for students to attend classes from home. It can help increase motivation, provide convenience, and give students the same information as they would attending a physical school.

falcon_180b_v1_198,"""Distance learning,"" as defined by Merriam-Webster, is ""education imparted remotely via technological means."" With the rise in technology, some schools are now offering this type of learning experience as an option for students to attend classes. As a student in grade 11, I believe that attending classes from home would be incredibly beneficial.

First, attending classes from home would offer students a greater level of flexibility. For example, if a student needs to attend a doctor's appointment, they can easily do so without worrying about missing a day of school. They can make up the work later at their own pace. Students who live in rural areas and have long commutes to school would also benefit from distance learning.

Additionally, students who have learning disabilities or are struggling academically would benefit greatly from being able to attend classes from home. They may feel more comfortable asking questions or seeking help in a one-on-one video conference with their teachers. Students who are easily embarrassed or shy in a classroom setting can feel at ease knowing that they aren't in front of a large group of peers.

However, there are potential drawbacks to distance learning. Some students may be more easily distracted when they are attending classes from home. It may be difficult to remain focused without the traditional structure of a classroom. Additionally, some students may miss the social interaction that comes with attending school. 

In conclusion, I believe that offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes would be beneficial for both students and teachers. While there are potential drawbacks, the advantages of greater flexibility and individualized learning opportunities far outweigh the potential disadvantages.""",1,0.9940329,1,True
7CDB47E88B39,"Dear Professor,

I am writing to discuss the idea of having a longer winter break due to severe snowstorms, a shorter summer break, and a one-week break in the fall and spring. While it may seem like a good idea to have more breaks throughout the year, I believe that regular summer, winter, and spring breaks are a better idea. In this essay, I will evaluate the pros and cons of each and argue why regular breaks are the best option.

Firstly, having a longer winter break due to severe snowstorms would have several disadvantages. Firstly, it would disrupt the school year, causing students to fall behind in their studies. With a longer break, students would have to catch up on missed work, which could be challenging and time-consuming. Additionally, it would be difficult for teachers to plan and prepare for the new semester, as they would have to adjust their lesson plans and materials to accommodate the students' needs.

Secondly, having a shorter summer break would also have its drawbacks. While it may seem like a good idea to have more breaks throughout the year, a shorter summer break would not give students enough time to relax and recharge. Students need time to unwind and spend time with their families and friends. A shorter summer break would not allow for this, and students would likely feel overwhelmed and stressed when they returned to school in the fall.

Finally, having a one-week break in the fall and spring would not be beneficial for several reasons. Firstly, it would disrupt the school year and cause students to fall behind in their studies. Secondly, it would be difficult for teachers to plan and prepare for the new semester, as they would have to adjust their lesson plans and materials to accommodate the students' needs.

In conclusion, regular summer, winter, and spring breaks are the best option for several reasons. Firstly, they allow students to relax and recharge, which is essential for their mental and physical well-being. Secondly, they do not disrupt the school year and allow teachers to plan and prepare for the new semester. Therefore, I believe that regular breaks are the best option and should be maintained.

So, like, a 10 p.m. weekday and midnight weekend curfew for teenagers?  That's, like, a pretty big deal, you know? I mean, it's not every day you get to analyze something that affects your freedom, safety, and well-being .

Okay, so let's start with the freedom part.  A curfew can seriously limit our ability to go out and do stuff after a certain time. I mean, think about it. You can't just go to the mall, hang out with friends, or even go to the movies without getting permission from your parents.  It's like, they're trying to control our every move!  And let's be real, sometimes we just want to have some alone time or go to bed whenever we feel like it. 

But, like, safety is also a big thing to consider.  I mean, it's not cool to be out and about after dark, especially if you're not with a group of people.  There are, like, crazy people and stuff out there, and you don't want to be the only one walking around by yourself.  Plus, accidents can happen, and it's way better to be inside with your parents than out on the streets. 

And, oh man, parental trust and respect!  I mean, let's be real, sometimes our parents can be, like, super annoying and stuff.  But, like, if we're out after curfew, they're gonna be all over us like a bad rash.  It's like, they don't trust us at all, and it's really frustrating.

9C3D2911E32D,"As a teenage student, I believe that curfews are beneficial for a variety of reasons. First and foremost, curfews can help increase safety for teenagers. When teenagers are out late at night, they are more likely to be exposed to dangerous situations, such as being in the wrong place at the wrong time or being targeted by bullies or predators. By setting a curfew, parents can ensure that their children are home before the risk of danger increases.

Secondly, curfews can help build better relationships with family. By setting a curfew, parents can establish trust with their children and show that they care about their safety. This can help to strengthen the bond between parent and child, as well as promote open communication and mutual respect. Additionally, curfews can help to establish a sense of responsibility and accountability for teenagers, as they will need to plan their activities around the time they need to be home.

Overall, I believe that curfews are a beneficial tool for parents to help their teenage children stay safe and build better relationships with their families. While it may be difficult for some teenagers to follow a curfew, it is important for parents to communicate clearly and consistently about the importance of safety and responsibility. By working together, parents and teenagers can establish a curfew that works for both parties and promotes a safe and healthy lifestyle.",1,0.9945287,1,True

Making Your Own Decisions: The Key to Learning and Growth

As an 8th grader, I've realized that making your own decisions is super important. It's easy to get caught up in what adults say and do, but sometimes they don't know what's best for us. They might give us advice, but it's not always right for our situation. That's why it's important to make our own decisions and learn from our mistakes.

First of all, when we make our own decisions, we learn how to think critically. We have to weigh the pros and cons and make a choice based on what we think is best. This helps us develop problem-solving skills and become more independent. It's like practicing a muscle - the more we use it, the stronger it gets.

Another reason why making our own decisions is important is that it helps us build confidence. When we make a decision and it turns out good, we feel proud of ourselves. It's like, ""Hey, I did that! I made a good choice!"" And when we make a mistake, we can learn from it and do better next time. It's not like, ""Oh no, what will my parents think?"" or ""What will my friends think?"" We can just be like, ""Okay, that didn't work out. Let me try again.""

Also, when we make our own decisions, we learn how to take responsibility. We have to be accountable for our actions and their consequences. It's not like, ""Oh, someone else made the decision for me, so I don't have to worry about it."" We have to think about how our choices will affect ourselves and others. It's like, ""Okay, I made this decision, so I better make sure it turns out good.""

Finally, making our own decisions helps us figure out who we are and what we want. When we're always relying on adults for advice, we might not have a clear idea of what we want. But when we start making our own decisions, we start to figure it out. It's like, ""Oh, I like doing this. I don't like doing that",1,0.99436826,1,True
falcon_180b_v1_660,"I believe that dress codes are beneficial to the school environment. There are several reasons why I take this position. 

Firstly, dress codes help to promote a sense of equality and fairness among students. When all students are required to adhere to the same dress code, it eliminates the pressure to wear expensive or trendy clothing. This means that students from different socioeconomic backgrounds are less likely to feel excluded or marginalized based on their clothing choices.

Secondly, dress codes can help to reduce distractions in the classroom. When students are dressed appropriately for school, they are less likely to be preoccupied with how they look or what they are wearing. This can help them to focus on their studies and be more productive in class.

Lastly, dress codes can instill a sense of discipline and professionalism among students. By requiring students to dress in a particular way, it sends a message that school is a place for learning and that students should take their education seriously.

For example, when our school implemented a dress code last year, we noticed a significant improvement in the overall behavior and attitudes of our students. Fewer distractions, improved focus, and a more professional attitude created a more positive learning environment for everyone.

In conclusion, while some students may not like the idea of a dress code, I believe that the benefits far outweigh any potential drawbacks. By promoting equality, reducing distractions, and instilling discipline, dress codes can be an effective tool for creating a positive learning environment in schools.",1,0.99449724,1,True
A42A8E5FA4CD,"Being independent is a crucial aspect of personal growth and development. It is a state of being where a person is able to think and act for themselves, without relying on others for guidance or support. This process of becoming independent is often a gradual one, as individuals learn to trust their own judgment and make decisions based on their own values and beliefs. In this essay, I will analyze how people become independent by being themselves and the impact it has on their decisions. I will also discuss the advantages and disadvantages of being individual versus depending on someone else, using examples to support my argument.

One of the key ways that people become independent is by learning to trust their own judgment. This can be a challenging process, as it requires individuals to step out of their comfort zones and take risks. For example, when making a decision about a new job opportunity, an individual may initially be hesitant to take the risk and leave the safety and security of their current job. However, as they gain more experience and confidence in their own abilities, they may become more willing to take a chance and pursue their goals, even if it means stepping outside of their comfort zone.

Another way that people become independent is by developing their own values and beliefs. This can involve questioning the beliefs and values that they were raised with and seeking out new perspectives and ideas. For example, a person may have grown up in a conservative family and believed that certain social and political views were the only acceptable ones. However, as they grow older and encounter people with different beliefs and values, they may begin to question their own assumptions and develop their own unique perspective.

Being independent has both advantages and disadvantages. One advantage is that it allows individuals to make decisions based on their own values and beliefs, rather than relying on others to make decisions for them. This can lead to greater personal fulfillment and a sense of autonomy. For example, a person who is independent may be more likely to pursue their passions and interests, even if it means going against the expectations of their family or peers.

However, being independent can also have disadvantages. For example, it can be isolating and lonely, as individuals may struggle to find others who share their values and beliefs. It can also be challenging to navigate complex situations when making decisions on one's own, as individuals may lack the guidance and support of others.

He also reminds us to take solace in our resilience, and not allow a momentary setback to become permanent. After all, failure can be a valuable teacher, as it encourages us to critically analyze our mistakes and be more conscious and considerate when approaching similar tasks in the future.

falcon_180b_v1_632,"I firmly believe that despite the proliferation of digital resources, libraries remain a crucial institution in our communities. This conviction is based on several key reasons: first, libraries continue to provide access to physical books and other materials that many individuals might not otherwise have the means to acquire; second, they offer a quiet, dedicated space for study and research; and finally, libraries often act as community hubs, facilitating access to important resources and fostering social connections. In this essay, I will explore each of these points in greater detail.

To begin with, it is important to recognize that not everyone has equal access to digital resources. While it may be true that many books and articles can now be found online, there are still numerous barriers that prevent some individuals from taking advantage of these offerings. For example, those without reliable internet access at home may struggle to complete assignments or conduct research outside of school or work hours. Moreover, many academic journals and other specialized resources remain locked behind paywalls, making them inaccessible to those who cannot afford expensive subscriptions. Libraries serve as an important equalizer in this regard, providing free access to a wide range of materials for all members of the community.

In addition to offering physical resources, libraries also provide a unique environment conducive to study and concentration. For students in particular, libraries often offer a much-needed refuge from the distractions of home or dorm life. The quiet atmosphere and abundance of desk space allow for focused work, while the presence of reference materials and knowledgeable staff members can be invaluable when tackling challenging assignments. Furthermore, by bringing together individuals engaged in various forms of intellectual pursuits, libraries help to foster a sense of academic community that can be difficult to replicate elsewhere.

Finally, libraries play an essential role in connecting residents with important resources and services beyond their collections. For instance, many libraries offer job search assistance, resume workshops, and other forms of career development support. Others host events such as author talks, book clubs, and educational workshops on topics ranging from financial literacy to digital skills. In this way, libraries act as hubs for information and resources that might otherwise be difficult for individuals to access or navigate on their own.

Of course, some may argue that the rise of digital technologies has rendered libraries obsolete. After all, why bother visiting a physical building when so much information can be found with just a few clicks? While there is certainly some truth to this perspective, I would contend that it overlooks the many unique benefits that libraries provide. As outlined",1,0.9946163,1,True
A87C80DEAB08,"As an 8th grader, I believe that seeking guidance from experts and authorities can greatly improve one's life. Whether it's in academics, personal relationships, or career development, seeking help from those with more knowledge and experience can lead to greater success and fulfillment. In this essay, I will analyze the ways that seeking guidance can help people live an easier and more fulfilled life, using two personal stories to support my argument.

Firstly, seeking guidance from experts can help individuals achieve their goals and dreams. For example, in my own life, I have always struggled with math. Despite my best efforts, I found myself struggling to understand the concepts and apply them to problems. However, after seeking guidance from a tutor, I was able to improve my grades and gain a better understanding of the subject. This improved my confidence and allowed me to pursue my dream of becoming an engineer.

Similarly, my family member, my grandmother, faced many challenges in her life due to language barriers and cultural differences. However, she sought guidance from a language teacher and was able to improve her English skills, allowing her to pursue opportunities and live a more fulfilling life.

Secondly, seeking guidance from experts can also help individuals navigate the complexities of life and make better decisions. For instance, my grandfather faced a difficult decision when he was diagnosed with a serious illness. He sought guidance from a medical professional and was able to make an informed decision about his treatment, ultimately leading to a better outcome.

Furthermore, seeking guidance from authorities can help individuals avoid costly mistakes and make the most of their resources. For example, my parents sought guidance from a financial advisor when planning for their retirement. With their help, they were able to create a sound financial plan and avoid costly mistakes, ensuring a comfortable retirement.

In conclusion, seeking guidance from experts and authorities can greatly improve one's life. Whether it's achieving goals, making better decisions, or avoiding costly mistakes, seeking help from those with more knowledge and experience can lead to greater success and fulfillment. As demonstrated by my own personal experiences and those of my family members, seeking guidance can be a valuable tool in navigating the complexities of life.",1,0.99459803,1,True

According to the passages, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage and promoting alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, and public transit, these emissions can be significantly reduced.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of smart planning and compact suburbs. The passages mention the German suburb of Vauban, where car ownership is allowed but parking is limited, resulting in 70 percent of families not owning cars. Similar concepts are being adopted around the world to make suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation. This approach involves placing stores within walking distance and reducing the reliance on car-centric development. By doing so, communities become more walkable, promote healthier lifestyles, and reduce the need for car travel.

Limiting car usage also has positive impacts on air quality. The passage about Paris reveals that a partial driving ban was enforced to clear the air of smog. This resulted in a 60 percent reduction in congestion and improved air quality. The ban targeted vehicles with even-numbered or odd-numbered license plates on different days. By limiting car usage during periods of high pollution, cities can improve air quality and reduce health risks associated with pollution.

Additionally, promoting alternative transportation options can lead to reduced stress for individuals. The residents of Vauban, Germany, mentioned in one of the passages, expressed their happiness and reduced tension after giving up their cars. By relying on alternative modes of transportation, such as walking and cycling, individuals can experience a more active and stress-free lifestyle.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can have positive economic impacts. The passage about Bogota, Colombia, mentions a car-free day program aimed at promoting alternative transportation and reducing smog. Such programs can ease traffic congestion, lower infrastructure costs, and improve access to public transportation. This can result in improved economic productivity and reduced expenses for individuals and governments.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has several advantages, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, the promotion of smart planning, improved air quality, reduced stress, and positive economic impacts. By encouraging alternative modes of transportation and adopting car-free initiatives, communities can create a more sustainable and enjoyable living environment.",1,0.9927585,1,True

Hey there, Mrs. Johnson! 

For our assignment, I researched different types of instruments, their sounds, and playing techniques. I found out that there are four main types of instruments: strings, woodwinds, brass, and percussion. Each type has its unique sound and playing style. For example, strings produce a mellow and rich sound, while woodwinds have a bright and airy sound. Brass instruments have a deep and powerful sound, and percussion instruments are the most versatile.

Next, I brainstormed potential science fair projects related to music. I came up with five ideas:

1. Creating a new type of reed for woodwind instruments
2. Developing a digital instrument that can mimic the sound of any instrument
3. Exploring the relationship between music and brain function
4. Building a wind turbine that generates sound waves
5. Creating a device that can convert vibrations into sound

After researching each project, I decided that the most suitable one for me is the second one – developing a digital instrument that can mimic the sound of any instrument. I think it would be really cool to create something that can produce any sound imaginable!

In addition to the science fair project, I also decided to learn about the works of William Shakespeare and select a play to act. I chose ""Romeo and Juliet"" because it's a classic and I think it would be a lot of fun to perform. I'm going to create a costume for my role as Romeo, and practice playing the instrument (a guitar) and preparing for the performance.

So, you know how people say that technology is taking over our lives? Yeah, well, I think they're wrong. Like, totally wrong. I mean, sure, technology can be a distraction sometimes, but it's also super helpful in so many ways.

First of all, technology can help us find new jobs. Like, my dad's a freelance graphic designer, and he uses his computer and stuff to make websites and stuff for clients. And my mom's a writer, and she uses her computer to write articles and books. Without technology, they wouldn't be able to do their jobs!

And technology can also help us meet new people. Like, I've made so many friends on social media. I mean, sure, some of them are probably fake, but some of them are real too! And we can talk to them and share stuff and stuff. It's like having a whole new group of friends!

And lastly, technology can help us communicate with others. Like, my grandma lives in Florida, and she's like, really old, so she can't talk to people in person very well. But she can use her computer and stuff to talk to us on Facetime and stuff. It's like, super helpful!

Okay, so there are some real-life examples from my essay to support my analysis. Like, my dad's freelance graphic design business wouldn't be possible without technology, and my mom's writing career wouldn't be possible without technology either. And I've made so many friends on social media that I probably wouldn't have met in real life. And my grandma can talk to us on Facetime even though she's really old and can't talk to people in person very well.

So yeah, technology is super helpful and it's not taking over our lives like some people say it is. It's just making things easier and helping us do new things that we couldn't do before. Like, I'm pretty sure that without technology, I wouldn't be able to write this essay right now!

On the other hand, allowing students to use their cell phones has potential risks, including the possibility of students becoming distracted from the lesson or using the devices to cheat on tests and assignments.

Even though cell phones can be powerful learning tools, providing access to a range of educational resources, it is important to examine the potential impact of allowing students to use them in the classroom on their learning. For example, if a student frequently uses their cell phone during class, they may miss important information or become distracted during lecture. Furthermore, students might use their cell phones to access inappropriate content such as games, messages, or memes.

Determination, encouragement, enthusiasm, and hard work are essential components of achieving success in life, as exemplified by the spider that kept trying to reach its goal.

Determination is the driving force behind success. It is the ability to keep pushing forward even when faced with obstacles and setbacks. The spider in our example never gave up, even when it failed multiple times. Instead, it continued to try and try again until it finally succeeded. Determination is not just about pushing through the tough times, but also about believing in oneself and having the confidence to keep going.

Encouragement is another important factor in achieving success. It is the support and motivation that comes from others, whether it be friends, family, or mentors. The spider in our example likely received encouragement from other spiders or insects that it encountered on its journey. This encouragement gave it the strength to keep going and to believe that it could succeed. Encouragement is not just about cheering someone on, but also about providing guidance and advice to help them achieve their goals.

Enthusiasm is the passion and excitement that drives individuals towards their goals. It is the energy and motivation that comes from having a clear vision of what one wants to achieve. The spider in our example was likely filled with enthusiasm as it worked towards its goal. This enthusiasm helped to fuel its determination and hard work, and ultimately led to its success. Enthusiasm is not just about being passionate about a goal, but also about having the drive to turn that passion into action.

Hard work is the final piece of the puzzle when it comes to achieving success. It is the effort and dedication that is required to turn a goal into a reality. The spider in our example spent countless hours spinning its web, trying to reach its goal. This hard work ultimately paid off, as it was able to catch its prey and succeed.

9B23FE314CF5,"Hey there!  So, I guess you want me to write about how behavior can influence other people and the consequences of modeling bad behavior to kids. 

First of all, let's talk about how our actions can affect others. Like, if we're always late to class, our friends might start to think it's okay to be late too. Or, if we're mean to our siblings, they might start treating others poorly as well. It's like, we're setting an example for them, you know? And if we're not careful, they might just follow in our footsteps. 

But, oh man, the potential consequences of modeling bad behavior to kids are serious!  If they grow up thinking it's okay to be rude or disrespectful, they might have a hard time making friends or even getting a job someday. And let's not forget about the long-term effects of having a bad record.  Imagine trying to travel abroad with a criminal record. It's like, good luck getting into any country!  ""Sorry, you can't enter our country because you were mean to your little brother once."" 

So, it's super important that we teach kids good behavior. Like, we need to show them how to be kind and respectful to others, even when no one is watching. And it's not just about being good, it's about being responsible. If we teach them to take responsibility for their actions, they'll be more likely to make good choices in the future. 

But here's the thing, educating kids on good behavior isn't just about them, it's about the entire society.  If we can raise a generation of kind and responsible kids, we can create a better world!

fa684f16,"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can provide numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. Implementing measures that promote alternative modes of transportation and reduce reliance on cars can have a significant impact on greenhouse gas emissions, traffic congestion, and public health. Several examples from around the world illustrate the benefits of limiting car usage.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a major contributor to these emissions, with passenger cars responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and even up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States (Rosenthal, 2009). By encouraging people to use alternative modes of transportation, such as public transport, walking, or cycling, we can decrease our emissions and combat climate change.

Another advantage is the reduction of traffic congestion. In many cities, especially in suburban areas, heavy car usage leads to excessive traffic, which not only wastes time but also contributes to pollution and accidents. In Vauban, Germany, a car-free suburb, only two places to park are available, resulting in 70 percent of families not owning cars (Rosenthal, 2009). This low-car suburban life model promotes public transportation and reduces the need for parking spaces, ultimately leading to less congestion on the roads.

Limiting car usage also has positive health effects. Cars are a significant source of air pollution, with diesel fuel being a major culprit (Duffer, 2014). By decreasing car usage, we can improve air quality and, consequently, public health. Furthermore, promoting alternative modes of transportation like walking or cycling can also encourage physical activity, leading to improved overall well-being and a reduction in obesity rates.

Moreover, limiting car usage can promote more sustainable and compact development. Traditional suburban developments, with spread-out homes and private garages, have long been the norm. However, new approaches like the Vauban model advocate for more walkable communities with stores located nearby rather than in distant malls (Rosenthal, 2009). This smart planning not only reduces the need for long car trips but also creates vibrant and accessible neighborhoods.

In Bogota, Colombia, an annual car-free day has become a great success, with millions of Colombians using alternative transportation methods (Selsky, 2002). This event showcases the potential for change and demonstrates that cities can function without the heavy dependence on cars. Furthermore, initiatives like bike-sharing programs and car-sharing services contribute to the overall goal of limiting car usage and promoting sustainable transportation options (Rosenthal, 2013).

In conclusion, there are several advantages to limiting car usage. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, alleviating traffic congestion, improving public health, and promoting sustainable development, we can create more livable and environmentally friendly communities. Examples from around the world demonstrate that alternative modes of transportation can be successful, and it is crucial for individuals and policymakers to embrace these changes for a sustainable future.",1,0.9935436,1,True

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my position on the matter of the Electoral College and its continued existence or potential replacement by a popular vote for the President of the United States. After carefully considering the arguments presented in various texts, I firmly believe that the Electoral College should be retained. In this letter, I will present my claim, address counterclaims, provide evidence from multiple sources, and avoid over-reliance on a single source.

The Electoral College, as established by the founding fathers, serves as a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and a popular vote of qualified citizens. It consists of the selection of electors, the voting process by electors for the President and Vice President, and the counting of electoral votes by Congress. Each state's allotment of electors is based on its Congressional delegation, ensuring fair representation (Passage 1).

One counterclaim against the Electoral College is that it is undemocratic. However, it is essential to note that democracy does not always mean direct popular vote but can also include representative democracy. The electors, selected by the political parties, have a responsibility to vote for their party's nominee, ensuring that the will of the people is represented (Passage 15).

The first reason to retain the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. Unlike in a direct popular vote system, disputes over the electoral vote outcome are considerably less likely due to the winner-take-all allocation of electoral votes in most states (Passage 18). This ensures a decisive result and reduces the possibility of extensive recounts or legal challenges, as seen in the 2000 election.

The Electoral College also serves as a means to ensure that the President has trans-regional appeal (Passage 19). No single region in the country possesses enough electoral votes to elect a President, thereby compelling candidates to campaign in various states across different regions. This requirement promotes a broader understanding of regional interests and prevents the disenfranchisement that would occur if a candidate campaigned only in the regions where they were already popular.

Furthermore, the Electoral College focuses campaign efforts on swing states, where the election outcome is uncertain (Passage 20). By prioritizing these states, candidates must engage voters who are most likely to pay close attention to the campaign and make informed decisions. This ensures that the most thoughtful voters, who have received the most information and attention from the candidates, have the final say in the election.

The Electoral College also restores some balance to the political influence of large states compared to small states (Passage 21). While the popular vote would allow candidates to focus solely on large population centers, the Electoral College system forces candidates to consider the concerns of smaller states and gives them disproportionately more attention in the campaign process. This ensures that the interests of citizens living in less populated states are not ignored.

Lastly, the Electoral College addresses the issue of run-off elections by consistently producing a clear winner (Passage 22). This eliminates the need for the complexities and expenses associated with additional voting rounds. Through this system, the President who garners the most electoral votes is declared the winner, ensuring a decisive outcome.

In conclusion, the arguments in favor of retaining the Electoral College, including certainty of outcome, trans-regional appeal, swing states, balancing the political influence, and avoiding run-off elections, outweigh the counterarguments. The Electoral College provides a fair representation of voters' needs and interests while maintaining the stability and integrity of the presidential election process. It ensures that all states have a voice and that regions with diverse interests are considered.

Thank you for considering my viewpoint on this important matter. I trust that you will take into account the practical reasons supporting the retention of the Electoral College. If you have any further questions or require additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

The American Revolution was a pivotal moment in the history of the world. It was a time when a group of brave men and women stood up against the tyranny of the British Empire and fought for their rights and freedoms. The founding fathers of the United States, including Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, played a crucial role in the success of the revolution.

Thomas Jefferson and John Adams were both deeply influenced by their experiences during the American Revolution. They saw firsthand the injustices and oppressions that the British Empire inflicted upon the colonists. This experience shaped their beliefs and motivated them to fight for a new nation that would be based on the principles of freedom and justice.

Thomas Jefferson's writing was a powerful tool in the fight for independence. He wrote extensively about the injustices of the British Empire and the need for a new nation that would be based on the principles of liberty and equality. He spoke passionately about the importance of individual rights and the dangers of a government that seeks to control every aspect of its citizens' lives.

One of Jefferson's most famous quotes is ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal."" This quote encapsulates the essence of the American Revolution and the ideals upon which the United States was founded. It shows that Jefferson believed in the inherent worth and dignity of every human being, regardless of their social status or background.

Jefferson's influence on the American Revolution cannot be overstated. He was a key figure in drafting the Declaration of Independence, which served as the formal announcement of the colonies' intention to break away from British rule. He also played a critical role in organizing the Continental Army and served as the Secretary of State under President George Washington.

In conclusion, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams were deeply influenced by their experiences during the American Revolution. They fought for a new nation that would be based on the principles of freedom and justice. Jefferson's writing and passion for individual rights were instrumental in the success of the revolution.

Making decisions on our own allows for active decision-making, which is crucial for personal growth and development. In this essay, I will discuss two reasons why people should make their own decisions and evaluate the benefits of being confident in the decisions that we make.

Firstly, making decisions on our own allows us to take responsibility for our choices. When we make our own decisions, we are accountable for the outcomes of those decisions. This means that we learn from our mistakes and grow as individuals. By taking responsibility for our choices, we develop a sense of ownership and pride in our decisions. This sense of ownership can lead to greater satisfaction and fulfillment in life.

Secondly, making decisions on our own allows us to express our individuality. When we make our own decisions, we are able to choose what is important to us and what aligns with our values and beliefs. This means that we are able to express our unique identity and stand out from the crowd. By making decisions that reflect our individuality, we are able to build strong and meaningful relationships with others who share similar values and beliefs.

In addition to these benefits, being confident in the decisions that we make can lead to greater success and happiness in life. When we are confident in our decisions, we are able to trust our instincts and take action without hesitation. This can lead to greater success in both our personal and professional lives. Furthermore, being confident in our decisions can lead to greater happiness and fulfillment in life, as we are able to live our lives in accordance with our values and beliefs.

In conclusion, making our own decisions is crucial for personal growth and development.

Arts classes such as music, painting, drawing, and theater provide an opportunity for students to explore their interests and talents outside of the traditional academic subjects.

Firstly, arts education allows individuals to express their feelings and emotions through different forms of art. For instance, students may use painting or drawing to depict a particular emotion or event that they have experienced. This form of self-expression can be therapeutic and helps students develop their emotional intelligence, which is crucial in today's world.

Moreover, arts education helps students develop creativity and critical thinking skills. In music, students learn to read sheet music and create their melodies, which requires creativity and problem-solving skills. Similarly, theater classes teach students how to analyze scripts and develop characters, which requires critical thinking and creativity. These skills are valuable in various fields, including science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).

 Failure. The word itself can send shivers down the spine of even the most confident individual. It's a word that can evoke feelings of disappointment, frustration, and self-doubt. But, is failure really a negative thing? In my opinion, failure is one of the most valuable experiences we can have in life. It's a silent teacher, guiding us towards success and growth.

Personally, I've experienced my fair share of failures. From bombing a test in math class to not making the basketball team, I've felt the sting of defeat. But, looking back, I realize that those failures were some of the most important experiences of my life. They taught me valuable lessons about perseverance, resilience, and self-motivation.

For instance, when I didn't make the basketball team, I was devastated. I had put in so much time and effort, and yet, I still came up short. But, instead of giving up, I used that failure as motivation to work even harder. I started practicing every day, pushing myself to be better. And, the next year, I made the team.

Similarly, when I bombed that math test, I felt like a total failure. But, I didn't let that one setback hold me back. I studied even harder, and my next test score improved significantly. I learned that failure is not the end of the world, but rather a stepping stone towards success.

The role of self-motivation in using failure as an opportunity to grow and succeed cannot be overstated. When we fail, we have two choices: we can let it discourage us, or we can use it as fuel to push ourselves harder. The latter is exactly what I did. I realized that I had the power to turn my failures into successes.

In conclusion, failure is not something to be feared or avoided. It's an inevitable part of life that can teach us valuable lessons and help us grow. By embracing failure and using it as an opportunity to learn and improve, we can turn what seems like a negative experience into a positive one. So, the next time you fail, don't give up.

E1898E71ABD6,"Positive Attitude: The Key to Success in Life

Introduction

The way we think and approach challenges in life can greatly impact our success. A positive attitude is an essential component of achieving our goals and living a fulfilling life. In this essay, we will explore the benefits of having a positive attitude, analyze successful individuals who have achieved success through their positive attitude, and discuss practical strategies for maintaining and developing a positive attitude.

The Benefits of Positive Attitude

Having a positive attitude has numerous benefits in both personal and professional life. It can help us overcome challenges, increase productivity, and improve our overall well-being. Research has shown that people with a positive attitude tend to have better physical and mental health, stronger relationships, and greater job satisfaction (Smith, 2019).

Additionally, a positive attitude can help us attract opportunities and resources that we may not have otherwise noticed. When we believe in ourselves and our abilities, we are more likely to take risks and pursue our dreams. This can lead to greater success and fulfillment in life.

Cases of Successful Individuals with Positive Attitude

Many successful individuals have attributed their success to their positive attitude. One such individual is Oprah Winfrey, who has said, ""I believe that everything happens in life happens in an opportunity to choose love over fear"" (Winfrey, 2018). Her positive attitude and ability to find the good in every situation has helped her overcome adversity and achieve great success.

Another example is Steve Jobs, who famously said, ""Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do"" (Jobs, 2011). His positive attitude towards his work and his ability to believe in himself helped him create innovative products and transform the technology industry.

Challenges of Maintaining a Positive Attitude

While having a positive attitude can have numerous benefits, it is not always easy to maintain. Life can be unpredictable and challenging, and it can be difficult to stay positive in the face of adversity. Additionally, negative thoughts and beliefs can be deeply ingrained and difficult to overcome.

Similarly, when mistakes are made in our personal or professional lives, we can use them as a learning experience and implement better ways of working. 

Ultimately, committing mistakes in life can be beneficial if done in the right way. We should acknowledge that mistakes are simply part of the process and use them to fuel our motivation to succeed.

C262F0931AA1,"The debate on whether people should make their own decisions or seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters is a complex and multifaceted one. On one hand, proponents of individual decision-making argue that people have the right to make their own choices and that experts and authorities often have conflicting opinions or agendas. On the other hand, opponents of individual decision-making argue that seeking guidance from experts and authorities can lead to better outcomes and that individuals often lack the necessary knowledge or experience to make informed decisions. In this essay, I will analyze both sides of the debate and provide a conclusion on the best approach.

On the one hand, proponents of individual decision-making argue that people have the right to make their own choices. They believe that individuals should be free to choose their own paths in life, and that experts and authorities often have conflicting opinions or agendas. They argue that individuals should be trusted to make their own decisions, as they are the ones who will be most affected by the consequences of those decisions. Additionally, they argue that seeking guidance from experts and authorities can often lead to conflicting advice, and that individuals should be able to weigh the pros and cons of different options and make their own decisions based on their own values and priorities.

On the other hand, opponents of individual decision-making argue that seeking guidance from experts and authorities can lead to better outcomes. They believe that individuals often lack the necessary knowledge or experience to make informed decisions, and that seeking guidance from experts and authorities can help to mitigate the risks of making poor choices. Additionally, they argue that experts and authorities often have a wealth of knowledge and experience that can be valuable in making important decisions, and that individuals should seek their guidance in order to make the best possible choices.

In my opinion, the best approach to decision-making is a balance between individual decision-making and seeking guidance from experts and authorities. While individuals should be trusted to make their own decisions, they should also seek guidance from experts and authorities when making important decisions that will have a significant impact on their lives. This will help to ensure that individuals are making informed decisions that are based on their own values and priorities, while also taking into account the knowledge and experience of experts and authorities.

AC0AAA109FA6,"As students, it is our responsibility to give back to our community. This is why I advocate for the requirement to perform community service in elementary school. Community service not only builds character and a sense of responsibility but also provides meaningful life experiences that will stay with us as we grow and pursue our goals. 

In a reasonable amount of time, students can volunteer at a shelter, help with food drives, participate in neighborhood clean-up days, or mentor younger students. Community service teaches us important values such as cooperation, teamwork, and selflessness. It helps us develop leadership skills and a more comprehensive view of our place in the world.

For example, in a small village in India, a group of elementary students got together to start a compost bin project. They created a composting system that was easier to maintain and more effective than anything the village had previously done. Through their actions, the students showed leadership and inspired others to help make their community a better place. This real-life example proves that community service not only benefits the community but also strengthens the lives of elementary school students who take part in it.

In conclusion, I believe that making community service a requirement within the school curriculum is an important step in teaching our youth invaluable lessons that will help them become positive contributors to our society. By investing our time and energy in community service, we can bring a wealth of new opportunities to our communities and foster a greater sense of belonging.",1,0.9944383,1,True
ABF21C9A2160,"In today's fast-paced and ever-changing world, it can be challenging to be oneself. With the advent of new technology and constantly evolving social norms, it is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain one's identity and remain true to oneself. In this essay, I will explore the reasons why it is difficult to be oneself in a constantly changing world and how individuals can navigate these challenges.

Firstly, the constant influx of new technology has made it easier for people to connect with others across the globe. While this has its advantages, it has also made it easier for individuals to compare themselves to others and feel like they are not good enough. Social media platforms, in particular, have created a culture of perfectionism where people are constantly posting pictures of their ideal lives, which can lead to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem.

Secondly, social norms are constantly changing, making it difficult for individuals to keep up. For example, what was considered acceptable behavior a few years ago may not be acceptable today. This can be seen in the way people dress, the way they communicate, and the way they express themselves. As a result, individuals may feel like they are constantly trying to fit into a mold that is constantly shifting, making it difficult to be oneself.

Finally, the pressure to conform to societal expectations can be overwhelming. People are often expected to have certain careers, relationships, and lifestyles based on their age, gender, race, and other factors. This can lead to individuals feeling like they are not living up to expectations and are not being true to themselves.

Despite these challenges, there are ways for individuals to navigate them and remain true to themselves. Firstly, individuals should focus on developing their own sense of self-worth and self-esteem. This can be done through activities such as meditation, therapy, and self-reflection. By focusing on their own values and beliefs, individuals can develop a strong sense of self that is not influenced by external factors.

Secondly, individuals should embrace the idea that it is okay to be different. Instead of trying to fit into a mold, individuals should strive to be themselves and embrace their unique qualities. This can be done through activities such as pursuing hobbies and interests that are not mainstream and expressing oneself in a way that is authentic and true to oneself.",1,0.99449944,1,True

Curfew laws have been implemented in many cities around the world to regulate the behavior of teenagers. While some people believe that curfew laws are necessary to ensure the safety of teenagers, others argue that they are an infringement on their civil liberties. In this essay, I will research and analyze the pros and cons of implementing a curfew law for teenagers in a given city.

Pros of a Curfew Law

One of the main advantages of a curfew law is that it can help to reduce the number of accidents and crimes committed by teenagers. Teenagers who are out late at night are more likely to be involved in accidents, and they may also be more likely to commit crimes. By implementing a curfew law, the city can ensure that teenagers are home before it gets too dark, reducing the risk of accidents and crimes.

Another advantage of a curfew law is that it can help to improve the academic performance of teenagers. Teenagers who are out late at night are more likely to miss school or fall behind on their homework. By implementing a curfew law, the city can ensure that teenagers are home and able to focus on their studies.

Cons of a Curfew Law

One of the main disadvantages of a curfew law is that it can be an infringement on the civil liberties of teenagers. Teenagers who are out late at night may be doing nothing wrong, and they may feel that they are being punished for no reason. This can lead to resentment and a sense of injustice among teenagers.

Another disadvantage of a curfew law is that it can be difficult to enforce. Teenagers who are determined to break the curfew law may find ways to do so, such as by using fake identification or by hiding out in public places. This can make it difficult for law enforcement to enforce the law effectively.

Conclusion

In conclusion, implementing a curfew law for teenagers in a given city has both pros and cons. While it can help to reduce the number of accidents and crimes committed by teenagers and improve their academic performance, it can also be an infringement on their civil liberties and difficult to enforce. Ultimately, the decision to implement a curfew law should be based",1,0.9944089,1,True
AD5621D2A958,"First impressions are an important aspect of how we perceive and interact with others. However, these initial perceptions can change depending on the context in which they are formed. In job interviews, the first impression can be influenced by the candidate's appearance, body language, and responses to questions. In the first day of school, the first impression can be influenced by the student's behavior, academic performance, and interactions with peers.

Studies have shown that first impressions can be influenced by a variety of factors. For example, in a study by Walster et al. (1966), participants were asked to make quick judgments about others based on their appearance. The researchers found that participants tended to make negative judgments about individuals with disfigurements, even though they had no personal experience with those individuals. This suggests that first impressions can be influenced by cultural and societal norms.

Similarly, in job interviews, the first impression can be influenced by the candidate's appearance and body language. A study by Schmitt and Buss (1993) found that people tend to make judgments about others based on their facial features, such as the shape of their nose and the size of their lips. This suggests that first impressions can be influenced by physical appearance.

In the first day of school, the first impression can be influenced by the student's behavior and academic performance. A study by Rubin (1975) found that students who were perceived as academically competent were more likely to be liked by their peers. This suggests that first impressions can be influenced by academic performance.

In addition to these factors, first impressions can also be influenced by the context in which they are formed. For example, in a job interview, the first impression may be influenced by the candidate's responses to specific questions. In the first day of school, the first impression may be influenced by the student's behavior in the classroom.

Overall, studies have shown that first impressions can change in different contexts, and that these changes can be influenced by a variety of factors. It is important to be aware of these factors and to be mindful of how they may be influencing our perceptions and interactions with others. By being aware of these factors, we can make more informed decisions and form more accurate first impressions.",1,0.9941731,1,True

So, what's the difference between these two scenarios? Why do some soccer players try different things, while others specialize in one thing? Well, I think it's because everyone is different, and what works for one person might not work for another. 🤷‍♀️ For example, Pique might enjoy playing the guitar and starting a charity, but Messi might not have the time or interest in those things.

falcon_180b_v1_614,"In my opinion, I believe the minimum wage in our country should be raised. The current minimum wage is not enough for people to support themselves and their families, especially in today's economy where the cost of living continues to rise. Here are a few reasons why I think the minimum wage should be increased.

First, the cost of living has increased over the years, but the minimum wage has not kept pace with these changes. For example, the cost of housing, food, and healthcare has gone up significantly. As a result, many people struggle to make ends meet even when they work multiple jobs. Increasing the minimum wage can help alleviate some of this financial pressure and ensure that people can afford basic necessities.

Secondly, raising the minimum wage can boost the economy. When people have more money to spend, they tend to spend it, which increases demand for goods and services. Increased demand can lead to more job opportunities, which can help reduce unemployment rates.

Lastly, raising the minimum wage can reduce income inequality. Currently, a small percentage of the population holds a significant portion of the wealth while the majority struggles to get by. Raising the minimum wage can help bridge this gap and create a more equal society.

In conclusion, raising the minimum wage is a complex issue that requires careful consideration. However, I believe that the potential benefits far outweigh the potential negative consequences, and it is time for our government to take action and ensure that all citizens have access to a decent standard of living.",1,0.99447745,1,True

Firstly, marijuana is a drug and just like other drugs, it can be addictive. If it is legalized, it will become more accessible to the public, which means that more people will have the opportunity to try it. This could lead to an increase in the number of people who become addicted to the drug. Addiction can be a serious problem and it can lead to other issues such as financial problems, job loss, and even criminal activity.

Secondly, marijuana can have negative effects on a person's health. It can cause problems with memory, concentration, and coordination. It can also affect a person's ability to think clearly and make good decisions. In addition, marijuana smoke can be just as harmful as tobacco smoke and can lead to health problems such as lung cancer and respiratory infections.

Thirdly, legalizing marijuana could lead to an increase in crime. If marijuana is legalized, it will become easier for people to obtain it. This could lead to an increase in the number of people who drive under the influence of the drug, which could result in more accidents on the road. It could also lead to an increase in drug-related crime as people may resort to illegal activities in order to obtain the drug.

In conclusion, I believe that marijuana should not be legalized. It is a drug that can be addictive, harmful to a person's health, and could lead to an increase in crime.

""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts."" - Winston Churchill

As an 8th grader, I've experienced my fair share of failures. From struggling in math to bombing a science project, it's easy to feel like a failure. But, as I've learned, failure is not the opposite of success, it's an integral part of it.

When we fail, we learn what went wrong. Maybe we didn't study enough, or we didn't ask for help when we needed it. Whatever the reason, failure gives us the opportunity to improve. It's like getting a second chance to do something right. Without failure, we wouldn't know what we need to work on, and we wouldn't be able to grow.

Moreover, failure helps us build underlying strength. When we face challenges, we learn to persevere. We learn to push through the hard times and keep going. This strengthens our character and makes us more resilient. It's like building muscle - the more we exercise, the stronger we get.

For example, I once tried out for the school play, but I didn't get the role I wanted. I was devastated at first, but then I realized that I could use that experience to improve my acting skills. I started taking classes and practicing more, and the next time I tried out, I got the lead role. If I had given up after the first failure, I never would have achieved my goal.

Finally, failure helps us become better people. When we fail, we learn to be more humble and to appreciate the efforts of others. We learn that everyone makes mistakes, and that it's okay to ask for help. We become more empathetic and understanding towards others, and we learn to be more supportive.

In conclusion, failure is not something to be feared or avoided. It's an essential part of the journey to success.

Firstly, the program would provide a platform for older students to review notes and study materials with younger students, particularly for important tests such as the SOLs. This would help the younger students feel more confident and prepared for these exams, as they would have the opportunity to receive additional support and guidance from their peers. Additionally, the older students could help the younger students with their homework and assignments, which would not only make their academic life easier but also help them understand the material better.

Furthermore, the program could also include recreational activities such as board games, reading, and sports. These activities would provide a break from the academic routine and allow the students to bond over shared interests. The older students could teach the younger students new games or sports, or even just play together, which would help build their relationships and create a sense of community.

C65705E1E072,"First impressions are the initial thoughts and opinions that people have about someone or something. They are often based on nonverbal cues such as appearance, body language, and tone of voice. However, humans' first impressions can be influenced and changed based on environmental and parental factors. In this essay, I will explore how these factors can affect first impressions and how they can be changed.

Environmental factors can greatly influence first impressions. For example, people may form a negative first impression of someone if they are in a loud and crowded environment. This is because the noise and chaos can make it difficult to focus on the person's behavior and demeanor. On the other hand, people may form a positive first impression if they are in a quiet and peaceful environment. This is because the calmness and serenity can make it easier to notice and appreciate the person's positive qualities.

Parental factors can also play a role in shaping first impressions. Children are often taught to judge people based on their appearance and behavior. For example, if a child is taught that people with short hair are aggressive, they may form a negative first impression of someone with short hair, even if they have never met them before. Similarly, if a child is taught that people who are quiet and reserved are shy, they may form a positive first impression of someone who is quiet and reserved, even if they are not necessarily shy.

However, it is important to note that first impressions can be changed based on new information and experiences. For example, if someone initially formed a negative first impression of someone based on their appearance, but later learned that the person was kind and generous, they may change their first impression to a positive one. Similarly, if someone initially formed a positive first impression of someone based on their behavior, but later learned that the person was not trustworthy, they may change their first impression to a negative one.

In conclusion, humans' first impressions can be influenced and changed based on environmental and parental factors. It is important to be aware of these factors and to be open to changing our first impressions based on new information and experiences. By doing so, we can form more accurate and positive first impressions of others, which can lead to better relationships and interactions.",1,0.99443734,1,True

It can be complex—bound by tradition and formed by spiritual beliefs—and can help to provide a sense of identity and community. In some cases, students may even experience opposition to healthy lunch options if the food largely does not reflect their cultural habits. Therefore, schools must be mindful of their students' backgrounds and ensure that school lunch options can still cater to their needs. 

Ultimately, childhood obesity continues to be a prevalent public health problem, and unhealthy food choices in school can put students at higher risk. To address this, schools can implement healthier lunch options to reduce the risk of obesity-related diseases. While the upfront costs of switching to healthier options may be higher, long-term returns could have benefits for both current and future generations. These potential benefits could include lowered healthcare costs, reduced rates of chronic diseases, and improved long-term cognitive and physical development.",1,0.99468815,1,True

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to you today to express my support for the current Electoral College system used in the election of the President of the United States. While some argue that it is an outdated and undemocratic method, I believe that it serves important purposes and provides several advantages that outweigh the disadvantages.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures the certainty of outcome. As mentioned in ""In Defense of the Electoral College"" by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College consistently exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that the winner of the presidency is more likely to have a clear majority of electoral votes, reducing the chance of disputes over the outcome. In a country as diverse as ours, it is essential to have a system that provides a clear winner and avoids prolonged legal battles, as witnessed in the 2000 election.

Another significant advantage of the Electoral College is that it ensures the election of a president with trans-regional appeal. As Judge Posner states, no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This forces candidates to campaign in various states across the country, rather than focusing solely on heavily populated areas or regions where they have the most support. This requirement promotes a president who represents the interests of the entire nation, rather than just one particular region.

The Electoral College also encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. These states, as mentioned in Judge Posner's article, are often the ones where the outcome is uncertain and could go either way. Voters in swing states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign and the issues at hand because they know their votes will have a significant impact on the election. This results in a more engaged electorate and a better-informed decision-making process.

Furthermore, the Electoral College restores balance and prevents the dominance of large states. As Judge Posner points out, the mal-apportionment of the Senate and the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes help ensure that candidates pay attention to the concerns of both small and large states. While the popular vote may favor candidates who focus solely on the interests of heavily populated areas, the Electoral College encourages candidates to address the needs of voters across the country.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the complexity of run-off elections. Instead of potentially having multiple rounds of voting to determine a winner, the Electoral College always produces a clear victor. This simplifies the election process and ensures that the country can move forward swiftly, without any uncertainty or prolonged periods of political instability.

While critics argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters who live in states where their preferred candidate is unlikely to win, it is important to note that voter turnout in presidential elections remains high. As mentioned in Judge Posner's article, approximately half of the eligible American population voted in the 2012 election. This shows that voters are motivated to express their political preferences, even if the outcome may not swing an election.

In conclusion, I believe that the Electoral College provides necessary checks and balances in our presidential election process and ensures that the president represents the diverse interests of the entire nation. It guarantees a clear winner, encourages candidates to campaign nationwide, gives voice to both small and large states, and streamlines the election process. While the system is not perfect, it has proven effective over the years and should be retained.

Thank you for considering my stance on this matter. I urge you to support the Electoral College system and continue to make decisions in the best interests of our nation.

Sincerely,

6397201c,"Dear [State Senator],

I am writing to express my opinion on the topic of the Electoral College and whether we should keep it or change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. After carefully considering the arguments from multiple sources, I believe that we should keep the Electoral College for several reasons.

One of the main advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. As stated in the text by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate’s share of the Electoral College usually exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that the possibility of a dispute over the outcome is lower compared to a direct popular vote. In the 2012 election, President Obama received 61.7% of the electoral vote, even though he only had 51.3% of the popular vote. This shows that the Electoral College tends to create a clear winner.

Another important reason to keep the Electoral College is to ensure that the president is everyone's president. With its requirement for a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president on its own. This encourages candidates to campaign in different regions and consider the interests of all Americans. By having candidates with broader appeal, we can avoid the feeling of disenfranchisement that residents of certain regions may experience if they believe their votes do not count.

The Electoral College also brings attention to swing states. In the text by Judge Richard A. Posner, it is mentioned that the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes leads candidates to focus their campaign efforts on toss-up states. This means that voters in these states, who are most likely to decide the election, pay closer attention to the campaign. By engaging these voters, we can ensure that the most thoughtful and informed citizens have a say in choosing the president.

Additionally, the Electoral College helps balance the influence of big states. As Judge Richard A. Posner points out, the Electoral College restores some weight to large states that would otherwise be overshadowed by the mal-apportionment of the Senate. This ensures that presidential candidates pay attention to the concerns and interests of citizens in large states, as winning their votes can have a greater impact on the election outcome.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections. In instances where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, such as Richard Nixon in 1968 and Bill Clinton in 1992, the Electoral College has provided a clear winner. This eliminates the need for complicated additional elections and ensures a more efficient and decisive process.

While there are valid arguments against the Electoral College, such as those presented in the text by Bradford Plumer, the information provided in Judge Richard A. Posner's text provides practical reasons for retaining it. It fosters certainty in the outcome, ensures that the president represents all Americans, focuses attention on swing states, balances the influence of big states, and avoids the need for run-off elections.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that the Electoral College should be kept. It may have its flaws, but it provides a practical and effective method for electing the president of the United States. It promotes fairness, ensures the president represents all citizens, and balances the influence of different states. Thank you for considering my viewpoint on this important matter.

D9AAC11BC7AC,"Good morning! Today, I'm going to talk about the different attitudes people display in the morning and afternoon.

In the morning, people tend to be more relaxed and laid back. They usually wake up later and take their time getting ready for the day. They might spend time reading the news, having breakfast, or just lounging around the house. People in the morning are usually less stressed and more focused on enjoying their free time before the day starts.

On the other hand, in the afternoon, people tend to be more stressed and rushed. They usually wake up earlier and have a more structured routine. They might have to get ready for work or school, pack their bags, and rush out the door. People in the afternoon are usually more focused on getting things done and being on time.

One example of someone displaying a good attitude in the morning is my grandma. She wakes up early, but she takes her time getting ready. She enjoys having breakfast with her husband and reading the newspaper. She's not stressed or rushed, and she's able to enjoy her morning before the day starts.

On the other hand, one example of someone displaying a bad attitude in the afternoon is my neighbor. He wakes up early and rushes out the door without having breakfast. He's always in a hurry and seems stressed out. He's always late for work and complains about it.

In conclusion, people's attitudes in the morning and afternoon are different due to the different tasks they have to do. In the morning, people tend to be more relaxed and laid back, while in the afternoon, they tend to be more stressed and rushed. By understanding these differences, we can learn to manage our time better and improve our attitudes.",1,0.992949,1,True
E91431653DE3,"Hey there!  So, like, individuality is a pretty important thing in today's society, right? I mean, it's all about being yourself and not trying to fit in with the crowd. But, like, sometimes I feel like people are too focused on being different and standing out, rather than just being themselves. 

Anyway, Waldo Ralph Waldo Emerson was like, this super smart dude who said that being an individual is the key to success. He believed that people shouldn't conform to traditional ideas and should just be themselves. But, like, I'm not sure if that's totally accurate today. I mean, sure, it's important to be different and unique, but sometimes I think people take it too far and end up being, like, total weirdos. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is that individuality is important, but it's also important to be able to fit in and be a part of society. Like, you don't have to be a total outcast to be successful. You can still be yourself and be part of a group, you know? 

I think Emerson's perspective is a little outdated, to be honest. I mean, back in his time, people didn't have social media and stuff, so it was easier to be an individual without getting judged or anything. But nowadays, it's like, everyone's so worried about being online and being popular, that they forget to just be themselves.

I don't know, maybe I'm just not cool enough to understand the whole individuality thing, but like, I think there's a balance to be found between being yourself and fitting in. 

Anyway, that's my two cents on the matter.  What do you think? Do you agree or disagree? Let me know in the comments!",1,0.99436694,1,True
C5B351564A3F,"As the debate over how to best enhance the educational system rages on, one potential solution that has recently captivated the attention of many is extending the school day two hours in a four-day school week. Supporters of this plan point to the potential benefits, such as students having more time to dedicate to mastering core material and teachers having the opportunity to provide more personalized instruction and one-on-one time. They also point out the potential for creative activities, such as extracurriculars, clubs, and field trips, to be better integrated into the structure of a shortened school week.

However, upping the amount of time our children spend at school can also have some unwanted side effects. For one, students may feel overwhelmed and exhausted by the amount of schoolwork and homework they must take on with the extended school day. In addition, lack of sleep, an unhealthy diet, and increased exposure to stress can all lead to poor academic performance. Furthermore, there may be costs associated with the shift to a four-day week that are too expensive for some families.

Ultimately, it is crucial that all stakeholders—parents, teachers, administrators, and students—come together and carefully weigh the potential advantages and disadvantages of extending the school day two hours in a four-day week before enacting any changes. It is only through discussion and thoughtful deliberation that we can ensure that such changes will be made in the best interest of our children’s education.",1,0.9945257,1,True
llama_70b_v11072,"Introduction:
Hey there, I know you're really into the idea that aliens created the Face on Mars, but let me tell you, as a scientist at NASA, I'm here to convince you that it's just a natural landform. I know it might seem like a wild idea, but hear me out and let's look at the evidence.

Body:
First of all, let's talk about the size of the Face. The article mentions that it's about a mile wide and a mile long, which is huge! But, it's not that unusual for natural landforms on Mars. In fact, the article says that there are other formations on the planet that are even bigger. So, just because it's big, doesn't mean it's not natural.

Next, let's look at the shape of the Face. It's true that it looks kind of like a face, but that's just a coincidence. The article explains that the Face is actually a hill that was formed by the movement of rocks and soil. It's not a perfect rectangle or anything, it's just a natural shape that happens to resemble a face.

Another thing to consider is the location of the Face. It's not like it's in a remote area where aliens might have easily landed and built it. Nope, it's right in the middle of a bunch of other natural formations. It would have been really hard for aliens to get there without us noticing, don't you think?

Finally, let's talk about the materials that make up the Face. The article says that it's made of the same stuff as the rest of Mars - rocks and soil. There's nothing special or unusual about it. If aliens had built it, wouldn't they have used some kind of advanced technology or materials?

Conclusion:
So, there you have it! I hope I've made a good case for why the Face on Mars is just a natural landform. It's not that exciting, I know, but sometimes the most logical explanation is the best one. I'm not saying aliens don't exist, but in this case, it's just not likely that they built the Face. Thanks for listening to my argument, and I hope you can see things from my perspective!",1,0.9934455,1,True

I am writing to you today to discuss the issue of allowing students to use their cellphones during school hours. I believe that there are both advantages and disadvantages to this policy, and I would like to present my argument in favor of allowing cellphones.

First and foremost, allowing cellphones in school can greatly enhance communication between students and teachers. With cellphones, students can easily contact their teachers if they have any questions or concerns. This can be especially helpful for students who are struggling with a particular concept or topic, as they can quickly get in touch with their teacher for additional help.

Additionally, cellphones can be used as a valuable learning tool. There are many educational apps and games available that can help students learn new concepts and reinforce their knowledge. By allowing cellphones in school, students can take advantage of these resources and continue learning outside of the classroom.

However, there are also some potential disadvantages to allowing cellphones in school. For example, cellphones can be a distraction to some students, and they may use them to play games or watch videos instead of paying attention to class. Additionally, there is always the risk of cyberbullying or other negative behavior occurring through cellphone communication.

To address these concerns, I propose that there be certain guidelines in place to ensure that cellphones are used appropriately in school. For example, students could be required to turn off their cellphones during class, and there could be designated times during the day when students are allowed to use their cellphones. Additionally, there could be strict rules in place to prevent cyberbullying or other negative behavior.

In conclusion, I believe that allowing students to use their cellphones during school hours can have many advantages, including enhanced communication and increased learning opportunities. As long as there are appropriate guidelines in place to ensure that cellphones are used responsibly, I believe that this policy would be beneficial for both students and teachers.

As an 8th grader, I've noticed that there's this common notion that we need to be constantly working and productive. Like, if we're not doing something ""useful"" or ""productive,"" we're not really achieving our full potential. But, I think this mindset can be really harmful and can lead to burnout, decreased creativity, and poor mental and physical health.

Research shows that taking breaks can actually improve the quality of our work. When we give our brains a chance to rest and recharge, we come back to our tasks with renewed focus and creativity. Plus, breaks can help us avoid procrastination and distractions, which can lead to better time management and productivity.  Like, I know I'm guilty of scrolling through TikTok instead of doing my homework, but breaks can help me stay on track.

Taking breaks can also have serious physical and mental health benefits. For example, studies have shown that taking short breaks throughout the day can reduce stress and anxiety, improve mood, and boost energy levels.  I know I feel way more chill after a quick walk or some coloring time. And, getting enough rest and relaxation can even improve our sleep quality, which is like, super important for our overall health.

Now, I know some people might argue that taking breaks means we're not working hard enough or that we're being lazy. But, I think that's a pretty narrow-minded view. Taking breaks doesn't mean we're not committed to our work or goals. It means we're taking care of ourselves so we can be our best selves and achieve our goals in a sustainable way.  Like, I want to be a successful writer, but I also want to be able to enjoy my life and not feel burnt out from working too much.

Personally, I've found that taking breaks has helped me stay focused and motivated. When I'm working on a project, I try to take short breaks every hour or so to stretch, move around, and do something fun.

A9544F0E8868,"First impressions are the initial thoughts and feelings that a person has about another person. They are formed within seconds of meeting someone and can greatly influence the way people interact with each other. First impressions can be used to reflect someone's personality in various ways.

One way first impressions can reflect someone's personality is through their appearance. For example, if a person is dressed in a clean and well-fitting suit, they may be perceived as confident and professional. On the other hand, if a person is wearing dirty clothes and has unkempt hair, they may be perceived as careless and unprofessional.

Another way first impressions can reflect someone's personality is through their behavior and attitude. For example, if a person is smiling, making eye contact, and showing interest in the conversation, they may be perceived as friendly and approachable. On the other hand, if a person is frowning, avoiding eye contact, and appearing distant, they may be perceived as unfriendly and unapproachable.

First impressions can also have a lasting impact on relationships. For example, if someone makes a negative first impression on a potential friend or colleague, they may struggle to form a positive relationship with that person in the future. On the other hand, if someone makes a positive first impression, they may be more likely to form a strong and lasting relationship with that person.

Kindness and respect for others can also help form positive first impressions. When a person is kind and respectful towards others, they may be perceived as compassionate and empathetic. This can lead to a positive first impression and may make it easier for that person to form strong relationships with others.

However, it is important to note that first impressions can be impossible to change. Once a person has formed an initial opinion about someone, it can be difficult to change that opinion.

llama_70b_v11164,"Meat consumption has become a controversial topic in recent years, with many advocating for a reduction in meat consumption due to environmental and health concerns. The question is, should we adopt a vegetarian or vegan diet? In my opinion, adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet is a good idea, and here's why.

Firstly, there's the environmental impact of meat consumption to consider. The production of meat, especially beef, is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, the livestock sector is responsible for 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, which is more than the entire transportation sector. By reducing our meat consumption, we can significantly reduce our carbon footprint and help combat climate change.

Secondly, there's the health benefit of a vegetarian or vegan diet. Studies have shown that a plant-based diet can reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. This is because plant-based diets tend to be high in fiber, vitamins, and minerals, and low in saturated fats and cholesterol. Plus, a vegetarian or vegan diet can also help with weight management, as it tends to be lower in calories.

Another benefit of a vegetarian or vegan diet is the ethical aspect. Factory farming, which is the dominant method of meat production, can be cruel and inhumane. Animals are often kept in cramped and unsanitary conditions, and are subjected to practices such as beak trimming, tail docking, and castration. By adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet, we can help reduce the demand for factory-farmed meat and promote more humane treatment of animals.

Finally, there's the food security aspect. With the global population projected to reach 9 billion by 2050, finding sustainable ways to feed everyone is a pressing issue. A vegetarian or vegan diet requires less land, water, and energy than a meat-based diet, making it a more sustainable option for food security.

Now, some people may argue that a vegetarian or vegan diet is lacking in certain nutrients, such as protein and iron. However, this is simply not true. There are plenty of plant-based sources of protein and iron, such as beans, lentils, tofu, and spinach. With a little bit of planning, it's easy to get all the nutrients you need on a vegetarian or vegan diet.

In conclusion, adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet is a good idea for several reasons. It can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, promote better health, support more humane treatment of animals, and contribute to food security. So, let's make a positive change and adopt a vegetarian or vegan diet for a better future.",1,0.99424803,1,True

On the one hand, graduating from high school in three years can have several benefits. Firstly, it can save students and their families money on tuition fees and other expenses associated with attending college. Additionally, early graduates can start their careers earlier, which can give them a head start in life. Furthermore, they can explore their interests and passions without feeling rushed to finish high school.

On the other hand, there are also several drawbacks to consider. For instance, students who graduate early may miss out on important social interactions and experiences that are crucial for their personal and emotional development. They may also struggle to adapt to the faster pace of college courses, leading to academic difficulties. Moreover, early graduation can limit students' opportunities for extracurricular activities and leadership roles, which can impact their college applications and future career prospects.

One way to mitigate these drawbacks is by taking elective classes that align with students' interests and passions. These classes can help students develop their creativity and skills, making them more successful in their future endeavors. For example, a student interested in photography can take a photography class to develop their skills and create a portfolio to showcase their work. Similarly, a student interested in business can take a entrepreneurship class to learn how to start and run their own business.

Another important factor to consider is the impact of early graduation on knowledge retention. While graduating early can save time and money, it can also lead to a lack of retention of knowledge. Students who graduate early may struggle to keep up with the faster pace of college courses, leading to lower grades and academic difficulties.

This means that if you commit to a career at a young age, you'll have the opportunity to learn and develop your skills more quickly, giving you a head start in your chosen field.

Another advantage of committing to a career at a young age is the mental and knowledge preparation it provides. When you're young, you have the time and energy to focus on your career goals without the added stress of other responsibilities like a job or family. This means that you can dedicate yourself fully to your career, learning and growing in a way that will help you succeed in the long run. Additionally, committing to a career at a young age can help you build a strong foundation of knowledge and skills, which will make it easier to adapt to new challenges and opportunities as you grow and develop.

However, I also understand that some students may not want to commit to a career at a young age. Maybe they're still exploring their interests and passions, or maybe they're unsure of what they want to do in the future. It's important to recognize that everyone's journey is different, and there's no one-size-fits-all approach to career development.

Though teams can come to better solutions than individuals, not every situation calls for a group effort, and sometimes, having multiple people working on the same thing can be more of a distraction. Additionally, disagreements can arise in group settings, and individual goals and motivations can get lost.

No matter which approach yields better results, working in teams or working alone, there are lasting memories which can be gained from both. From working alone, strength in self-sufficiency and independence can arise. From working in teams, strong connections and community are built. For workers in the future, reflecting on the experiences with others, and the memories created will continue to be beneficial.",1,0.99468625,1,True
D22D2878F4C7,"Honesty is a virtue that is highly valued in society. Being honest is important in all aspects of life, whether it's in personal relationships, at work, or in school. In this essay, I will discuss the importance of being honest all the time and provide examples of situations where honesty is crucial.

The first situation where honesty is important is when you don't like someone. It's easy to lie or sugarcoat your feelings when you don't want to hurt someone's feelings, but being honest is the best policy. If you don't like someone, it's important to communicate that to them in a respectful manner. For example, if you're in a group project with someone and you don't like their contribution, it's better to speak up and say that you don't feel like their ideas are helpful. Being honest will help you maintain a healthy relationship and avoid any misunderstandings.

Another situation where honesty is important is when you have to tell someone you did something wrong. It's easy to lie or deny responsibility when you've made a mistake, but being honest is the best way to handle the situation. If you've done something wrong, it's important to take responsibility for your actions and apologize. For example, if you accidentally broke someone's vase, it's better to admit that you did it and offer to help pay for it. Being honest will help you learn from your mistake and prevent any further damage to your relationship.

Finally, honesty is crucial in arguments. When you're in an argument with someone, it's important to be honest about your feelings and thoughts. Lying or denying responsibility will only make the situation worse and damage your relationship. For example, if you're in an argument with a friend about something they did, it's important to be honest about how their actions made you feel. Being honest will help you both understand each other's perspectives and find a solution to the problem.

In conclusion, honesty is a virtue that is highly valued in society. Being honest is important in all aspects of life, whether it's in personal relationships, at work, or in school. In the situations I've discussed, honesty is crucial for maintaining healthy relationships and avoiding any misunderstandings. It's important to always be honest, even",1,0.99443495,1,True
66C2FA45A48B,"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grade student on the topic of a four-day school week with ten-hour days:

Hey, guys! Today we're gonna talk about this crazy idea of having a four-day school week with ten-hour days. Like, I know it sounds cool at first, but let's think about it for real.

Okay, so the pros of this thing are that we'd have more time to do stuff on Fridays. Like, we could go to the mall or hang out with friends or something. And we'd have longer breaks between classes, so we could stretch our legs and get some fresh air. Plus, teachers could use that extra time to give us more help or teach us new stuff. That's cool, right?

But here's the thing. Ten hours a day is a long time. Like, it's a lot longer than the usual school day. And it's gonna be really hard to focus and learn stuff when we're so tired. Plus, our brains need breaks too, you know? And if we're in school for ten hours a day, we're not gonna have time to do other stuff we like, like sports or music or anything.

And what about our parents? They're gonna have to take care of us for longer hours too. Like, they might not be able to work as much, or they might have to find someone else to watch us. That could be expensive and stressful for them.

I don't know, guys. I think a four-day school week with ten-hour days might not be the best idea. It's like, we'd be getting more time off, but we'd also be missing out on other stuff. And our brains and bodies need rest too. So, I don't know. What do you guys think?

I am writing to express my opinion on the proposed policy change that requires students to have at least a grade B average to participate in sports or other activities. I believe that this policy change is not fair to many students who have a grade C average.

Firstly, not all students are academically gifted, and they may struggle to maintain a grade B average. They may have personal or family issues that affect their academic performance. It is not fair to punish them by denying them the opportunity to participate in sports or other activities, which can be beneficial to their physical and mental health.

Secondly, sports and other activities can help students to develop leadership, teamwork, and other valuable life skills. By restricting their participation based on academic grades, we may be denying them an opportunity to grow and develop as individuals. It is not fair to limit their potential by enforcing such a policy.

Lastly, some students may need the motivation of sports or other activities to improve their academic performance. By denying them the opportunity to participate, we may be discouraging them from trying harder and improving their grades.

In conclusion, I believe that the proposed policy change is not fair to many students and should not be implemented. Instead, we should focus on providing support and resources to help students improve their academic performance without denying them the opportunity to participate in sports or other activities.

Thank you for considering my opinion.

Sincerely,

falcon_180b_v1_613,"I firmly believe that governments worldwide should take immediate action to address the pressing issue of climate change, as the consequences of inaction will be catastrophic for the planet and future generations. There are several compelling reasons that support my position.

Firstly, climate change poses a significant threat to our natural environment. The earth's temperature is rising at an alarming rate, resulting in melting ice caps, rising sea levels, and an increase in extreme weather events such as hurricanes, droughts, and heatwaves. These environmental changes have a devastating impact on ecosystems, resulting in the loss of biodiversity, habitat destruction, and species extinction. For example, the Great Barrier Reef, one of the most biodiverse ecosystems on the planet, has seen a significant decline in recent years due to coral bleaching caused by warming ocean temperatures.

Secondly, the negative impacts of climate change extend beyond environmental concerns, affecting human health and economic growth. As the planet warms, the spread of diseases and pests will increase, leading to more frequent outbreaks of illnesses such as malaria and dengue fever. Additionally, the economic costs associated with climate change, including damage to infrastructure, loss of productivity, and declining tourism, will be staggering. In fact, a recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimated that the global cost of failing to act on climate change could exceed $54 trillion by the end of this century.

Finally, taking action to address climate change presents an opportunity for governments to invest in renewable energy sources, creating new jobs, spurring economic growth, and reducing our dependence on fossil fuels. For example, countries like Germany, Denmark, and China have seen significant economic benefits from their investments in wind, solar, and other clean technologies.

In conclusion, the evidence is clear that immediate action must be taken by governments worldwide to address the urgent threat of climate change. Failure to act now will result in irreparable damage to our planet and future generations' well-being. We must work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, protect our natural environment, and invest in a sustainable, clean energy future. The time for action is now, and we cannot afford to wait any longer.",1,0.9936427,1,True
94C1C9CD10B7,"As an eighth-grade student, I have been attending school for almost ten hours a day, five days a week. However, some schools have proposed adding an extra hour and thirty minutes to the school day. While some people believe that this would be beneficial, others argue that it would be detrimental. In this essay, I will be discussing the pros and cons of a school day one hour and thirty minutes longer.

On the one hand, having a longer school day could have several advantages. Firstly, it would allow for more time for students to learn and absorb new information. With an extra hour and thirty minutes, teachers could provide more in-depth lessons and activities that would help students better understand the material. Additionally, students could have more time to work on homework and assignments, which would improve their grades and overall academic performance.

Furthermore, a longer school day could also provide more opportunities for extracurricular activities. Many students are interested in participating in sports, music, and other clubs, but they often struggle to find time to balance their academic and extracurricular responsibilities. With an extra hour and thirty minutes, students could have more time to participate in these activities and develop new skills and interests.

On the other hand, a longer school day could also have several disadvantages. Firstly, it could lead to increased stress and burnout for students. With more time in school, students would have to endure more lessons, lectures, and assignments, which could be overwhelming and exhausting. Additionally, students may struggle to maintain a healthy work-life balance, as they would have to spend more time in school and less time on other activities outside of school.

Furthermore, a longer school day could also lead to a decrease in the quality of education. With more time in school, teachers may become overwhelmed and struggle to provide effective and engaging lessons. Additionally, students may become disengaged and disinterested in learning, as they may feel that the school day is too long and uninteresting.

In conclusion, a school day one hour and thirty minutes longer could have both advantages and disadvantages. While it could provide more time for learning, homework, and extracurricular activities, it could also lead to increased stress and burnout for students and a decrease in the quality of education.

CDBB3ACAD2C8,"Being honest is one of the most important qualities a person can possess. It is the foundation of any healthy relationship, and it is essential for building trust and respect. When we are honest, we show that we value the other person's opinion and that we are willing to listen to their perspective. This can help build stronger bonds and improve communication.

Being honest can also have a positive impact on our emotional well-being. When we are honest with ourselves, we can better understand our own feelings and thoughts. This can help us make better decisions and improve our overall mental health. Additionally, when we are honest with others, we can reduce the stress and anxiety that comes from hiding or lying. This can lead to a more peaceful and fulfilling life.

Honesty can also have a positive impact on society as a whole. When people are honest, they contribute to a more trustworthy and reliable environment. This can help to reduce crime and improve safety. Additionally, honesty can help to promote transparency and accountability in government and other institutions. This can lead to a more just and fair society.

In conclusion, being honest is an essential quality that can have a positive impact on people and society as a whole.

B9B71CEE162B,"Graduating high school in four years, rather than three, is often the better choice for students in search of a fulfilling educational program. Not only does the fourth year offer more opportunities to take interesting classes and extracurricular activities, but it also provides added protection against academic struggles, such as poor grades or a lack of credits.

For starters, the fourth year of high school provides additional time for students to enhance their education. Electives and extra study courses can be taken, allowing students to further specialize in their areas of interest. Extracurricular groups, such as student government or volunteer organizations, provide the opportunity to work together with like-minded peers. These activities offer a highly enriching learning experience, and give students the tools they need to achieve their aspirations.

Moreover, graduating high school in four years also protects against the consequences of a difficult academic path. Missing credits or a low GPA can carry serious repercussions when it comes time to apply to college. With the buffer of a fourth year, these issues can be addressed in a manageable and stress-free way. By adding an extra year of high school, a student can adjust their studies to ensure a successful transition.
 
In conclusion, for those looking to make the most of their high school experience, four years is often the right choice. With the flexibility of additional courses and the security of academic protection, graduating high school in four years gives students the opportunity to reach their full potential and transition seamlessly into the next stage of their life.",1,0.9944284,1,True

E481AA5C2F0B,"Having a positive attitude is essential for success in life. When we approach situations with a positive attitude, our minds become open and creative, allowing us to see all of the potential opportunities that await us. Not only does having a positive attitude enable us to see these opportunities, but it also gives us the motivation and confidence to take advantage of them.

To illustrate this, consider the example of applying for a job. When we have an optimistic attitude about the process, we feel more positive about the interview and our chances of landing the role. We appear more professional and confident to the interviewer, thereby increasing our chances of success. On the other hand, if we take on a pessimistic attitude and focus on scenarios where we may fail, we become more apprehensive and inhibited about the whole process, killing our chances of success even before we’ve started. Likewise, when studying for an exam, having a positive attitude enables us to stay focused on the task and to believe in our ability to remember the material.

The power of having a positive attitude goes beyond just making us feel better in the short-term. When we have a positive outlook, our brains become more oriented towards problem-solving, creative solutions, and success. In essence, a positive attitude is a differentiator for success in life. It is, therefore, vital for us to maintain an optimistic and motivated outlook if we want to make the most out of our life endeavors.",1,0.9946214,1,True
9860EE12D1B3,"As an 8th grader, I find Ralph Waldo Emerson's statement ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment"" to be incredibly inspiring and thought-provoking. In today's society, where conformity and following the crowd are often encouraged, Emerson's words serve as a powerful reminder of the importance of exploring new areas and challenging oneself to grow both personally and professionally.

One of the most significant ways in which Emerson's statement applies to various professions is through the concept of innovation. In order to stay ahead of the curve and make groundbreaking discoveries, professionals must be willing to venture into uncharted territory and challenge the status quo. For instance, scientists and researchers must be willing to take risks and explore new ideas in order to make new breakthroughs. Similarly, entrepreneurs must be willing to think outside the box and try new approaches in order to create innovative products and services.

However, it is important to note that professional sports players are an exception to the rule when it comes to Emerson's statement. While they must also be willing to challenge themselves and push their limits in order to excel in their field, they are often subject to intense scrutiny and pressure to conform to certain expectations. For example, professional athletes may be expected to adhere to strict training regimens and diets in order to maintain their physical fitness and performance, which can limit their ability to explore new areas and pursue other passions.

In contrast, other cases where people are challenged to leave their comfort zone for growth include pursuing a new hobby or interest, such as learning a new language or instrument. By stepping outside of their comfort zone, individuals can discover new talents and abilities, and develop a greater sense of self-awareness and confidence. Additionally, traveling to new places and experiencing different cultures can also help individuals to grow and develop by exposing them to new ideas and perspectives.

In conclusion, Emerson's statement highlights the importance of exploring new areas and challenging oneself in order to achieve personal and professional growth. While professional sports players may be an exception to the rule, the statement applies to various professions and aspects of life",1,0.99457127,1,True

For example, Apple Co-founder Steve Jobs was famously fired from the company he helped build, only to return and lead it to even greater success. His famous quote, “sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick,” serves as a reminder that failure is a necessary challenge to encounter when striving for greater success. 

This essay aims to address how failure can ultimately be a key element to achieving success. By exploring specific real-world examples of prominent successful individuals, exploring the relationship between failure and success, and looking at my own life experiences, I will demonstrate that experiencing failure can be an essential step towards success. 

First, by looking at the lives of prominent successful individuals, we can see the role of failure in their success. From Elon Musk to Oprah Winfrey, there are countless stories of individuals who have failed on their paths to becoming global success stories. And not just small setbacks – individuals like Thomas Edison, for example, demonstrated the huge leaps of progress that can made from grappling with mistakes, which ultimately became the foundation for some of his most impressive accomplishments. 

We can also look at the relationship between failure and success in our own lives. I, for one, have experienced numerous failures while working towards a goal. In particular, while preparing for my college entrance exams, I was faced with many challenges and failed the first few tests. It was not until I looked at the mistakes I made that I could understand what I was doing wrong and make necessary changes in my studying approach.

He thought that people should be constantly striving to improve themselves and their surroundings, and that idleness leads to laziness and decay.  Like, I get that. I mean, I don't want to be lazy either! But, I don't know if I agree with him on everything.

First off, let's talk about working alone.  It's like, when you're working by yourself, you can take your time and really focus on the task at hand.

If you only ask one person, you might be getting a biased opinion, or one that's not even relevant to your decision. For example, if you're trying to decide on a college major, asking only one person who's majored in that field might not give you the whole picture. You might want to ask someone who's majored in a different field, or even someone who's not in college at all, to get a different perspective.

Another reason why asking multiple people for their opinions is helpful is that it can help you build trust. When you ask someone for their opinion, they feel like you value their input, and that can strengthen your relationship with them. Plus, if you're not sure who to ask, you can always ask a teacher or a counselor, they might have some good advice.

Okay, so how can we find someone with reliable advice? Well, you can start by asking people you trust, like your parents or your closest friends. They might have some good insights, and they're definitely people you can rely on. You can also ask people who have experience in the area you're trying to make a decision about. Like, if you're trying to decide on a new phone, you might want to ask someone who's really into tech stuff.

In conclusion, seeking multiple opinions is a great way to make informed decisions. It helps you get a more well-rounded view of the situation, and it can help you build trust with the people you're asking. So, next time you're trying to make a choice",1,0.9942378,1,True
CFD0D13D3180,"Failure to Failure Equals Success: Exploring Examples of Resilience

As the saying goes, ""failure to failure equals success."" This concept may seem counterintuitive at first, but it highlights the importance of perseverance and resilience in the face of adversity. Throughout history, there have been countless examples of individuals who have found success despite failing multiple times. In this essay, I will explore some of these examples and analyze what made their journeys to success so remarkable.

One such example is Thomas Edison, the inventor of the light bulb. Edison is famously quoted as saying, ""I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."" Despite his numerous failures in creating a working light bulb, Edison remained determined and continued to experiment until he finally succeeded. His persistence and resilience are a testament to the power of failure to lead to success.

Another example is J.K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter series. Rowling was rejected by 12 publishers before one finally agreed to publish her book. Today, the Harry Potter series is one of the best-selling book series of all time, but Rowling's initial failure to secure a publisher could have been a major setback. Instead, she used it as an opportunity to hone her craft and continue writing, leading to her ultimate success.

A third example is Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple. Jobs was fired from Apple in the mid-1980s, but he didn't let this setback hold him back. Instead, he went on to found NeXT, a computer company that eventually merged with Apple, leading to Jobs' return to the company he co-founded. Under Jobs' leadership, Apple became one of the most successful technology companies in the world.

These examples demonstrate the power of failure to lead to success. Rather than viewing failure as a negative outcome, these individuals embraced it as an opportunity to learn and grow. They persevered in the face of adversity, and their determination ultimately led to their success.

As an 8th grader, I think it's pretty cool that we get to learn from the comfort of our own homes. I mean, who doesn't love lounging in their pajamas while consuming knowledge?  But, there are pros and cons to this whole ""attending classes from home"" thing. Let me tell you why.

First off, let's talk about the advantages. For instance, if you're feeling super sick or have a family emergency, you can just stay in bed and attend class from there! No need to worry about missing a bunch of schoolwork or falling behind. Plus, you can set your own schedule and learn at your own pace. That's pretty neat, right? 

Now, let's talk about an example. My friend Sarah has been attending classes from home for the past few weeks because she has a chronic illness. She says it's way easier to just stay in bed and learn from there, rather than trying to make it to school every day. And you know what? She's actually been doing really well in her classes! She's been able to focus more and get more done without the distractions of a traditional classroom. 

But, there are also some downsides. Like, sometimes it can be hard to stay motivated and focused when you're learning from home. You don't have those cool teachers and classmates to keep you on track. And, let's be real, it can be super easy to get distracted by Netflix or your favorite video game. 

However, there are definitely times when attending classes from home can be beneficial. Like, if you're an early bird and you're way more productive in the morning, you can attend classes from home before school starts. Or, if you have a lot of extracurriculars and can't make it to school during the day, you can attend classes from home after school. It's like, super flexible!

In today's society, it's easy to get caught up in the desire to fit in and be like everyone else. However, being unapologetically yourself is what sets you apart and can lead to success. One famous individual who has achieved greatness by being true to themselves is Oprah Winfrey.

Oprah is unique in many ways, but one of her most notable qualities is her ability to connect with people from all walks of life. She has a natural talent for understanding and empathizing with others, which has allowed her to build strong relationships and create a successful career. Additionally, Oprah is not afraid to be vulnerable and share her personal struggles with her audience. This honesty has allowed her to build trust and credibility with her fans, which has led to her success as a media mogul.

While it may be tempting to try to be like someone else, especially if they are successful, it's important to remember that everyone has their own unique path in life. Trying to be someone else can lead to feelings of inauthenticity and unhappiness. On the other hand, following the crowd can lead to conformity and a lack of individuality. It's important to find your own way and not be afraid to be different.

Author Waldo Emerson once said, ""Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail."" This advice highlights the importance of being yourself and not following the crowd. Emerson believed that true success comes from finding your own path and being true to your values and beliefs.

To attain this level of authenticity, it's important to start by reflecting on your own values and beliefs. What is important to you? What do you stand for? Once you have a clear understanding of your own identity, you can begin to live your life in a way that is true to yourself. This may mean taking risks and stepping outside of your comfort zone, but the rewards of true authenticity are worth it.

A83B38711F26,"The Importance of Providing Adequate Time for School in Conserving Energy and Resources

In recent years, there has been a growing concern about the impact of schools on the environment. One of the most significant factors contributing to this issue is the amount of time students spend in school. While it may seem counterintuitive, providing adequate time for school can actually help conserve energy and resources. In this essay, we will explore the benefits of more school days and the drawbacks of fewer school days.

Firstly, more school days can lead to a reduction in energy consumption. When students are in school, they are typically more engaged in learning activities. This means that they are using less energy to entertain themselves or perform other activities outside of school. Additionally, schools often have energy-efficient systems in place, such as LED lighting and HVAC systems, which can help reduce energy consumption. By increasing the amount of time students spend in school, we can potentially conserve significant amounts of energy.

However, there are also drawbacks to providing more school days. One of the most significant concerns is the impact on students' mental health. Studies have shown that students who attend school for longer periods of time are more likely to experience stress, anxiety, and other mental health issues. This can be particularly problematic for students who are already struggling with these issues. Additionally, more school days can also lead to a reduction in extracurricular activities, which can be beneficial for students' social and emotional development.

On the other hand, fewer school days can have a positive impact on the environment. By reducing the amount of time students spend in school, we can potentially conserve energy and resources. This is because students are less likely to be engaged in learning activities and more likely to be using energy to entertain themselves or perform other activities outside of school. Additionally, fewer school days can also lead to a reduction in transportation-related emissions, as students are less likely to be commuting to school.

However, there are also drawbacks to providing fewer school days. One of the most significant concerns is the impact on students' academic performance. Studies have shown that students who attend school for fewer periods of time are more likely to fall behind in their studies. This can be particularly problematic for students who are already struggling academically.

DCE82F61BE10,"With the rise of digital technologies, online courses offer unparalleled flexibility to students of all ages. On the upside, online courses offer the convenience of being able to access course material any time of day and from anywhere. They are generally more affordable than traditional classes since tuition fees are often lower, and they don’t require students to pay additional fees for resources such as textbooks, materials, or transportation. In addition, the amount of time required to complete online courses is generally shorter than it would be for in-person courses. 

However, there is one big downside to online courses – limited social interaction. While online courses offer students the ability to interact with their peers and instructors through emails, forums, and chat rooms, these interactions can feel impersonal and shallow compared to the interactive nature of face-to-face learning. 

On the other hand, attending traditional classes at a school allows for a much more rich social environment. Through in-person learning, students have the opportunity to engage directly with instructors and ask questions as needed, formstudy groups, and participate in activities and field trips. Also, by attending traditional classes, students gain invaluable professional experience that will increase their exposure and help them build their resume. 

When it comes to the financial investment, attending traditional classes could cost more upfront due to tuition fees, materials, and other costs. However, the payoffs could potentially be higher if the student decides to pursue a career in the field covered by that particular course. On the other hand, with online courses, the initial, upfront cost might be lower. However, students should remember that they will need to invest in reliable internet access in order to successfully complete the course. 

Ultimately, the decision about whether to choose online courses or attend traditional classes at a school depends on individual preferences and financial situations.

On the one hand, following someone else's agreement can provide a sense of structure and guidance, which can be beneficial for personal growth. On the other hand, following someone else's agreement can limit individuality and creativity, which can hinder personal growth.

One example of the positive consequences of following someone else's agreement is when it comes to fitness and nutrition. Many people find it helpful to follow a specific diet or exercise plan that has been proven to be effective. By following someone else's agreement, individuals can gain knowledge and guidance on how to achieve their fitness goals. This can lead to improved health and well-being, which can positively impact other areas of life.

However, following someone else's agreement can also limit individuality and creativity. For example, if someone follows a specific workout or diet plan without considering their own unique needs and preferences, they may find it difficult to stick to the plan in the long run. Additionally, following someone else's agreement can lead to a lack of self-discovery and personal growth. If individuals do not learn how to make their own decisions and take ownership of their choices, they may struggle to develop their own unique identity and values.

In conclusion, while following someone else's agreement can provide structure and guidance, it is important to balance this with individuality and creativity. By considering one's own unique needs and preferences, individuals can develop a personalized plan that will lead to sustainable growth and development.",1,0.99445313,1,True
B7626C8D1FAB,"Title: My Dream Career: Becoming a Software Engineer

As an 8th grader, I'm constantly thinking about my future career path. I've always been fascinated by technology and coding, and I know that software engineering is a field that offers a lot of opportunities for growth and success. In this essay, I'll share my research on what it's like to be a software engineer, how much they make, and the advice I've received from my parents, older siblings, and counselors.

First, let's talk about the job itself. Software engineers design, develop, and test software programs for a wide range of applications, from video games to mobile apps to operating systems. They work with a team of developers to identify user needs and turn them into functional software products. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual salary for software engineers is around $110,000, which is way higher than the national average for all occupations. That's definitely a good reason to consider this career path!

I've also talked to people who have already pursued a career in software engineering. My older brother, who works as a software engineer at a tech company, told me that his job involves a lot of problem-solving and critical thinking. He said that he loves the challenge of finding creative solutions to complex problems, and that he's constantly learning new things. He also mentioned that the job can be demanding at times, but the sense of fulfillment he gets from creating something that people use every day is worth it.

My parents have also given me some valuable advice when it comes to pursuing a career in software engineering. They told me that it's important to have a strong foundation in math and computer science, and to keep practicing my coding skills. They also reminded me that it's okay to make mistakes and to learn from them. They said that failure is a normal part of the learning process, and that it's important to be resilient and persistent.

In addition to talking to my brother and parents, I've also done some research at the library. I read a book called ""Software Engineering: A Practitioner's Approach"" by Roger S. Pressman, which gave me a deeper understanding of the field",1,0.992683,1,True

They offer a flexible and convenient way to learn, especially for those who have busy schedules or live in remote areas. However, there are also some drawbacks to taking classes online. In this essay, I will discuss the pros and cons of taking classes online, including how it affects students of different ages.

One of the biggest advantages of online classes is the flexibility they offer. Students can take classes from anywhere with an internet connection, which is especially helpful for those who have busy schedules or live in remote areas. For example, a student who has to work full-time to support their family may not have the time to attend traditional classes during the day. With online classes, they can take classes in the evening or on the weekends, when they have more free time.

Another advantage of online classes is the cost savings. Tuition for online classes is often lower than for traditional classes, which can be a big advantage for students who are on a tight budget. Additionally, online classes often include access to digital materials and resources, which can save money on textbooks and other materials.

However, there are also some disadvantages to taking classes online. One of the biggest drawbacks is the lack of face-to-face interaction with the instructor and other students. This can make it harder to ask questions and get help when you need it. Additionally, online classes can be isolating, which can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection from the rest of the student body.

Another disadvantage of online classes is the lack of structure. Without a set schedule, it can be easy to fall behind or lose motivation. This can be especially true for younger students, who may need the structure and routine of a traditional classroom to stay on track.

Finally, online classes can be less effective for some students, especially those who are visual learners. Without the benefit of a physical classroom, it can be harder to stay engaged and focused. Additionally, the lack of visual aids and hands-on activities can make it harder to learn and retain information.

F2649F7F089F,"The political implications of naturalization of citizens from foreign countries are complex. John Lubbock's writings explain that naturalization can present economic, voting, and language issues for citizens that immigrate from other countries. Naturalization can provide opportunities for citizens from other countries to find better employment, earn more money, and gain access to the voting booth, allowing them to affect change in their new nation.

However, naturalization can also contribute to instability in the societies of newly naturalized citizens as they adjust to new cultures and laws. One issue that has been linked to naturalization is the sale and purchase of guns on the street. Studies have shown that gun activity tends to increase in
communities with high naturalization rates, especially among young adults. This suggests that gun laws might need to be more strictly enforced or modified as immigrants become naturalized citizens.

Overall, it is clear that the political implications of naturalization can be complex and far reaching. Naturalization provides numerous opportunities for citizens from other countries but also brings with it a number of potential challenges. We must study the issue of gun control in relation to naturalization and consider how laws and policies might need to be adjusted in order to ensure that naturalization not only benefits the newly naturalized citizens, but also their new communities.",1,0.9943381,1,True
falcon_180b_v1_820,"""Social media has become an integral part of our lives, but it is a topic of ongoing debate whether it has significant impact on societal norms and values or not. I strongly believe that social media does have a considerable impact on society.

Firstly, social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc., have revolutionized the way we communicate and interact with each other. They provide us with an easy and efficient way to share our thoughts, opinions, and experiences with others. This increased connectivity has led to the formation of online communities where people from different parts of the world can come together and discuss various issues. These discussions often lead to the formation of new ideas and beliefs, which can influence societal norms and values.

For example, the #MeToo movement started as a hashtag on social media and quickly spread across the globe, bringing attention to the issue of sexual harassment and assault. The movement challenged existing societal norms regarding acceptable behavior towards women and led to changes in laws and policies in many countries.

Secondly, social media plays a crucial role in shaping our perceptions and attitudes towards various topics. The content we consume on these platforms can significantly impact our beliefs and values. For instance, if someone constantly sees posts promoting body positivity, they are more likely to develop a positive attitude towards their own body image.

However, this also means that negative content, such as hate speech or misinformation, can easily spread through social media, potentially influencing people's perceptions and attitudes in harmful ways. This was evident during the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election, where false information spread rapidly on social media, potentially influencing the outcome of the election.

Lastly, social media has also changed the way businesses operate and market their products. Companies now rely heavily on social media influencers to promote their brands and products. These influencers often set trends and create new standards of beauty, fashion, and lifestyle, which can significantly impact societal norms and values.

In conclusion, social media does have a significant impact on societal norms and values. It provides a platform for discussions, shapes our perceptions and attitudes, and influences trends and standards set by influencers. While it can be used positively to bring about change, it is essential to be aware of its potential negative effects and use it responsibly.""",1,0.99464875,1,True

I think we should not have a four-day school week with two extra hours of school each day. I know some people think it would be good because it would give us more time to learn and do things we like, but I don't think it's a good idea.

First, having two extra hours of school each day would be really hard for me and my friends. We would have to wake up early and stay up late, and it would be hard to keep up with our homework and other things we have to do. Plus, we would have to find something to do with all that extra time, and I don't know what we would do.

Second, I think it would be unfair to some students. Some kids have a lot of responsibilities at home, like taking care of little siblings or helping out with the family business. They wouldn't be able to do that if they had to go to school for two extra hours each day. And some kids don't have as much free time as other kids, so they might not be able to do extra things they want to do.

Third, I don't think we would learn as much if we had a four-day school week. We would have to cram all our learning into those extra two hours, and that would be hard. Plus, we might not be able to focus as well because we would be so tired from having to go to school for longer.

Finally, I think it would be bad for our social lives. We would have to spend more time at school, which would mean we would see our friends less. And we wouldn't have as much time to hang out with them outside of school.

In conclusion, I think having a four-day school week with two extra hours of school each day is not a good idea. It would be hard for some students, unfair, and bad for our learning and social lives.

Additionally, attending school provides students with the opportunity to meet new people and make lifelong friends.

However, for some students, prioritizing education can be difficult. There may be various reasons why this is the case, such as financial difficulties, family obligations, or personal challenges.

6BFDA0FE1CB2,"The concept of people trying to become someone else rather than remaining true to themselves is a common phenomenon in society. It is a phenomenon that can be seen in various aspects of life, from personal relationships to professional careers. In this essay, I will discuss the ways in which people attempt to become someone else in order to please society, the consequences of hiding one's true identity, and the importance of remaining true to oneself. I will also explore examples of people who have remained true to themselves in the face of societal pressure, and cite a quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson on the topic.

One of the main ways in which people attempt to become someone else is by conforming to societal expectations. This can be seen in various aspects of life, such as personal relationships, career choices, and even personal beliefs. For example, many people feel pressure to conform to societal expectations of beauty, fashion, and body image, which can lead them to try to become someone else in order to fit in with the norms of their society. Similarly, in the workplace, people may feel pressure to conform to the expectations of their colleagues or superiors, which can lead them to try to become someone else in order to be successful in their careers.

The consequences of hiding one's true identity can be severe. When people try to become someone else, they often lose touch with their own values and beliefs, which can lead to feelings of emptiness, confusion, and dissatisfaction. Additionally, hiding one's true identity can lead to a lack of authenticity in personal relationships, which can damage trust and intimacy. Furthermore, when people try to become someone else, they may miss out on the opportunities and experiences that come with being true to oneself.

Despite the pressure to conform to societal expectations, there are many examples of people who have remained true to themselves. One such example is the civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. King Jr. was a Baptist minister who fought for racial equality and justice in the United States. Despite facing immense pressure from society to conform to the norms of his time, King Jr. remained true to his beliefs and values, and his leadership and activism had a profound impact on American society.

Additionally, individuals have a better understanding of their own strengths and weaknesses, which can be crucial in making decisions.

Secondly, experts may not always have the best interests of the individual in mind. Experts may be motivated by their own interests or the interests of their clients, rather than the individual. For example, a financial advisor may recommend a certain investment that benefits their clients, but may not be the best option for the individual.

Thirdly, relying on the guidance of experts can lead to negative outcomes. For example, in the medical field, doctors may prescribe medication that has negative side effects on the individual, but may not be aware of the potential negative outcomes. Additionally, experts may not always have the most up-to-date information, which can lead to outdated advice.

In conclusion, people should make their own decisions instead of relying on the guidance of experts. Individuals have a unique perspective on their own lives, experts may not always have the best interests of the individual in mind, and relying on the guidance of experts can lead to negative outcomes. By making their own decisions, individuals can better understand their own values, goals, and strengths, and can make decisions that are in their best interest.",1,0.9944165,1,True
llama_70b_v1541,"As a grade 12 student, I believe that adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet is a crucial step towards creating a sustainable future for our planet. The consumption of meat has severe environmental and health consequences that cannot be ignored.

Firstly, the production of meat is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. The livestock industry is responsible for more than 14% of global emissions, which is more than the entire transportation sector. Additionally, the production of meat requires large amounts of water and land, leading to deforestation and habitat destruction. By adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet, we can significantly reduce our carbon footprint and help combat climate change.

Secondly, a plant-based diet has numerous health benefits. A study by the American Heart Association found that vegetarians have a 12% lower risk of death from heart disease compared to meat-eaters. Vegetarianism has also been linked to a lower risk of cancer, diabetes, and obesity. This is because plant-based diets are typically high in fiber, vitamins, and minerals, and low in saturated fats and cholesterol.

Furthermore, adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet can help reduce animal suffering. Factory farming, which is the dominant method of meat production, involves keeping animals in inhumane conditions and subjecting them to painful and stressful practices such as beak trimming, tail docking, and castration. By choosing plant-based options, we can help reduce the demand for meat and support more humane and sustainable farming practices.

Some argue that meat is a necessary source of protein and essential nutrients. However, this is not the case. Plant-based sources of protein include beans, lentils, tofu, and tempeh, which are not only nutritious but also more environmentally friendly than meat. Additionally, plant-based milk alternatives like soy milk and almond milk are rich in calcium and vitamins, making them a suitable replacement for dairy products.

In conclusion, adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet is a responsible and ethical choice that can help mitigate the negative impacts of meat consumption on the environment and human health. While some may argue that meat is a necessary part of a balanced diet, the benefits of a plant-based diet far outweigh the drawbacks. As a society, it is our responsibility to make conscious choices that promote sustainability and animal welfare, and adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet is a simple yet effective way to do so.",1,0.99360895,1,True
C41DFE052637,"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that trying new things is crucial for personal growth and development. It is easy to get stuck in our comfort zones and never challenge ourselves, but this can lead to a lack of progress and growth. In this essay, I will explore the benefits of trying new things and why it is best to step out of our comfort zones and embrace new experiences.

Firstly, trying new things can help us discover new talents and skills that we may not have known about. When we try something new, we are forced to explore new areas of interest and potentially discover new passions. For example, if you have never tried playing a musical instrument before, you may discover that you have a natural talent for it. This can lead to a sense of accomplishment and fulfillment that you may not have experienced before.

Secondly, trying new things can help us improve our abilities and skills. When we step out of our comfort zones, we are exposed to new challenges and obstacles that force us to think creatively and develop new strategies. This can lead to a better understanding of the subject matter and improved performance. For example, if you have never tried public speaking before, you may discover that you have a natural talent for it and improve your public speaking skills.

Finally, trying new things can help us strengthen our character and resilience. When we step out of our comfort zones, we are forced to confront our fears and insecurities. This can lead to a greater sense of self-awareness and resilience. For example, if you have never tried bungee jumping before, you may discover that you are braver than you thought and develop a greater sense of self-confidence.

In conclusion, trying new things is crucial for personal growth and development. It can help us discover new talents and skills, improve our abilities and skills, and strengthen our character and resilience. It is easy to get stuck in our comfort zones, but it is best to step out of them and embrace new experiences. So, the next time you are presented with an opportunity to try something new, don't be afraid to take the leap and discover all that you have to offer.",1,0.9944207,1,True
B9DABCFD687D,"In recent years, online classes have become increasingly popular among high school students. While some may argue that traditional classroom learning is better, taking online classes has several benefits that can help students graduate earlier and pursue further education or career paths.

One of the main benefits of online classes is flexibility. Students can take classes at their own pace, which means they can complete coursework faster than they would in a traditional classroom setting. This can be especially beneficial for students who are juggling other commitments, such as sports or extracurricular activities. Additionally, online classes often offer a variety of course options, so students can choose the courses that best fit their interests and career goals.

Another benefit of online classes is convenience. Students can complete coursework from the comfort of their own home, which means they don't have to worry about commuting to and from school. This can save students time and money, and it can also reduce stress levels. Additionally, online classes often offer 24/7 access to course materials and resources, which means students can learn at their own pace and on their own schedule.

Taking online classes can also help students save money. Traditional classroom learning can be expensive, especially if students have to pay for tuition, textbooks, and transportation. Online classes, on the other hand, are often less expensive, and students can save money by completing coursework from home. Additionally, online classes often offer the same level of accreditation as traditional classroom learning, which means students can still pursue further education or career paths after graduation.

In conclusion, taking online classes during high school has several benefits that can help students graduate earlier and pursue further education or career paths. Online classes offer flexibility, convenience, and cost savings, and they can help students complete coursework at their own pace. While traditional classroom learning may have its advantages, the benefits of online classes make it a viable option for many high school students.",1,0.9941948,1,True

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College system and to argue against changing to a popular vote for the election of the President of the United States. While I understand that there are valid concerns about the Electoral College, I believe that it serves an important purpose in our democracy.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome. As stated in the text by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of the electoral vote invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that disputes over the outcome of an Electoral College vote are less likely than disputes over the popular vote. In fact, a tie in the nationwide electoral vote, although possible, is highly unlikely due to the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes in most states.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system ensures that the president has trans-regional appeal. No single region of the country has enough electoral votes to elect a president, which means that candidates must have broader appeal and address concerns of voters from different regions. By requiring a candidate to have support from various regions, the Electoral College prevents a candidate with only regional appeal from becoming president, which would likely result in a feeling of disenfranchisement among residents of other regions.

The system is also beneficial in focusing campaign efforts on swing states. As mentioned in the text, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to focus their campaigns on states where the outcome is uncertain. This ensures that voters in these states pay close attention to the candidates and make informed decisions about their vote. These thoughtful voters, who often receive the most information and attention from the candidates, should be the ones to decide the election.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it provides a balance of power between large and small states. The mal-apportionment of the Senate, as decreed in the Constitution, gives small states an advantage in terms of representation. By allocating electoral votes based on population, the Electoral College restores some weight to larger states in the political balance. The popularity of a candidate in a large state can influence the outcome of the election to a greater extent than in a small state, ensuring that the concerns of residents in these larger states are not overlooked.

Lastly, the Electoral College system helps avoid run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, the Electoral College ensures that a clear winner emerges. This eliminates the need for further complicated run-off elections, streamlining the presidential election process.

While critics argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters for candidates who have no hope of carrying their state, the fact remains that a significant portion of the eligible population still votes in presidential elections. People participate not because they believe their single vote will swing the entire election, but because they want to express their political preference.

In conclusion, the Electoral College plays a crucial role in our democracy and should be retained. It ensures certainty of outcome, requires candidates to have trans-regional appeal, focuses campaign efforts on swing states, provides a balance of power between large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While improvements can always be made, changing to a popular vote system would have its own set of challenges and unintended consequences. Therefore, I urge you to support the continuation of the Electoral College system.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will carefully consider the arguments presented and make an informed decision.

llama_70b_v1249,"Zoos are a place where animals are kept for display and study. Some people say that zoos are good for conservation and education, but others say that they are cruel and unjust. In my opinion, zoos are not worth it.

First of all, zoos are not a natural environment for animals. They are kept in small enclosures, away from their natural habitats and social groups. This can lead to stress, boredom, and aggression in animals. For example, in 2016, a gorilla named Harambe was killed at the Cincinnati Zoo after he became aggressive and tried to escape. This shows that zoos are not a suitable place for animals.

Secondly, zoos are not effective in conserving species. Many zoos prioritize entertainment over conservation and education. They focus on displaying popular animals, rather than those that are endangered. For example, the Toronto Zoo has a large collection of penguins, but they are not an endangered species. This means that resources are being wasted on animals that do not need help.

Furthermore, zoos can be harmful to animals. They are often subjected to unnatural conditions, such as artificial lighting, temperature control, and lack of space. This can lead to health problems and shorter lifespans. For example, a study by the Born Free Foundation found that zoo elephants have a much shorter lifespan than wild elephants.

Finally, zoos can also be harmful to visitors. They can spread diseases, such as EEHV, which is a virus that affects elephants. In 2019, a baby elephant at the Toronto Zoo died from EEHV. This shows that zoos can be dangerous for both animals and humans.

In conclusion, zoos are not worth it. They are not a natural environment for animals, they are not effective in conserving species, they can be harmful to animals, and they can be harmful to visitors. Instead of zoos, we should focus on protecting animals in their natural habitats and supporting conservation efforts. This can be done through donations, volunteering, and raising awareness about the importance of conservation.

A8D0ADC676C0,"As an eighth-grade student, I have learned the importance of seeking multiple opinions when making decisions. In my experience, seeking multiple opinions can help me make better decisions by preventing poor choices, determining which advice is accurate, and helping to ensure comfort with decisions.

Firstly, seeking multiple opinions can help me prevent poor choices. When I seek out different perspectives, I am able to consider a variety of factors that may not have been immediately apparent to me. This allows me to make more informed decisions and avoid choices that may have negative consequences. For example, if I am deciding on a new hobby, seeking the opinions of friends and family can help me determine which hobbies are appropriate for my interests and skill level.

Secondly, seeking multiple opinions can help me determine which advice is accurate. When I seek out different perspectives, I am able to compare and contrast the advice I receive. This allows me to determine which advice is most relevant and reliable. For example, if I am deciding on a college major, seeking the opinions of teachers, peers, and career counselors can help me determine which majors are most suitable for my interests and career goals.

Lastly, seeking multiple opinions can help me ensure comfort with my decisions. When I seek out different perspectives, I am able to gain a better understanding of the potential consequences of my decisions. This allows me to feel more confident in my choices and less likely to regret them. For example, if I am deciding on a new job opportunity, seeking the opinions of colleagues and friends can help me understand the company culture and determine if it is a good fit for me.

In conclusion, seeking multiple opinions is an important aspect of making better decisions. By preventing poor choices, determining which advice is accurate, and ensuring comfort with decisions, seeking multiple opinions can help me make more informed and confident choices. I encourage others to seek out different perspectives when making decisions, as it can lead to better outcomes and a greater sense of satisfaction.",1,0.9941176,1,True
BA6FC6ECE68E,"Hey there!  So, I've been thinking a lot about this whole ""early graduation"" thing, and I gotta say, I'm definitely on the fence about it. Like, I get it, some kids are super smart and stuff, and they wanna get a head start on college or whatever, but I think it's kinda messed up that they get to skip out on like, a whole year of high school. 

First of all, let's talk about the social aspect of it. I mean, high school is like, the best time of your life, right?  You get to make new friends, join clubs, and just, like, figure out who you are and all that jazz. If you graduate early, you're missing out on all that. And let's be real, high school is also where you learn how to deal with, like, real-life situations and stuff. You gotta learn how to work with others, how to handle conflicts, and how to just, like, be a decent human being. If you skip all that, you might end up being a total mess in college or in the real world. 

And then there's the academic side of things. Like, sure, some kids might be super smart and can handle college-level work in high school, but most of us, well, we need that extra year to really solidify our understanding of the material. I mean, I'm still trying to wrap my head around algebra, and if I were to graduate early, I'd be like, totally lost in college.  And let's not forget about the extracurriculars. I mean, sports, clubs, and volunteer work are all super important for, like, building your resume and stuff. If you graduate early, you're missing out on all that too.

Now, I know some people might be like, ""But what about the kids who are really smart and wanna get a head start on college?""

C616874461F9,"Working alone or working in a group provides different benefits to student learning. Working alone can provide a student with the distraction-free environment needed to focus and concentrate on a task or assignment. However, working in a group can stimulate a student's creativity and collaboration skills, allowing for a deeper understanding of difficult topics.

When working alone, a student can benefit from undivided attention and full focus on the task at hand. Working alone will also give a student the liberty to use new strategies which would allow them to work through obstacles in their own way. Also, through self-paced learning, the student can gain a sense of fulfillment and accomplishment over the work they have put into completing the task.

On the other hand, when students work in a group, they can take advantage of being able to brainstorm. Students can work together to generate ideas and come up with solutions, usually leading to a deeper understanding of a subject which wouldn’t have been reached when working alone. Working in a group setting can also provide a student with instant feedback from their peers, leading to an improved understanding of the subject being discussed.

In conclusion, both working alone and in a group have their own set of advantages, and each student should take into consideration their own working style when deciding which is best for them. Working alone provides undivided attention and fits better with some student’s learning strategies, while working in a group encourages collaboration and group think which will undoubtedly benefit the student in the long run.",1,0.9946219,1,True
C5E45F477A84,"Hey, it's me, your average 8th grade student! 😅

First impressions are like, super important, right? Like, you know, when you meet someone new and you get that one chance to make a good impression. But, like, what happens when that first impression is totally off? Like, what if you come across as super boring or weird? Can you change that first impression, or is it like, set in stone? 💔

So, I think first impressions are kind of like, impossible to change. Like, once you make that first impression, it's out there and it's hard to take it back. For example, if you show up late to a party and you're all sweaty and out of breath, it's gonna be hard to change that first impression. People are gonna think you're, like, irresponsible or something. 🙄

But, on the other hand, sometimes first impressions can be changed. Like, if you show up to a job interview super early and dressed to impress, people might think you're super eager and motivated. Or, if you're in a new social situation and you're able to, like, quickly make someone laugh or something, it can change that first impression. 😂

So, it's like, kind of a mix of both. First impressions are hard to change, but they can also be changed if you, like, put in the effort. It's important to be aware of that first impression and try to make a good one, or at least a good enough one that you can build on it later. 🤔

In conclusion, first impressions are like, a big deal. They can make or break how people see you, and it's important to be mindful of them. But, it's also important to remember that they're not always set in stone, and you can always try to change them if you want to. 😃

falcon_180b_v1_889,"Dear Principal,

I am writing to you to express my thoughts on the school's cell phone policy. I believe that the school should adopt policy 1, which allows students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.

Firstly, having a cell phone is important for emergencies. If there is an emergency, such as a student getting hurt or a family emergency, students can quickly contact their parents or emergency services. This can help keep students safe and ensure that they receive the help they need in a timely manner.

Secondly, many students rely on their phones for communication. For example, some students may need to contact their parents to arrange for a ride home or to let them know that they will be late. Additionally, some students may need to communicate with their teachers or classmates about schoolwork or projects. Allowing students to use their phones during lunch periods and other free times can help facilitate this communication.

Finally, having a cell phone can promote responsibility and trust. If students are allowed to have phones at school, they will be responsible for keeping them safe and not using them during class time. This can help build trust between students and teachers, as it shows that students are capable of following rules and being responsible.

I understand that some people may argue that cell phones can be a distraction during class time. However, policy 1 addresses this issue by requiring students to turn off their phones during class time. This ensures that students are not distracted by their phones and can focus on their studies.

In conclusion, I believe that policy 1 is the better choice for our school's cell phone policy. It allows students to have access to their phones for emergencies and communication, while also promoting responsibility and trust. Thank you for considering my opinion on this matter.

AAF42F8A396F,"Okay, here is my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grade student:

Making a good first impression is super important. Like, really important. It can affect how people see you for the rest of your life. Think about it, when you meet someone new, you only have a few seconds to make them like you. If you come off as weird or boring, they might not want to be friends with you. But if you're funny or interesting, they'll probably want to hang out with you more.

I know this from personal experience. In 6th grade, I met this kid named Max. He was really cool and funny, and we became fast friends. But then, one day, I accidentally knocked over his lunch tray in the cafeteria. It was a total mess, and I felt so embarrassed. Max was nice about it, but I could tell he thought I was kind of clumsy. After that, he didn't want to sit with me at lunch anymore. It was super sad.

But then, I started working on making a better first impression. I practiced being more careful and paying attention to my surroundings. And you know what? It worked! I made some new friends, and they all thought I was really cool.

Making a good first impression can also help you in other areas of your life. Like, if you're trying to get a job or get into a good college. Employers and admissions officers want to see that you're responsible and can make a good impression on people. They don't want to take a chance on someone who might be weird or unreliable.

falcon_180b_v1_78,"The Face on Mars has been a topic of discussion for many years, with some believing that it was created by aliens while others believe it to be a natural formation. However, the evidence suggests that the Face is just a natural landform, and there are numerous reasons to support this claim.

Firstly, it is important to consider the size and shape of the Face as well as its location. The Face appears to be a large mesa that is located on the Cydonia region of Mars, and it has an unusual shape that resembles a human face. However, the shape of the Face could simply be a product of geological activity on the planet, such as erosion or wind patterns.

Secondly, the article 'Unmasking the Face on Mars' states that the Face was first photographed by the Viking spacecraft in 1976, and subsequent missions to Mars have captured images of the Face in greater detail. These images have allowed scientists to study the Face more closely, and they have found that there is no evidence to suggest that the Face is an alien structure. Rather, it appears to be a natural formation that has been shaped by geological forces over time.

Furthermore, the article points out that the Face is just one of many unusual formations that can be found on Mars. There are also other formations that resemble human-made structures, such as pyramids and canals, but these have been shown to be natural formations as well. This suggests that the Face is simply another example of the unusual geological activity that is present on Mars.

In conclusion, the evidence suggests that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform that has been shaped by geological forces over time. While it may appear to resemble a human face, this is likely due to the effects of erosion or wind patterns on the planet.

However, the use of cell phones while driving has been a topic of debate for a long time. Some people believe that it is okay to use cell phones while driving, while others strongly disagree. In this essay, I will argue that drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

Firstly, using cell phones while driving is dangerous. When drivers are talking or texting on their cell phones, they are not paying attention to the road. This distraction can cause accidents, which can be fatal. According to a study conducted by the National Safety Council, using a cell phone while driving makes drivers four times more likely to crash. This statistic alone should be enough to convince people that using cell phones while driving is not safe.

Secondly, using cell phones while driving is illegal in many places. Many countries and states have implemented laws that prohibit drivers from using cell phones while operating a vehicle. These laws are in place to protect drivers and pedestrians from accidents caused by distracted driving. If using cell phones while driving was safe, there would be no need for these laws.

Lastly, using cell phones while driving is unnecessary. If a driver needs to make a call or send a text message, they can pull over to a safe location and do so. It is not worth risking their safety or the safety of others just to make a call or send a text message.

In conclusion, drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. The use of cell phones while driving is dangerous, illegal, and unnecessary. By banning the use of cell phones while driving, we can reduce accidents and make our roads safer for everyone.",1,0.99328136,1,True
llama_70b_v11093,"The legalization of marijuana has been a topic that has been debated for a long time. Some people think it's a good idea, while others don't. In my opinion, I think it's a bad idea to legalize marijuana.

First of all, marijuana is a drug that can be harmful to your health. It can cause problems with your brain, like memory loss and difficulty with concentration. It can also lead to addiction, which can ruin people's lives. Additionally, marijuana use can increase the risk of mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety.

Secondly, legalizing marijuana can lead to more people using it, especially young people. Marijuana is already the most commonly used drug among teenagers, and legalizing it can make it even more accessible to them. This can have negative effects on their health and future.

Furthermore, legalizing marijuana can also lead to more accidents and injuries. Marijuana can impair people's judgment and reaction time, which can make it dangerous for them to drive or operate heavy machinery. This can lead to more car accidents and workplace accidents.

Another reason why marijuana should not be legalized is that it can be a gateway drug. This means that people who use marijuana are more likely to try other drugs, like cocaine or heroin. This can lead to even more problems with drug addiction and crime.

Finally, legalizing marijuana can also send the wrong message to young people. It can make them think that drug use is okay, and that it's not harmful. This can lead to more drug use and other problems in the future.

In conclusion, legalizing marijuana is not a good idea. It can be harmful to people's health, lead to more drug use and accidents, and send the wrong message to young people.

Although his family had been advising him to stay in his current field, his heart was telling him to take a chance. Despite the risks, Brad followed his intuition and made the move; he soon found himself quickly climbing the career ladder and achieving more than he had ever dreamed of.

The importance of tuning out the “voice of reason” and instead following our hearts cannot be understated. Too often we measure success within a narrow scope of what is expected of us, and we forget that what can truly make us successful is found in our personal journey. It is not uncommon to make mistakes and even encounter failure along the way, but if we use these moments to grow and gain a better understanding of ourselves, we will eventually find true success.

Overall, there is great reward in taking chances and in learning from the unexpected paths we find ourselves on.

Thomas Jefferson, one of the founding fathers of the United States, once said, ""Determine never to be idle ... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" This quote highlights the value of being constantly active and avoiding idle time. In this essay, I will discuss the benefits of staying busy and how much can be accomplished by being always doing.

Firstly, staying active helps individuals to achieve their goals and aspirations. When we are constantly working towards something, we are more likely to make progress and achieve our desired outcomes. For example, if a student wants to get good grades, they need to study regularly and complete assignments on time. By staying active and working hard, they can achieve their goal of getting good grades. Similarly, if an individual wants to become a successful entrepreneur, they need to work hard, network, and take calculated risks. By staying busy and actively working towards their goal, they can increase their chances of success.

Secondly, staying active helps individuals to develop new skills and knowledge. When we are constantly learning and growing, we become more knowledgeable and skilled. For instance, if a person wants to learn a new language, they need to practice speaking and listening regularly. By staying active and practicing, they can improve their language skills and become more proficient. Similarly, if someone wants to learn a new hobby, they need to practice and experiment with different techniques. By staying busy and actively learning, they can develop new skills and interests.

Thirdly, staying active helps individuals to stay healthy and happy. When we are constantly engaged in activities that we enjoy, we are more likely to feel happy and satisfied with our lives. For example, if a person enjoys exercising, they are more likely to feel energized and healthy. Similarly, if someone enjoys spending time with friends and family, they are more likely to feel happy and fulfilled. By staying active and engaging in activities that bring us joy, we can improve our mental and physical health.

In conclusion, staying active and never idling in life is crucial for achieving our goals, developing new skills and knowledge, and staying healthy and happy.

827D807512AB,"Winston Churchill once said, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts."" This statement highlights the importance of failure in the pursuit of success. While some people may view failure as a setback, others see it as an opportunity to learn and grow. In this essay, I will explore two examples of why not many people are a failure of their success, two examples of how many people are inspired from what they are going, and two examples of why so many people are pursuing failure.

Firstly, many people are not a failure of their success because they view failure as a stepping stone to success. For example, Thomas Edison famously failed thousands of times before he successfully invented the light bulb. Instead of giving up, Edison saw each failure as an opportunity to learn and improve his design. This mindset allowed him to eventually succeed in his endeavor. Similarly, many successful entrepreneurs, such as J.K. Rowling and Oprah Winfrey, have faced numerous failures in their careers, but have used those failures as motivation to continue and eventually succeed.

Secondly, many people are inspired by what they are going, even if they are not successful yet. For example, many aspiring athletes, musicians, and artists are inspired by the journey of their idols, even if they have not yet achieved the same level of success. These individuals see the hard work, dedication, and perseverance of their role models as a source of motivation to continue pursuing their own dreams. This shows that success is not the only measure of success, and that the journey towards success can be just as important as the destination.

On the other hand, many people are pursuing failure because they have a fear of success. For example, some people may be afraid of the responsibility that comes with success, or they may be afraid of not living up to the expectations of others. This fear can cause them to sabotage their own success or give up when faced with obstacles. Additionally, some people may be afraid of failure because they have never experienced it before. They may view failure as a sign of weakness or incompetence, and may be hesitant to take risks or try new things.

In conclusion, Winston Churchill's statement about the importance of failure in the pursuit of success is true. While some people may view failure",1,0.9943112,1,True
8C3993109983,"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that working in a group on a project can have numerous advantages. In this essay, I will explore the benefits of group work and provide evidence to support my argument.

Firstly, working in a group allows for the exchange of diverse ideas and perspectives. Each person brings their unique perspective and experiences to the table, which can lead to more creative and innovative solutions to problems. This is particularly important in projects that require a wide range of skills and knowledge. By working together, students can learn from each other and develop a deeper understanding of the subject matter.

Secondly, group work promotes collaboration and teamwork. When working in a group, students must communicate effectively and work together to achieve a common goal. This can help students develop important interpersonal skills, such as active listening, empathy, and conflict resolution. These skills are essential for success in any field and will benefit students throughout their lives.

Thirdly, group work can help students develop leadership and decision-making skills. As a group member, students must take on different roles and responsibilities, including leadership and decision-making. This can help students develop the confidence and ability to take charge in a variety of situations.

Finally, group work can be more enjoyable than working alone. When working in a group, students can share the workload and support each other through difficult tasks. This can make the project more enjoyable and less stressful.

7C2650EEA2B6,"Summer break is a time of year that many people look forward to. It's a time when students and teachers can take a break from the rigors of school and recharge their batteries. However, there are many different opinions about the importance of summer break compared to graduating early and spending time with family. In this essay, I will compare the importance of these three things and outline the pros and cons of each.

The first thing to consider is the importance of graduating early. There are many benefits to graduating early, such as being able to start your career sooner and potentially earning more money. Additionally, graduating early can give you a sense of accomplishment and pride in your achievements. However, there are also some cons to graduating early. For example, you may not have had the same opportunities to learn and grow as you would have if you had taken a more traditional four-year college path. Additionally, graduating early can be stressful, as you may feel like you have to rush to complete all of your coursework and graduate on time.

The second thing to consider is the importance of spending time with family. Spending time with family is important because it allows you to reconnect and bond with the people who are most important to you. It's a time when you can relax and enjoy each other's company without the stress of school and work. Additionally, spending time with family can be a great way to learn new skills and gain valuable life experiences. However, there are also some cons to spending too much time with family. For example, you may feel like you're missing out on other opportunities, such as traveling or pursuing your passions.

The third thing to consider is the importance of summer break. Summer break is a time when students and teachers can take a break from the rigors of school and recharge their batteries. It's a time when you can relax and enjoy the sunshine, spend time with friends, and pursue your hobbies. Additionally, summer break can be a great time to take courses and graduate early if you wish to. However, there are also some cons to summer break. For example, you may feel like you're missing out on the opportunity to learn and grow if you don't take advantage of the summer to pursue your passions. Additionally, summer break can be expensive, as you may need to pay for travel, housing, and other expenses",1,0.99451965,1,True

First off, let's talk about the benefits for students.  One thing that comes to mind is that it would help us retain what we learned during the school year. Like, think about it. We go on summer break, and before we know it, it's time to go back to school again. But if we had year-round school, we could keep learning and reviewing what we learned without having to cram everything into those few months before the break. It would be like, a constant flow of learning, you know? 

And two, it would give us more time to focus on our passions and interests.  Like, I love playing soccer, but during the school year, I don't always have time to practice as much as I want. But if we had year-round school, I could practice more and really improve my skills. Plus, it would give us more time to work on projects and stuff for our extracurriculars, which would be awesome. 

Okay, so now let me give you an example.  So, like, my school has a really cool robotics club, and we only get to work on it during the school year. But if we had year-round school, we could work on it more consistently and even enter competitions!  It would be so cool to see our hard work pay off and compete against other schools. 

And that's my argument for year-round school!  I know there are probably some downsides, but I think the benefits for students and educators are pretty significant.  What do you think? 

Oh, and one more thing!  I think year-round school could also help with bullying and social issues. *paus",1,0.9944616,1,True
llama_70b_v112,"Hi, my name's Timmy and I'm in 8th grade. We've been learning about this thing called a ""meatless movement"" in school. It's about how some people think we should all eat less meat because it's better for the Earth and our bodies. In this essay, I'm gonna tell you why I think this movement is a good idea, but also why it's not gonna work.

First off, let's talk about why eating less meat is good for the Earth. The main reason is that it helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. See, when we raise animals for food like cows, pigs, and chickens, it takes a lot of resources like water and land. And it also creates a lot of methane, which is a bad gas that hurts the environment. So, if we eat less meat, we'll have less of these emissions and it'll be better for the planet. Plus, it'll help to stop deforestation, which is when people cut down trees to make room for farms and stuff. This helps to keep the trees around, which is good for the environment too.

Now, let's talk about why eating less meat is good for our bodies. The main reason is that meat has a lot of saturated fats, which are bad for our health. These fats can give us heart disease, diabetes, and even make us fatter. And if we eat more vegetables and fruits instead, we'll get more fiber, vitamins, and stuff that's good for us. It'll help us to lose weight and feel better overall. My dad's a doctor and he always tells us to eat more veggies and fruits, so I know this is true.

Okay, now let's talk about why this movement probably won't work. The main reason is that people like meat too much! It's like, the best part of the meal for most people. And it's really hard to give up things we like. Like, I love bacon, but if I had to choose between bacon and saving the Earth, I'd pick bacon. Just kidding! But for real, people love their meat and it's gonna be hard to change their habits. Plus, there's a lot of companies that make money off of meat, so they probably won't stop making it anytime soon.

Another reason this movement might not work is that it's hard to change the way people eat without making them feel like they're missing out. Like, if we start forcing people to eat vegetarian or vegan food, they might get upset and not want to do it. People like having the freedom to choose what they want to eat. And it's hard to make vegetarian or vegan food that tastes as good as meat, so people might not want to switch.

In conclusion, while the meatless movement is a good idea, it's probably not gonna work because people love meat too much and it's hard to change their habits. But we can still try to eat less meat and more veggies and fruits to help the environment and our health. Maybe we could even try having a meatless day once a week or something. I don't know, it's worth a try!",1,0.99453694,1,True
8F78E9AF1D0E,"Michelangelo once said, ""The greatest danger for most of us is not that our aim is too high and we miss it, but that it is too low and we reach it."" This quote speaks to the challenge of setting goals in modern society. It is easy to set goals that are too easy and achieve them, but this can lead to complacency and a lack of motivation to strive for greater things. On the other hand, setting goals that are too difficult can be frustrating and lead to feelings of failure.

One way to overcome this challenge is to set easier goals and know your limits. This can be beneficial because it allows you to focus on smaller, achievable milestones and build momentum towards your larger goals. Additionally, setting easier goals can help you to gain confidence and self-esteem, which can be important in motivating you to continue working towards your goals.

An example of the frustration that can come from attempting something that is too difficult is trying to learn a new language. If you set a goal to become fluent in a language that you have never spoken before, it can be overwhelming and difficult to achieve. It may take a lot of time and effort to learn the language, and you may struggle to keep up with the pace of your progress. This can be discouraging and lead to feelings of failure.

On the other hand, setting both easy and hard goals can have different outcomes. Setting easy goals can help you to build momentum and confidence, which can inspire you to set more ambitious goals in the future. Additionally, setting hard goals can push you to work harder and strive for greater things. It can also help you to develop discipline and perseverance, which are important skills in achieving success.

In conclusion, Michelangelo's quote highlights the importance of setting goals that are challenging but achievable. Setting easy goals can help you to build momentum and confidence, while setting hard goals can push you to work harder and strive for greater things. It is important to find a balance between setting easy and hard goals in order to achieve success and reach your full potential.",1,0.9943877,1,True

Okay, so, electives. They're like, super important for high school students, you know? Like, they help us explore our interests and stuff. But, I mean, there's more to it than just that. Research shows that assigning electives can actually boost motivation, attendance, and grades. Like, whoa! 💥

First of all, let's talk about motivation. When we get to choose our own electives, it's like, super easy to lose interest. I mean, if I had to take, like, another math class, I'd totally zone out.

And grades? Oh, man. Electives can seriously boost those too. When we're engaged in what we're learning, we do better in class. It's like, common sense, right? But, like, research shows that students who take electives tend to have higher GPAs than those who don't. 📚

llama_70b_v1980,"The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a cutting-edge technology that enables computers to identify human emotions. As described in the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" this technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with computers and understand human emotions. However, the question remains whether the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable.

On the one hand, using FACS in the classroom can provide teachers with valuable insights into their students' emotional states. This information can help teachers identify students who may be struggling or feeling overwhelmed, allowing them to provide additional support and guidance. It can also help teachers assess the effectiveness of their teaching methods and make adjustments to better engage their students. Moreover, FACS can help create a more positive and inclusive learning environment by enabling teachers to recognize and address any biases or discrimination that may be present in the classroom.

On the other hand, there are several concerns surrounding the use of FACS in the classroom. Firstly, there is the issue of privacy. Students may feel uncomfortable having their facial expressions monitored and analyzed by computers, and this could potentially create a sense of mistrust and discomfort in the classroom. Additionally, there is the risk of false positives or false negatives, where the technology misinterprets a student's emotional expression or fails to recognize it altogether. This could lead to misinformation and inappropriate interventions, which could ultimately harm the student.

Furthermore, relying too heavily on FACS could lead to a lack of human interaction and empathy in the classroom. Teachers are trained to recognize and respond to their students' emotions, and this technology could potentially replace that human connection. It is important for students to feel heard and understood by their teachers, and relying solely on technology to interpret their emotions could undermine this.

In conclusion, while the use of FACS in the classroom has the potential to be valuable, it is important to consider the potential drawbacks and limitations of this technology. It is crucial to strike a balance between the benefits of FACS and the need for human interaction and empathy in the classroom. By using FACS in a responsible and nuanced way, we can create a more positive and inclusive learning environment for all students.",1,0.9945533,1,True

In recent years, the trend of taking classes online from home has become increasingly popular. While some people may argue that online learning is not as effective as traditional classroom learning, there are several advantages and disadvantages to consider. In this essay, I will explore the benefits and drawbacks of online learning, and examine different learning strategies that could be useful for home-schoolers. I will also discuss how to apply to online courses and how online courses can maximize the educational opportunities of home-schoolers. Finally, I will evaluate the cost benefit of utilizing online courses from home.

Advantages of Online Learning:

One of the biggest advantages of online learning is the flexibility it provides. Students can learn at their own pace and on their own schedule. This is particularly beneficial for home-schoolers who may have other responsibilities, such as caring for younger siblings or working a part-time job. Additionally, online learning allows students to access a wider range of courses and subjects than they may be able to find in their local area. This can be especially beneficial for students who are interested in pursuing specialized or niche subjects.

Disadvantages of Online Learning:

While online learning offers many benefits, it also has its drawbacks. One of the biggest disadvantages is the lack of interaction with other students and teachers. In a traditional classroom setting, students have the opportunity to ask questions and collaborate with their peers. This can be more difficult to achieve in an online environment, where students may feel isolated or disconnected from their classmates. Additionally, online learning requires a certain level of self-discipline and motivation, which can be challenging for some students.

Learning Strategies for Home-Schoolers:

To maximize the educational opportunities of online learning, home-schoolers should employ a variety of learning strategies. One effective strategy is to create a dedicated study space that is free from distractions. This can help students focus and be more productive. Additionally, home-schoolers should establish a routine that includes regular study time, breaks, and opportunities for physical activity. This can help maintain a healthy work-life balance and prevent burnout.

Applying to Online Courses:

Increased school days also means more rest for students, which can help promote better physical and mental health. On the other hand, there are also drawbacks to having too many school days. Students will find it difficult to juggle their academic commitments with their other obligations, such as social and family responsibilities. They may also become over-burdened with the amount of work that they must complete, leading to fatigue and potentially even lower grades.

Overall, there needs to be a balance between the importance of providing adequate time for school and the need to conserve energy and resources. Finding this balance can be difficult, but it is essential in order to ensure that students receive all of the benefits of learning without becoming overwhelmed. Ultimately, the key is to ensure that students are given enough time to learn while also respecting their other responsibilities.",1,0.9944351,1,True
776FBF88E6FF,"The debate surrounding online learning has grown in recent years with a variety of countries and schools considering it a viable educational option. However, there are some countries and schools which do not allow online learning and it is important to understand the consequences students face as a result. Technological capabilities in some of these countries may be limited which could be a contributing factor, however, it is important to note that online learning is not a viable option for all students no matter the technological capabilities of the countries in which they reside. 

The benefits of online learning compared to traditional, in-person schooling are no doubt significant. Online learning grants students much greater flexibility and allows them to engage in educational pursuits from the comfort of their own home. Additionally, online learning is often less costly than traditional in-person schooling since there are no geographic boundaries and students have access to a much larger variety of courses. 

However, online learning does come with its fair share of disadvantages. Students in traditional schooling benefit greatly from the social interaction with their peers, something which is not easily replicated in an online environment despite the advances in technology. Furthermore, the technological equipment required for an optimal online learning experience is often quite expensive. Additionally, some students may not take the online education seriously and be less likely to put in the appropriate effort needed for success. 

Finally, it is important to note that online learning can have many positive outcomes for those who are unable to attend school due to illness or other extenuating circumstances. These individuals can still take part in educational pursuits from the convenience of their own home.

llama_70b_v1986,"Cell phones have become an essential part of our daily lives, and it's not uncommon to see people using them while driving. However, the question remains whether drivers should be allowed to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. In my opinion, drivers should not be able to use cell phones while driving, and I'll explain why.

Firstly, using a cell phone while driving is a significant distraction. When we're driving, our primary focus should be on the road and the other cars around us. But when we're texting, calling, or browsing social media, our attention is diverted from the task at hand. According to statistics, texting and driving increases the risk of accidents by 23 times! That's a scary thought, especially when we consider the number of lives that could be lost or injured due to a simple text message.

Secondly, using a cell phone while driving impairs our reaction time. When we're driving, we need to be able to react quickly to unexpected situations. But if we're busy typing a message or scrolling through our feeds, we might not be able to react as quickly as we should. This could lead to accidents, and it's just not worth the risk.

Thirdly, there are already laws in place to prevent cell phone use while driving. In many states, it's illegal to text and drive, and some states have even banned hand-held phone use while driving. These laws are in place for a reason, and it's important to respect them.

Lastly, there are alternatives to using cell phones while driving. For example, we can use hands-free devices, like Bluetooth headsets or car speakers, to make and receive calls. We can also use voice-to-text features to send messages without having to physically type them. These alternatives allow us to communicate safely while still keeping our eyes on the road.

In conclusion, using cell phones while driving is a dangerous and avoidable distraction. It impairs our reaction time, increases the risk of accidents, and there are already laws in place to prevent it. There are also alternatives that allow us to communicate safely while driving. Therefore, drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. It's time for us to put safety first and keep our eyes on the road.",1,0.9941339,1,True
llama_70b_v1898,"As a high school student, I have been exposed to a plethora of information regarding the benefits of reducing meat consumption. While some argue that vegetarian or vegan diets are the way of the future, I firmly believe that adopting such a diet is not the best solution for individuals or society as a whole.

Firstly, meat is an excellent source of protein, which is essential for the human body's growth and development. A vegetarian or vegan diet often lacks the necessary amount of protein required for optimal health, leading to nutritional deficiencies and health problems. For example, a study published in the Journal of the American Osteopathic Association found that vegetarian diets are often low in vitamin B12, which is crucial for brain function and the formation of red blood cells.

Secondly, the agricultural industry is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, and reducing meat consumption would only have a minimal impact on the environment. According to a study by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, animal agriculture accounts for approximately 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions. While reducing meat consumption may help, it would not be a significant enough change to reverse the effects of climate change.

Furthermore, adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet can be costly and time-consuming. Plant-based alternatives to meat products are often more expensive, and purchasing fresh fruits and vegetables can be cost-prohibitive for many families. Additionally, preparing vegetarian or vegan meals can be time-consuming, requiring more planning and effort than a traditional meat-based diet.

Lastly, there are cultural and social implications to consider. Meat is often a central part of many cultural and religious traditions, and eliminating it from our diets could have negative impacts on cultural heritage and community. For example, in many Indigenous cultures, meat is a crucial part of traditional ceremonies and celebrations.

In conclusion, while the intentions behind the movement to reduce meat consumption are well-meaning, I do not believe that adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet is the best solution. Instead, we should focus on supporting sustainable and ethical farming practices, reducing food waste, and promoting a balanced diet that includes meat in moderation. By taking these steps, we can promote both human health and environmental sustainability.",1,0.99360657,1,True
B0CDBB24465F,"As an eighth-grade student, I strongly believe that the adoption of a 10 P.M weekday and a midnight weekend curfew for teenagers would lead to improved responsibility, decreased risk of late-night trouble, and increased family time. In this essay, I will present evidence to support my argument.

Firstly, teenagers need to learn responsibility at a young age. By setting a curfew, parents can ensure that their children are accountable for their actions and learn to manage their time effectively. A curfew would require teenagers to prioritize their responsibilities, such as homework, studying, and family time. This would help them develop important life skills that will serve them well in the future.

Secondly, a curfew would decrease the risk of late-night trouble for teenagers. Late-night activities such as partying, drug use, and vandalism can have serious consequences for teenagers, including legal trouble, injury, and even death. A curfew would limit the amount of time teenagers have to engage in these activities, reducing the risk of harm to themselves and others.

Lastly, a curfew would increase family time for teenagers. Many families struggle to find quality time together due to busy schedules and conflicting interests. By setting a curfew, parents can ensure that their teenagers are home and available to spend time with their family. This would strengthen family bonds and improve communication, leading to a more positive and supportive home environment.

In conclusion, the adoption of a 10 P.M weekday and a midnight weekend curfew for teenagers would lead to improved responsibility, decreased risk of late-night trouble, and increased family time. As an eighth-grade student, I urge parents and policymakers to consider this proposal and take action to keep our teenagers safe and healthy.",1,0.9945075,1,True

Educators are exploring ways to use cell phones as a learning tool in the classroom, as they can provide a great and convenient way to engage students in learning. Proponents of using cell phones in the classroom argue that cell phones can be used to access online educational resources, to aid in learning in real time, and to facilitate communication and collaboration among students. 

At the same time, there are some potential drawbacks to using cell phones in the classroom. They can be distracting to students and take away from time that could be used for more traditional learning activities. Some research has also suggested that using cell phones in the classroom can lead to decreased classroom engagement and learning, as students are more likely to become distracted by texting and social media. 

In my opinion, using cell phones in the classroom can be beneficial as a supplement to traditional learning activities, provided that they are used properly and monitored appropriately by educators. Cell phones can provide an engaging and convenient way for students to acquire knowledge in a digital world, but ultimately the teacher needs to make sure that cell phone use does not disrupt the learning process.",1,0.9946084,1,True

CE43DBA12965,"As an 8th grader, I have witnessed the rapid growth of technology and its impact on people's lives. One of the most significant advantages of technology is the rise of online education. My brother, for instance, was able to take online courses during his senior year of high school, which helped him to graduate early and start college earlier than his peers. This flexibility allowed him to take classes that interested him the most, without having to worry about the rigid schedule of a traditional classroom.

Another area where technology has had a significant impact is online jobs. Becoming a YouTuber, for example, has become a popular career path for many young people. With the rise of social media, it has become easier for people to showcase their talents and connect with a global audience. While this can be a lucrative career path, there are also risks involved, such as the constant need to create content and the pressure to maintain a certain image.

In addition to these career paths, technology has also changed the way people shop. With the rise of e-commerce, companies like Amazon have made it easier for people to order goods from the comfort of their own homes. This has made shopping more convenient, but it has also led to concerns about privacy and security.

In conclusion, technology has had a profound impact on people's lives, from education to employment to shopping.

e26e5faa,"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage has become a growing trend in many parts of the world. This concept, referred to as ""smart planning,"" aims to separate suburban life from auto use in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote alternative transportation options. There are several advantages of limiting car usage that are evident in the passage set.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. According to the New York Times, passenger cars account for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some areas in the United States. By decreasing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly reduce these emissions and mitigate the harmful effects of climate change. In Vauban, Germany, a car-free community, 70 percent of families do not own cars, resulting in cleaner air and a more sustainable environment.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is improved public health. The use of cars is associated with sedentary behaviors, such as sitting for prolonged periods of time, which can lead to various health problems, including obesity and heart disease. By encouraging alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, cycling, or public transit, we can promote physical activity and improve overall health and well-being. In Bogota, Colombia, the implementation of a car-free day has led millions of people to hike, bike, skate, or use buses, resulting in empty streets and reduced traffic congestion.

Additionally, limiting car usage can lead to more compact and accessible communities. In the traditional suburban model, cars are necessary for everyday activities, such as grocery shopping or commuting to work. However, by adopting a new approach that places stores within walking distance and emphasizes public transportation, we can create more vibrant and livable communities. Vauban, Germany, serves as an excellent example of this concept, with its walkable streets, bicycle-friendly infrastructure, and easy access to public transit.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. The dependence on cars comes with significant costs, including fuel expenses, maintenance fees, and parking fees. By reducing car usage, individuals can save money and allocate those resources to other aspects of their lives. In Paris, France, a partial driving ban was enforced to combat smog and reduce pollution. While the ban resulted in some loss of revenue for delivery companies, it also highlighted the importance of sustainable transportation alternatives, such as plug-in cars and public transit.

In conclusion, there are numerous advantages to limiting car usage. This includes the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, improved public health, the creation of more compact communities, and economic benefits. The passage set provides examples from different countries, such as Germany, France, and Colombia, where limiting car usage has led to positive outcomes. As we continue to prioritize sustainability and the well-being of our communities, limiting car usage should be considered as a viable solution. By implementing smart planning strategies and promoting alternative transportation options, we can create a more sustainable and livable future.",1,0.9933696,1,True

Working in a group and working alone are two different ways of getting things done, and both have their own benefits. When you work in a group, you can bounce ideas off each other and come up with something way better than you could have on your own. Plus, it's easier to divide up tasks and work on them separately. For example, if you're doing a project for school, you can have one person do the research, one person do the presentation, and one person do the visual aids. That way, you can all work together to make it perfect.

But, working alone can also be good because you can focus on one thing at a time without anyone distracting you. When you're working alone, you can take your time and make sure everything is just right. Plus, you don't have to worry about anyone else's opinions or ideas, so you can do things your own way. For example, if you're writing a story, you can make sure the characters are just how you want them without anyone else changing them.

I think both working in a group and working alone have their own benefits, but I think I prefer working alone. That way, I can focus on my own work and make sure it's perfect.

As the 3rd President of the United States, Thomas Jefferson once said, ""I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."" This quote highlights the importance of setting goals and striving towards them. While some people argue against setting goals, there are many examples of individuals who have achieved great success by setting specific targets for themselves.

One of the main arguments against setting goals is that it can be limiting. People who set goals may become so focused on achieving them that they neglect other aspects of their life. Additionally, setting goals can be stressful and may lead to disappointment if they are not met. However, these potential drawbacks do not outweigh the benefits of setting goals.

Setting goals can provide direction and purpose in life. It can help individuals identify what they want to achieve and give them a clear roadmap to reach their goals. Furthermore, setting goals can be motivating and provide a sense of accomplishment when they are met.

There are many anecdotes of individuals who have achieved great success by setting specific targets for themselves. For example, Oprah Winfrey set a goal to become a talk show host and eventually achieved her goal by launching her own show. Similarly, Michael Jordan set a goal to become the best basketball player in the world and achieved his goal by winning six NBA championships.

It is interesting to note that some people set easier goals and others set more difficult goals. This can be attributed to a variety of factors such as personal beliefs, past experiences, and available resources. However, it is important to remember that setting difficult goals can lead to greater satisfaction and accomplishment when they are met.

Those who have achieved great success by trying hard have used a variety of strategies to reach their goals.

llama_70b_v1456,"Dear State Senator,

I am writing to express my opinion on the matter of the Electoral College system in the United States. As a high school student, I have been learning about the pros and cons of this system, and I believe that it is important to consider the benefits of both the Electoral College and popular vote systems.

Firstly, the Electoral College system was established to ensure that smaller states have a voice in the election process. Without it, presidential candidates would only need to focus on the larger states with more electoral votes, leaving smaller states ignored. This would lead to a disproportionate amount of power being held by a select few states, which goes against the principle of equal representation. Additionally, the Electoral College system encourages coalition-building and compromise between different regions, which can lead to more diverse and well-rounded leadership.

On the other hand, some argue that the Electoral College system is outdated and can lead to a situation where the winner of the popular vote does not win the presidency. This has happened five times in U.S. history, including in the 2000 and 2016 presidential elections. This can lead to questions about the legitimacy of the election and the representation of the people's voices.

However, I believe that changing to a popular vote system would not necessarily solve these issues. A popular vote system would give more power to heavily populated urban areas, which could lead to a disproportionate amount of power being held by a select few regions. This could result in a lack of representation for rural areas and a lack of diversity in leadership. Additionally, a popular vote system could lead to a greater emphasis on campaigning and advertising, which could increase the influence of special interest groups and money in politics.

In conclusion, I believe that the Electoral College system has its benefits and drawbacks, but ultimately, it serves an important purpose in ensuring equal representation for all states. Instead of changing to a popular vote system, I suggest considering reforms to the Electoral College system that address the concerns of fairness and representation. For example, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, which has been adopted by 16 states, ensures that the president is elected by the candidate who receives the most popular votes across the country, while still maintaining the Electoral College system.

Thank you for considering my opinion on this matter. I hope that you will take the time to carefully weigh the pros and cons of both systems and make a decision that benefits the people of our state and the country as a whole.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]",1,0.9942054,1,True

I think that there should be stronger privacy protections on social media so that we can control who sees our information.

One reason why we need stronger privacy protections is that social media companies are making money off of our personal information. They collect our data and sell it to advertisers without our knowledge or consent. This is not right, our personal information is ours and we should have the right to control who sees it.

Another reason is that sharing personal information online can be dangerous. There are a lot of creeps and scammers out there who can use our information to steal our identity or harm us in other ways. We should have the right to protect ourselves and our families from these threats.

Also, social media companies are not doing enough to protect our privacy. They often have weak security measures in place, which makes it easy for hackers to gain access to our information. We need stronger privacy protections to ensure that our information is safe.

On the other hand, some people argue that we should be able to share whatever we want on social media and that privacy protections will limit our ability to connect with others. But I think that this is a false choice. We can still connect with others and share our thoughts and experiences without having to sacrifice our privacy.

Firstly, small acts of kindness can improve someone's attitude. When we show kindness to others, we are acknowledging their worth and value. This can help them feel appreciated and loved, which can improve their mood and outlook on life. For example, if someone is feeling down, a small act of kindness such as a compliment or a smile can brighten their day.

Secondly, small acts of kindness can make someone's day better. Even the smallest gesture of kindness can make a big difference in someone's life. For example, if someone is having a bad day at work, a small act of kindness such as bringing them coffee or offering to help them with a task can make their day better.

Thirdly, small acts of kindness can help someone become a better person. When we show kindness to others, we are setting an example for them to follow. This can help them develop a more compassionate and empathetic attitude. For example, if someone witnesses someone being kind to someone else, they may be more likely to show kindness themselves in the future.

Finally, small acts of kindness can help someone going through hard times. When we show kindness to others, we are providing them with a sense of support and comfort. This can be especially helpful for someone going through a difficult time. For example, if someone is grieving the loss of a loved one, a small act of kindness such as a sympathetic ear or a hug can provide them with the emotional support they need.

In conclusion, small acts of kindness can benefit both the person being shown kindness and the person showing kindness. When we show kindness to others, we are acknowledging their worth and value, making their day better, helping them become a better person, and providing them with emotional support. It is important to remember that even the smallest gesture of kindness can make a big difference in someone's life.",1,0.9944635,1,True

Hey there, I know you're really into the idea that aliens created the Face on Mars, but let me tell you, I'm here to convince you that it's actually just a natural landform. I know, I know, it looks kinda spooky, but hear me out.

Body:
First of all, let's talk about the size of the Face. The article mentions that it's about a mile and a half wide, which is huge! But, it's actually not that big compared to other landforms on Mars. In fact, the article says that there are other features on the planet that are way bigger and more complex. So, if aliens were gonna create a face, wouldn't they make it a bit bigger and more impressive?

Next up, let's look at the shape of the Face. It's definitely not a perfect rectangle or anything, but it's also not a very realistic face. I mean, have you seen it? It's got these weird, curvy lines and there's no nose or mouth. If aliens were gonna make a face, wouldn't they at least give it some actual features?

Now, let's talk about the materials that make up the Face. The article says that it's just a bunch of rocks and sand, which is pretty normal for Mars. There's nothing special or unusual about it. If aliens were gonna build a face, wouldn't they use some kind of advanced technology or materials that we've never seen before?

Finally, let's think about the location of the Face. It's in a pretty weird spot, right in the middle of a bunch of other landforms. If aliens were gonna create a face, wouldn't they put it in a more prominent location, like a hill or a mountain?

Conclusion:
So, there you have it. I hope I've convinced you that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform and not some alien creation. It's definitely an interesting feature, but it's not as exciting as an actual alien face would be. I know it's a bit disappointing, but hey, at least we can still dream about the possibility of alien life out there, right?",1,0.9927804,1,True

Subject: The Importance of Retaining the Electoral College

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my support for retaining the Electoral College in the election of the President of the United States. The Electoral College, as established by our founding fathers, is a compromise between direct election by popular vote and election by Congress. Although many argue for changing to a popular vote system, I believe that keeping the Electoral College is essential for several reasons.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures the certainty of outcome. In an election where disputes can arise, the winner of the Electoral College vote consistently achieves a greater share of electoral votes than their share of popular votes. This reduces the likelihood of a disputed outcome, as demonstrated by the 2012 election where President Obama received a higher proportion of electoral votes compared to his popular vote share.

Secondly, the Electoral College promotes the concept of ""everyone's president."" As no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, candidates are pushed to cultivate trans-regional appeal. This prevents candidates from solely focusing on winning states that they are confident of winning, which would leave residents of other regions feeling disenfranchised.

Additionally, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign in swing states. By using a winner-take-all system, candidates are motivated to concentrate their efforts on toss-up states, where voters pay close attention to the campaign and are more likely to make thoughtful decisions. This ensures that the most informed voters, who have received substantial attention and information from the candidates, have a significant influence in deciding the election's outcome.

Furthermore, the Electoral College provides balance between large and small states. While the Senate's mal-apportionment can lead to an imbalance in political weight, the Electoral College restores some of this balance. For instance, Florida, a large state, received more attention from presidential candidates in the 2012 elections compared to Wyoming, a small state, despite the popular vote being close in both states. This encourages candidates to address the concerns of citizens in both populous and less populated areas.

Lastly, the Electoral College prevents the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate wins a majority of popular votes, the Electoral College consistently produces a clear winner. This eliminates the necessity and complications of run-off elections, ensuring a smooth and decisive determination of the president.

While critics argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters by making their vote seemingly irrelevant, studies show that voter turnout in presidential elections remains high. Voters participate in the elections to express their political preferences, rather than with the expectation that their individual vote will sway the national outcome.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a critical institution that preserves the integrity and balance of our democratic process. It guarantees a certain outcome, encourages candidates to appeal to a broader audience, ensures thoughtful voting in swing states, balances the interests of large and small states, and eliminates the need for run-off elections. Therefore, I urge you to support keeping the Electoral College to maintain the stability and fairness of our presidential elections.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will consider the significance of the Electoral College in shaping a successful and representative democracy.

Sincerely,

So, you know how people always say ""actions speak louder than words""? Yeah, I totally agree. Like, when you show people that you're kind, patient, and respectful, it really makes a difference. I mean, think about it, when you're nice to someone, they're more likely to be nice to you back. And when you're mean to someone, well, let's just say it's not a good look for you. 🙄

I mean, think about it, when you're in a group of friends and one of them is being really mean to someone else, you're more likely to speak up and tell them to stop, right? That's because you know that being mean is not cool, and you want to be part of a group that's supportive and respectful. And when you show others that you're a kind and compassionate person, they're more likely to be the same way around you. It's like, this big ol' cycle of positivity! 🌈

But it's not just about being kind to your friends, it's about being kind to everyone. Like, your teachers, your family, even strangers on the street.

ADC42265FD32,"Title: The Double-Edged Sword of Technology

As an 8th grader, I have grown up surrounded by technology. From smartphones to laptops, tablets to smart TVs, technology has become an integral part of our daily lives. While technology has made many tasks easier and more convenient, it also has its downsides. In this essay, I will explore the positive and negative effects of technology and its impact on various aspects of our lives.

On the positive side, technology has made it easier for people to access information and learn new things. With the internet at our fingertips, we can quickly look up information on any topic, watch educational videos, or take online courses. Technology has also revolutionized the way we consume entertainment, allowing us to watch TV shows and videos on demand, anytime and anywhere.

However, technology also has its negative effects. For example, excessive screen time can lead to eye strain, headaches, and poor sleep quality. Moreover, technology can be a distraction, making it difficult for students to focus in class and affecting their learning. Additionally, technology can be used for nefarious purposes, such as cyberbullying, identity theft, and scams targeting the elderly.

In the classroom, technology has both helped and hindered student learning. On the one hand, it allows students to access a wealth of educational resources, collaborate with peers, and complete assignments more efficiently. On the other hand, it can be a distraction, leading to decreased attention span and decreased productivity.

Another area where technology has had a significant impact is in the way scammers target the elderly. Scammers use technology to steal personal information, such as credit card numbers and social security numbers, through phishing emails, fake websites, and other means. This can lead to financial loss and identity theft, which can have serious consequences for the elderly.

In conclusion, technology can be used for both positive and negative purposes. While it has made many tasks easier and more convenient, it also has its downsides. To ensure that technology is used responsibly, it is important to be aware of its potential negative effects and take steps to mitigate them.

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my opinion regarding the Electoral College and its role in the election of the President of the United States. As a concerned citizen and voter, I believe that the Electoral College should be retained rather than changing to a system of election by popular vote. While there are valid arguments on both sides of this issue, I will outline several reasons why the Electoral College has merit and should be preserved.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures the certainty of outcome in presidential elections. It is highly unlikely for a dispute to occur over the electoral vote, as the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College consistently exceeds their share of the popular vote. This is due to the winner-take-all system in most states, where even a small plurality in a state results in a landslide electoral-vote victory. This system reduces the likelihood of contentious disagreements over the outcome of the election.

Secondly, the Electoral College promotes the idea of ""everyone's president"" by requiring presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, which discourages candidates from focusing solely on specific regions. This ensures that the elected president will have a broader support base and is more likely to govern with consideration for the interests of all regions in the country.

Additionally, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign in swing states where the outcome of the election is uncertain. This system compels politicians to pay attention to a diverse range of states and their issues instead of solely focusing on large population centers. Swing states receive increased campaign efforts and attention, allowing voters in those states to make informed decisions and have a significant impact on the outcome of the election. This focus on swing states also incentivizes thoughtful voting and engagement with the campaign by the electorate.

Furthermore, the Electoral College restores a sense of balance for large states by providing them with more weight in the political process. While the Senate provides malapportionment of large states by population, the Electoral College allows presidential candidates to allocate resources and focus attention on densely populated states. This ensures that large states receive necessary attention from candidates during campaigns, regardless of the overall population disparities.

Lastly, the Electoral College effectively avoids the need for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the popular vote. Instead, this system produces a clear winner by requiring the majority of electoral votes, reducing the complications and expenses associated with conducting additional voting rounds for a clear winner to emerge.

While there are valid concerns about the Electoral College, it is worth noting that the system has worked for over two centuries and safeguarded against potential election crises. The inefficiencies experienced in several instances are outweighed by the strength and stability the Electoral College provides to the democratic process.

In conclusion, I believe that the Electoral College should be retained as the method for electing the President of the United States. Its ability to ensure a certain outcome, promote trans-regional appeal, focus on swing states, provide weight to large states, and avoid run-off elections are all compelling reasons to preserve this system. I respectfully urge you to take these factors into consideration when discussing any potential changes to our election process.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I trust you will carefully weigh the arguments both for and against the Electoral College in your decision-making process. If you require any further information or would like to discuss this matter further, please do not hesitate to contact me.

llama_70b_v1183,"Yea, I definetly think that distance lerning is a good idear. First of all, it would be way more convinient for kids who live far away from skool. They wouldent have to wake up so early and spend so long on the bus. They could just wake up and get online. My friend's cousin does distance lerning and he says it's way easier.

Another thing is that kids who are sick or have anxiety can still go to skool without having to worry about being in a room full of other kids. That's why I think it would be good for kids who have trouble with social anxiety. They could still lern and participate without feeling nervous. My friend's sister does distance lerning and she says she feels way more comfortable.

It would also be good for kids who have to miss skool for some reason. Like if they have a doctors apt or something. They could still go to skool and not fall behind. My cousin had to miss skool for a week because of a family emergency, but he was able to keep up with his work because of distance lerning.

I know some people might say that distance lerning would be bad because kids need to be in a classroom to learn. But, if they have a good internet connection, they can still see and hear everything the teacher is saying. They can even ask questions and participate in discussions. It's like they're in the classroom but they're at home.

I think distance lerning is a great idear and more schools should offer it. It would make things way easier and more convenient for kids who have trouble getting to skool or who need to miss skool for some reason.

falcon_180b_v1_856,"#TheRoleOfLibrariesInTheDigitalAge

In the past, libraries were seen as a hub of knowledge and information. However, with the rise of the digital age, many people have questioned the continued importance of libraries. As a grade 9 student, I believe that libraries remain relevant and essential in today's society. In this essay, I will argue in favor of libraries by providing reasons and examples.

##TheImportanceOfLibraries

Libraries play a crucial role in our lives by providing access to a vast collection of books, magazines, newspapers, and other resources that we may not have at home. They offer a quiet space for students to study and conduct research, which is essential for academic success. Libraries also offer free access to computers and the internet, allowing people who cannot afford these resources to access them.

###AccessToBooks

One of the primary reasons why libraries are still important is because they provide access to books. Despite the rise of e-books and online reading platforms, many people still prefer physical books. Libraries offer an extensive collection of books on various topics, from fiction to non-fiction, catering to different interests and reading levels.

###QuietStudySpaces

Another critical function of libraries is providing a quiet study space. Many students do not have a suitable environment at home to concentrate on their studies, making it challenging to complete assignments and prepare for exams. Libraries offer a distraction-free environment, allowing students to focus on their work and achieve better academic results.

###FreeAccessToTechnology

Libraries also play a vital role in bridging the digital divide by offering free access to computers and the internet. Not everyone can afford to buy a computer or pay for internet services, which can limit their opportunities for learning, job hunting, and staying connected with others. By providing these resources, libraries ensure that everyone, regardless of their financial situation, has equal access to information and opportunities.

##Conclusion

In conclusion, libraries remain relevant and essential in today's society, despite the rise of the digital age. They provide access to books, quiet study spaces, and free access to technology, among other resources. Therefore, we should continue supporting our local libraries and recognize their valuable contributions to our communities.",1,0.9943463,1,True

By actively engaging in the learning process, students can improve their future prospects in various ways. In this essay, I will discuss the benefits of being an actively engaged student and how it can positively impact a person's future.

Firstly, being an actively engaged student can lead to better academic performance. When students actively engage in the learning process, they are more likely to understand the material, retain information, and apply it in their studies. This can result in higher grades, test scores, and overall academic success. In turn, this success can lead to better college admission opportunities, scholarships, and financial aid.

Secondly, actively engaged students are more likely to develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills. By actively engaging in the learning process, students are exposed to different perspectives and ideas, which can help them develop their own opinions and ideas. This exposure to diverse viewpoints can also help students identify and analyze problems, leading to better decision-making and problem-solving skills. These skills are highly valued by employers and can lead to better job opportunities and career advancement.

Thirdly, being an actively engaged student can lead to improved social and emotional development. When students actively engage in the learning process, they are more likely to develop strong relationships with their peers and teachers. These relationships can help students build self-confidence, develop communication skills, and improve their overall emotional well-being. These skills are essential for personal and professional success and can help students navigate social situations and relationships more effectively.

In conclusion, being an actively engaged student has numerous benefits that can positively impact a person's future prospects. By actively engaging in the learning process, students can improve their academic performance, develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills, and improve their social and emotional development.

llama_70b_v1363,"I'm glad you asked! The transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy is a topic that's really important to me, and I think it's essential that we consider the pros and cons before making a decision.

Firstly, let's talk about the reasons why we should transition to renewable energy. One of the most significant advantages is that renewable energy is sustainable and doesn't harm the environment. Unlike fossil fuels, which release harmful greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change, renewable energy sources like solar and wind power are clean and don't produce any emissions. This means that switching to renewable energy can help reduce our carbon footprint and slow down global warming.

Another benefit of renewable energy is that it's becoming increasingly cost-effective. While the initial investment in renewable energy infrastructure can be expensive, the long-term savings are significant. In fact, according to a report by the Solar Energy Industries Association, the cost of solar energy has dropped by 69% over the past decade, making it more affordable for businesses and households.

Furthermore, renewable energy can create jobs and stimulate local economies. For example, the wind industry already supports over 100,000 jobs in the United States, and solar energy employment has grown by 175% over the past five years.

Now, let's look at some reasons why we might not want to transition to renewable energy. One of the main concerns is that renewable energy isn't always reliable. Solar and wind power are intermittent sources of energy, which means that they're not always available when we need them. This can make it challenging to rely solely on renewable energy, especially when the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing.

Another disadvantage is that the infrastructure for renewable energy can be expensive to install and maintain. While the cost of renewable energy is decreasing, it can still be cost-prohibitive for some individuals and businesses, especially in rural areas where access to renewable energy sources may be limited.

Finally, some people argue that transitioning to renewable energy will hurt the economy, particularly industries that rely on fossil fuels. For example, coal mining communities may be impacted by the shift towards renewable energy.

In conclusion, while there are valid reasons both for and against transitioning to renewable energy, I believe that the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. Not only is renewable energy better for the environment, but it's also becoming more cost-effective and can create jobs. Sure, there are some challenges to overcome, but with the right investments and policies in place, we can make the transition to renewable energy a successful one.

61C4FCA012D7,"When discussing the pros and cons of changing the school menu for the benefit of student health and academic performance, it is important to consider both sides. On one hand, providing students with healthy meals provides the essential nutrients and energy needed to focus in class and refrain from getting sick. Studies have shown that students who regularly eat healthful school lunches tend to have higher grade point averages and miss fewer days of school. For example, a study conducted at a high school in California found that students who ate school lunches had higher grades than those who brought their own.

On the other hand, changing the school menu may present more challenges than benefits. As schools transition to healthier options, students may not take the change positively, leading to lack of interest in the meals and potential food waste. Additionally, some students may require additional dietary accommodations that may not be available in the new menu. Furthermore, although healthier options can be more expensive, school budgets are limited. Having to pay for these meals could place an additional burden on students and families.

llama_70b_v1500,"I think it's important to talk about the use of animals in scientific research because it's a big issue that affects a lot of living beings. I understand that scientists want to help people and make new discoveries, but I don't think it's right to use animals to do that.

First of all, animals are living beings too, and they have feelings and rights just like we do. It's not fair to use them for our own benefit, especially when they can't even say no or give their permission. Imagine if we were the ones being used in experiments and we couldn't do anything about it! It would be really scary and unfair.

Secondly, animals are not always necessary for scientific research. There are lots of other ways to test things out, like using cells or computer models. These methods are not only more humane, but they can also be more accurate and cost-effective in the long run.

Furthermore, some scientists have been using animals in ways that are not ethical. For example, they might use animals that are endangered or they might hurt the animals more than they need to. This is not only bad for the animals, but it's also against the law in some cases.

On the other hand, some people might argue that animals are necessary for scientific research because they help us find new treatments and medicines. While it's true that animals have been used in some important discoveries, I think we can find other ways to do it that don't involve hurting animals.

In conclusion, I think we should try to use fewer animals in scientific research and look for other ways to test things out.

EBD586EB3AA8,"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that having a four-day school week has its advantages and disadvantages. While it can help conserve energy and resources, it can also limit the time students have to participate in extracurricular activities, work, and help with younger siblings. In this essay, I will discuss the disadvantages of having a four-day school week and compare them to the benefits.

One of the main disadvantages of having a four-day school week is that students may not have enough time to participate in extracurricular activities. Many students participate in sports, clubs, and other activities outside of school, and having an extra day off can make it difficult to balance these activities with their academic responsibilities. For example, if a student is on a sports team that practices three days a week, having an extra day off can make it challenging for them to keep up with their practice schedule and maintain their performance level. This can lead to missed opportunities to develop new skills and build relationships with their teammates.

Another disadvantage of having a four-day school week is that students may not have enough time to work. Many students have part-time jobs or internships, and having an extra day off can make it difficult for them to balance their work responsibilities with their academic ones. For example, if a student works 20 hours per week and has a four-day school week, they may struggle to complete their workload in time for their shift. This can lead to missed opportunities to gain valuable work experience and build their resume.

Finally, having a four-day school week can also limit the time students have to help with younger siblings. Many students have younger siblings who rely on them for care and support, and having an extra day off can make it difficult for them to balance their responsibilities at home with their academic ones. For example, if a student has a younger sibling who needs help with homework or other tasks, having an extra day off can make it difficult for them to provide the necessary support. This can lead to missed opportunities to develop important family relationships and responsibilities.

While having a four-day school week has its advantages, such as energy conservation and reduced resources used, it also has its disadvantages. Students may not have enough time to participate in extracurricular activities, work, or help with younger siblings. It",1,0.99438596,1,True

653620381DB3,"The idea of changing the duration of public high school from four years to three years has been a topic of debate for a long time. While some people believe that this change would have a positive impact on students, others argue that it would have negative consequences. In this essay, I will analyze the advantages and disadvantages of this change for students and identify other factors that could have a significant role in the decision to pursue three years of high school.

One of the main advantages of a three-year high school is that it would allow students to enter the workforce earlier. This would give them the opportunity to start earning money and gaining work experience at a younger age. This could be particularly beneficial for students who come from low-income families or who need to support themselves while in school. Additionally, a shorter high school duration could also reduce the cost of education, as students would be able to graduate and enter the workforce sooner.

However, there are also several disadvantages to a three-year high school. One of the main concerns is that students may not be fully prepared for the workforce. High school is meant to provide students with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in the workforce, and a shorter high school duration could limit the amount of time students have to develop these skills. Additionally, a shorter high school duration could also limit the amount of time students have to pursue extracurricular activities or to explore their interests.

Another factor that could have a significant role in the decision to pursue three years of high school is the availability of job opportunities. If there are a large number of job opportunities available for students who have only completed three years of high school, it may be more attractive for students to pursue this option. However, if there are few job opportunities available for students who have only completed three years of high school, it may not be as attractive.

In conclusion, the idea of changing the duration of public high school from four years to three years is a complex one. While there are several advantages to a shorter high school duration, there are also several disadvantages. Ultimately, the decision to pursue three years of high school should be based on a careful analysis of the advantages and disadvantages, as well as other factors such as the availability of job opportunities.",1,0.99444973,1,True
93552F3ACA5D,"Technology has revolutionized the way we communicate and interact with each other. From social media to instant messaging, we have countless ways to connect with people from all over the world. While technology has brought many benefits, it has also had a significant impact on interpersonal relationships. In this essay, I will discuss the negative effects of technology on interpersonal relationships.

One of the most significant negative effects of technology on interpersonal relationships is the loss of face-to-face communication. With the rise of social media and instant messaging, people are increasingly relying on digital communication to connect with others. While this can be convenient, it can also lead to a lack of personal interaction. When we communicate through screens, we miss out on the non-verbal cues that are so important in building and maintaining relationships. This can lead to misunderstandings, misinterpretations, and a lack of emotional connection.

Another negative effect of technology on interpersonal relationships is the loss of privacy. With the rise of social media, our personal lives are more accessible than ever before. Our friends, family, and even strangers can see our posts, photos, and updates. This can be uncomfortable and lead to a loss of privacy. It can also lead to cyberbullying, online harassment, and other negative online behaviors.

Finally, technology can also lead to a lack of empathy and understanding in interpersonal relationships. When we communicate through screens, we can become disconnected from the emotions and experiences of others. This can lead to a lack of empathy and understanding, which is essential for building and maintaining healthy relationships. It can also lead to a lack of emotional intelligence, which is important for effective communication and relationship building.

In conclusion, while technology has brought many benefits, it has also had a significant impact on interpersonal relationships. The loss of face-to-face communication, the loss of privacy, and the lack of empathy and understanding are just a few of the negative effects of technology on relationships. It is important for us to be aware of these effects and take steps to mitigate them. This can include limiting our screen time, being mindful of our online behavior, and prioritizing face-to-face communication in our relationships. By doing so, we can build and maintain healthy, meaningful relationships in the digital age.",1,0.99455005,1,True

falcon_180b_v1_494,"Single-use plastic products have become a hot topic in recent years due to their negative impact on the environment. There are arguments both for and against the ban of these products, and I believe that we should ban single-use plastics to help protect our planet.

Firstly, single-use plastics are a major contributor to pollution. They often end up in our oceans and harm marine life. For example, plastic bags can be mistaken for jellyfish by sea turtles, and they can end up eating them, which can lead to serious health problems or even death. Additionally, plastic straws can get stuck in the noses of sea turtles, causing them pain and suffering. By banning single-use plastics, we can reduce the amount of plastic waste that ends up in our oceans and protect marine life.

Secondly, single-use plastics are not biodegradable, which means that they will stay in the environment for hundreds of years. This can lead to a buildup of plastic waste in landfills and other areas. Furthermore, plastic waste can release harmful chemicals into the soil and water, which can be harmful to both humans and animals. By banning single-use plastics, we can reduce the amount of plastic waste that ends up in landfills and prevent harmful chemicals from being released into the environment.

Finally, there are many alternatives to single-use plastics that are more environmentally friendly. For example, reusable bags, water bottles, and straws can be used multiple times, reducing the amount of waste that is produced. Additionally, biodegradable plastics are becoming more widely available, which can help reduce the amount of plastic waste that ends up in the environment. By promoting the use of these alternatives, we can reduce our reliance on single-use plastics and protect the environment.

In conclusion, the ban of single-use plastics is necessary to protect our planet. These products are a major contributor to pollution, they are not biodegradable, and there are many alternatives available that are more environmentally friendly. By taking action to ban single-use plastics, we can help protect marine life, reduce the amount of plastic waste in landfills, and promote more sustainable alternatives.

607A39D981DE,"As an 8th-grade student, it is important to make informed decisions about getting involved in school activities. Before making any decisions, it is crucial to talk to your parents about the potential impact of taking on too many activities.

One of the most important factors to consider is the amount of time you will have to spend on activities and other responsibilities. If you take on too many activities, you may not have enough time to focus on your school work, which could result in poor grades. It is important to balance your extracurricular activities with your academic responsibilities to ensure that you are able to maintain a healthy work-life balance.

In addition to considering the time commitment, it is also important to consider the impact that activities may have on your mental and physical health. It is important to make sure that you are able to manage your time effectively and that you are able to take breaks and prioritize self-care when needed.

It is also a good idea to have a meeting with the school to discuss the extracurricular activities and get your parents' opinions. This will allow you to gain a better understanding of the available activities and their potential impact on your schedule. It will also give you the opportunity to discuss any concerns or questions you may have with the school administration.

Ultimately, it is important to make informed decisions about getting involved in school activities. By considering the time commitment, the impact on your mental and physical health, and getting input from your parents and the school, you can make a decision that is best for you and your academic success.",1,0.9943826,1,True
llama_70b_v11099,"Marijuana, also known as cannabis, has been a topic of debate for a long time. Some people think it's a harmful drug that should be illegal, while others believe it's a harmless plant that should be legalized. In my opinion, marijuana should be legalized.

First of all, it's important to acknowledge that marijuana has some medical benefits. It can be used to treat chronic pain, anxiety, and even cancer. Patients who suffer from these conditions should have the right to use marijuana as a form of medicine. Making it legal would make it easier for them to access it.

Secondly, criminalizing marijuana has led to a lot of problems. Many people are arrested and jailed for possessing small amounts of marijuana, which can have a negative impact on their lives. They may lose their jobs, homes, and even custody of their children. This is unfair and unjust. Legalizing marijuana would help to reduce the number of people in jail for non-violent drug offenses.

Thirdly, legalizing marijuana would help to reduce drug-related violence. Now, drug dealers and cartels make a lot of money from selling marijuana illegally. If it were legal, the government could regulate and tax it, taking away the profit from these criminal organizations. This would reduce the incentive for them to engage in illegal activities.

Furthermore, legalizing marijuana would allow for more research to be done on its effects. Scientists could study the plant and its effects on the human body, which would help us to understand it better. This could lead to new medicines and treatments.

However, some people argue that marijuana is a harmful drug that can damage the brain and lead to addiction. While it's true that marijuana can have negative effects, so can many other substances that are legal, such as alcohol and tobacco. It's important to remember that marijuana is not as harmful as other drugs, such as heroin or cocaine.

In conclusion, legalizing marijuana would have many benefits. It would help patients who need it for medical reasons, reduce drug-related violence, and allow for more research to be done. It's important to remember that marijuana is not a dangerous drug, and legalizing it would not lead to an increase in drug use or abuse. I believe that marijuana should be legalized, and I hope that in the future, more people will see the benefits of doing so.",1,0.9944318,1,True
llama_70b_v1928,"As a grade 12 student, I strongly believe that the use of single-use plastic products has become a significant concern for our environment. The disposable nature of these products has led to a massive accumulation of plastic waste, which has severe consequences on our planet. In my opinion, banning single-use plastics is the most effective way to mitigate this issue.

One of the primary reasons for banning single-use plastics is the devastating impact they have on marine life. Plastic waste often ends up in oceans, where animals mistake it for food, leading to choking, suffocation, or even death. For instance, plastic bags are often mistaken for jellyfish by sea turtles, which can cause fatalities. Moreover, plastic microbeads, which are commonly found in face wash and toothpaste, are ingested by fish and can enter the food chain, harming humans who consume them. By banning single-use plastics, we can significantly reduce the amount of plastic waste that ends up in our oceans and protect marine life.

Another significant reason for banning single-use plastics is the contribution they make to climate change. The production of plastic requires the extraction and use of fossil fuels, which releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, contributing to global warming. Additionally, the transportation of plastic products and waste also leads to increased carbon emissions. By reducing our reliance on single-use plastics, we can decrease our carbon footprint and help combat climate change.

Furthermore, single-use plastics also have adverse effects on human health. BPA, a chemical commonly found in plastic products, has been linked to various health problems, including cancer, obesity, and reproductive issues. By avoiding single-use plastics, we can minimize our exposure to harmful chemicals and promote better health.

Some argue that banning single-use plastics would be too costly and inconvenient. However, there are many alternatives available that are both affordable and convenient. For instance, reusable bags, water bottles, and coffee cups can be purchased at a low cost and used multiple times. Additionally, many businesses are now offering discounts for customers who bring their reusable products, incentivizing people to make sustainable choices.

In conclusion, banning single-use plastics is a necessary step towards protecting our environment, marine life, and human health. While some may argue that it would be too costly or inconvenient, there are many affordable and convenient alternatives available. It is our responsibility as a society to make sustainable choices and ensure a healthier future for generations to come.",1,0.9939319,1,True
falcon_180b_v1_1021,"""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" is the name of the article that talks about a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System. This system is capable of identifying human emotions through facial expressions. The author describes how this technology can be used to understand the feelings and emotions of people accurately. While the technology has its benefits, the real question is whether it is useful to use it in the classroom. 

In my opinion, it would be valuable to use this technology in the classroom. Teachers could use this technology to identify the emotions of their students. This would help the teachers to better understand their students and their needs. For example, if a student is feeling sad or anxious, the teacher could identify this through their facial expressions and offer support accordingly. 

Moreover, the technology would enable teachers to create a better learning environment in the classroom. If a teacher is aware of the emotional state of their students, they can adjust their teaching style and methods to ensure that their students are engaged and interested in learning. This would lead to better academic outcomes for students.

Furthermore, the technology could be used to identify and address bullying in the classroom. Teachers could use the Facial Action Coding System to identify when a student is feeling angry or upset, and investigate further to find out the reason. This would help in creating a safe and inclusive classroom environment.

In conclusion, the use of Facial Action Coding System in the classroom would be valuable. It would help teachers to better understand their students and their emotions, leading to a better learning environment and improved academic outcomes.

While some may argue that it will provide more time for learning and studying, others may argue that it will cause unnecessary stress and disrupt the student's schedule. In this essay, I will discuss the pros and cons of adding an extra hour or a half hour to the school day and suggest ways to ensure that everyone has a voice in this decision.

On the positive side, an extra hour or a half hour can provide students with more time to learn and study. With more time, students can complete more assignments, review more material, and prepare for exams. This can lead to better academic performance and a better understanding of the subject matter. Additionally, an extra hour or a half hour can provide students with more time to socialize and interact with their peers. This can improve their social skills and overall well-being.

On the negative side, an extra hour or a half hour can cause unnecessary stress and disrupt the student's schedule. With more time, students may feel overwhelmed and struggle to manage their time effectively. This can lead to poor academic performance and a decrease in overall well-being. Additionally, an extra hour or a half hour can disrupt the student's extracurricular activities and other commitments outside of school. This can lead to a decrease in their involvement in these activities and a decrease in their overall happiness.

Parents may also disagree with the change, as they may feel that their child's schedule is already too busy. With an extra hour or a half hour, parents may feel that their child is not getting enough time to rest and relax. Additionally, parents may worry about the cost of the change, as it may require additional resources and funding.

To ensure that everyone has a voice in this decision, it is important to involve students, parents, and teachers in the conversation. Students can provide insight into how an extra hour or a half hour would affect their academic performance and overall well-being. Parents can provide insight into how the change would affect their child's schedule and overall happiness. Teachers can provide insight into how the change would affect their teaching and the overall classroom environment.

6C449C1EDB2D,"One of the main benefits of having a Positive Mental Attitude (PMA) is that it can help create a feeling of well-being and encourage resilience in difficult situations. PMA allows people to view life's challenges as opportunities rather than obstacles, giving them the confidence to take the initiative and take risks. For example, someone with a PMA might look at a job loss as a chance to find a new job in an even better field. 

On the other hand, a PMA could be detrimental when taken to extremes. If someone takes a PMA too far they can become overly optimistic, leading them to gloss over potential risks and problems. For instance, someone with a PMA might take on a job with an unrealistic deadline, not fully understanding the difficulties associated with it.

It is no surprise that having a positive attitude can help us to tackle many of life’s tricky situations, from job interviews, to managing relationships, to simply navigating through life. It gives us strength and helps us remain focused on the big picture even when faced with adversity and setbacks.

One example of having a positive attitude leading to success is Bill Samuels Jr. After initial failure from whiskey-making, he didn’t give up. He believed in himself and his skills, and was able to persistently work on a new recipe he initially believed had no chance of succeeding.

falcon_180b_v1_1042,"I think that animals should not be used in scientific research at all. It is wrong to use them for our benefit, especially when it harms them physically and mentally. We should respect animals and treat them with kindness.

One of the main reasons why I believe animals should not be used in scientific research is because it is cruel. For instance, animals are often forced to eat or inhale chemicals, which can make them sick or even kill them. Moreover, they are often kept in tiny cages for long periods of time, which can cause them to become depressed or anxious.

Animals also have rights, and we have a moral responsibility to protect them from harm. It is unfair to use them for our benefit without consent. They cannot speak up for themselves, so it is up to us to be their advocates.

Finally, there are alternative methods to animal testing that can be used. For example, computer modeling and in-vitro testing can provide accurate results without the use of animals. These methods are more humane and can also save money.

EAE70CCAFC13,"Failure: The Untapped Resource for Personal Growth

As an 8th grader, I've experienced my fair share of failures. From botched science experiments to poorly written essays, it can be tempting to view failure as a negative aspect of our lives. However, I've come to realize that failure is actually a valuable tool for personal growth and development.

On the one hand, failure can be incredibly discouraging. When we don't meet our own expectations or those of others, it can lead to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem. For example, if I don't get into my dream high school, I might feel like I'm not good enough or smart enough. These negative emotions can linger and affect my motivation and confidence in other areas of my life.

On the other hand, failure can be a powerful teacher. When we fail, we're forced to reflect on what went wrong and how we can improve. For instance, if I bomb a test, I can review the material, ask my teacher for help, or find additional resources to improve my understanding of the subject. By learning from our mistakes, we can become better versions of ourselves.

Moreover, failure can help us develop resilience and perseverance. When we face challenges and overcome them, we build mental toughness and determination. These qualities are essential for achieving our goals and overcoming obstacles in the future. For example, if I don't get the lead role in the school play, I might be disappointed at first, but I can use that disappointment to work harder and improve my acting skills for the next production.

Another important aspect of failure is that it can help us develop empathy and compassion for others. When we fail, we learn to be more understanding and supportive of those who are struggling. By putting ourselves in other people's shoes, we can build stronger relationships and create a more supportive community. For example, if my friend fails a test, I can offer to study with them or help them find additional resources to improve their understanding of the subject.

So, I found out that there are pros and cons to each of these activities.

AC1F60D0F85D,"Self-reliance is an important aspect of life that can help individuals make informed decisions and achieve their goals. However, there are times when seeking guidance from experts can be necessary. In this essay, I will explore the concept of self-reliance in relation to important life decisions and evaluate the pros and cons of making decisions independently versus relying on expert advice.

Self-reliance refers to the ability of an individual to rely on their own skills, knowledge, and resources to achieve their goals. It is a valuable trait that can help individuals make informed decisions and take control of their lives. For example, when making a decision about a career path, self-reliance can help an individual research and evaluate different options, weigh the pros and cons, and ultimately make an informed decision.

However, there are times when seeking guidance from experts can be necessary. For example, when making a major financial decision such as investing in a business or buying a property, seeking advice from a financial expert can be crucial. These experts have specialized knowledge and experience in their field and can provide valuable insights and advice to help individuals make informed decisions.

On the other hand, relying too heavily on expert advice can also have its drawbacks. For example, an individual may become overly dependent on the advice of others and lose their ability to make decisions independently. Additionally, expert advice may not always be accurate or relevant to an individual's specific situation.

Personally, I have experienced the benefits of both self-reliance and seeking expert advice. When making a decision about which college to attend, I relied heavily on my own research and evaluation of different options. However, when making a decision about a major, I sought advice from a career counselor who helped me evaluate my strengths and interests and ultimately choose a major that was a good fit for me.

In conclusion, self-reliance is an important aspect of life that can help individuals make informed decisions and achieve their goals. However, there are times when seeking guidance from experts can be necessary.

8ED2404D111E,"Hey there!  So, for this essay, I had to research the impact of failure on the success of individuals, specifically focusing on ESL (English as a Second Language) students. Like, I know it might seem kinda weird to talk about failure, but trust me, it's actually pretty important.

So, Winston Churchill once said, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts."" And I think that's really deep. Like, failure is totally a part of life, and it can be really tough to deal with. But, it's also super important to learn from our mistakes and keep going.

ESL students, in particular, might face even more challenges when it comes to failure. I mean, they're already learning a new language and culture, which can be really hard. And if they fail, it can be even harder to keep going. But, at the same time, failure can be a great teacher. It can help them learn and grow, and it can make them even more determined to succeed.

One thing I learned from my research is that failure can actually help ESL students develop their language skills. Like, when they make mistakes, they have to figure out why they made them, and how to fix them. And that can help them learn and improve their language skills. Plus, it can help them develop their problem-solving skills, which is super important in any language.

Another thing I found out is that failure can help ESL students build their confidence. Like, when they first start learning a new language, they might make mistakes and feel embarrassed or ashamed. But, if they keep trying and keep failing, they can start to feel more confident in their abilities. And that can help them feel more comfortable speaking and learning in a new language.

So, in conclusion, failure is not the end of the world. In fact, it can be a really important part of the journey to success. ESL students, in particular, can benefit from failure because it can help them learn and grow. So, instead of being afraid of failure, they should embrace it and use it as an opportunity to learn and improve.

C49F716838E7,"Year-round schooling, instead of the more common September-June schedule, is one way school districts are attempting to improve the quality of education. While it offers some potential advantages, there are also potential disadvantages to consider.

Advantages of year-round school include the potential to reduce summer learning loss. Students who attend year-round schools experience shorter breaks throughout the year, which allows them to maintain more of the knowledge they acquire during the school year. Additionally, year-round schools may benefit from increased parental involvement, as parents will be present for more of their child’s education throughout the year.

However, there are also potential disadvantages to consider. Many students and parents may dislike the lack of extended summer vacation often associated with year-round school. Also, such a schedule requires additional resources, such as additional busing and buildings, which may be a burden on school districts with limited budgets. Additionally, such a schedule could make it more difficult for students and their families to schedule or participate in summer activities or travel during long breaks.

CA290993DFBA,"Online classes are not all they're cracked up to be, folks. While they may offer some convenience and flexibility, there are plenty of disadvantages that make them less than ideal for students. One of the biggest drawbacks is the lack of face-to-face interaction with the teacher and other students. This can make it harder to ask questions and get help when you need it. Plus, it's just not the same as being in a real classroom where you can bounce ideas off of each other and learn from each other's perspectives.

Another major downside of online classes is the lack of structure. Without a set schedule and routine, it's easy to fall behind or lose motivation. You don't have to worry about getting to class on time or sitting through a boring lecture, but you do have to be disciplined enough to stay on track and keep up with the coursework. And let's be real, sometimes it's hard to stay focused when you're sitting in your pajamas in your bedroom.

But wait, there's more! Not taking notes in an online class can have serious consequences. Without those notes, you're gonna forget everything the teacher said pretty quickly. And let's be real, who wants to rewatch a whole lecture just to remember what they learned? It's like, hello, brain overload! Plus, without those notes, you're gonna struggle on tests and quizzes. Good luck trying to recall all that information without any reminders.

9E478C982AD0,"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that having a policy where students are allowed to use their cellphones during lunch and free time has both benefits and drawbacks. While it may seem like a simple solution to allow students to use their phones during these times, there are several factors that must be considered before making a decision.

On the one hand, allowing students to use their phones during lunch and free time can have several benefits. For one, it can help students stay connected with their friends and family, especially during times when they may not see each other often. Additionally, it can provide students with a way to pass the time and stay entertained during free periods, which can help to alleviate boredom and improve their overall mood. Furthermore, it can also allow students to access important information and resources, such as study materials or homework assignments, which can help them to stay on top of their work.

On the other hand, there are also several drawbacks to this policy. For one, allowing students to use their phones during lunch and free time can be a major distraction, and can prevent students from focusing on their work or engaging in meaningful conversations with their peers. Additionally, it can also lead to a decrease in social skills and a lack of face-to-face interaction, which can have negative effects on students' overall development. Furthermore, it can also create a safety concern, as students may be more vulnerable to cyberbullying or other forms of online harassment when they are not supervised.

In conclusion, while there are certainly benefits to allowing students to use their cellphones during lunch and free time, there are also several drawbacks that must be considered before making a decision. Ultimately, it is up to the school administration to weigh the pros and cons and make a decision that is in the best interest of the students. However, it is important to remember that students' well-being should always be the top priority, and any policy that may negatively impact their social skills or safety should be carefully considered before being implemented.",1,0.99445987,1,True

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the topic of the Electoral College and the method of selecting the President of the United States. After carefully considering the information from various sources, I believe that the Electoral College should be retained for the following reasons:

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures a certainty of outcome. As stated by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College tends to exceed their share of the popular vote. This provides a clear and definitive outcome, reducing the likelihood of disputes over the election results. In contrast, a popular vote system could result in numerous recounts and potential challenges, as seen in the 2000 election. The Electoral College provides a more stable and less contentious process for determining the president.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it promotes the idea of ""everyone's president."" In a country as diverse as ours, it is essential for a president to have trans-regional appeal and support. The Electoral College ensures that candidates must campaign and gain support across different regions of the country, rather than solely focusing on areas where they have the greatest popularity. This leads to a broader representation of the nation's interests and a president who can work effectively for the entire country.

The use of swing states is another valuable aspect of the Electoral College. By focusing campaign efforts on competitive states, candidates are compelled to address the concerns of a larger and more diverse range of voters. This system encourages a more thorough examination of issues and a greater level of engagement on the part of voters in these states. Swing states become critical in deciding the outcome of the election, making them more influential and ensuring that candidates cater to their needs and concerns.

Additionally, the Electoral College provides balance between large and small states. Without this system, large states would have an excessive influence on the election due to their larger populations. The use of electoral votes ensures that smaller states are not neglected or overshadowed. The Electoral College provides an opportunity for candidates to address the specific concerns of all states, regardless of their size or population. This ensures a fair representation of all citizens in the election process.

Finally, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, the Electoral College ensures that a clear winner emerges. This prevents the complexity and uncertainty associated with run-off elections. By providing a decisive result, the Electoral College allows for a smooth transition of power and minimizes the potential for political turmoil.

While there are valid arguments against the Electoral College, such as the winner-take-all system limiting voter influence and the potential for electors to defy the will of the people, the advantages outlined above outweigh these concerns. The Electoral College provides a stable and predictable method of selecting the president, encourages candidates to appeal to a wide range of voters, and ensures fair representation across states of varying sizes.

In conclusion, I urge you to support the retention of the Electoral College. Its practical benefits outweigh the arguments for a popular vote system. The Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome, promotes a broader representation of the nation's interests, encourages engagement in swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and eliminates the need for run-off elections. Please consider these points when making decisions regarding this important issue.

Subject: Importance of Keeping the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to discuss a crucial issue that has been the subject of much debate and discussion in recent years - the future of the Electoral College. As a concerned citizen and a firm believer in the importance of preserving our democratic system, I would like to argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College, rather than changing to a popular vote system for the election of the President of the United States.

The Electoral College, as established by our founding fathers in the Constitution, is a process that strikes a balance between electing the President by a vote in Congress and a popular vote of qualified citizens. It consists of the selection of electors, their meeting and voting for the President and Vice President, and the subsequent counting of electoral votes by Congress. It ensures that each state has representation and that all regions are considered in the election process.

One of the primary reasons to retain the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. This is due to the winner-take-all system, where the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College tends to exceed their share of the popular vote. This system provides a clear winner and reduces the probability of a tied election.

Another important benefit of the Electoral College is that it ensures that the President elected has trans-regional appeal. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a President, and as a result, candidates are obliged to campaign across the country and appeal to different regions. This requirement fosters a sense of representation for all citizens, preventing regional favorites from monopolizing the election and ensuring that the President represents the entire nation.

Furthermore, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. These toss-up states receive more attention and give a voice to thoughtful voters who pay close attention to campaigns. By concentrating on swing states, candidates must listen to the concerns and needs of these voters, resulting in policies that are more representative of the diverse interests of the nation.

The Electoral College also balances the influence of large and small states. It allows candidates to give due attention to large states, where their policies and actions may have a larger impact due to their population size. This system restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states may lose due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate. It ensures that states of varying sizes have a voice in the election process.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, the Electoral College produces a clear winner. This prevents further complications and expenses associated with holding run-off elections, providing a swift and decisive result.

While critics argue that the Electoral College is outdated and unfair, I believe that these criticisms fail to consider the broader implications of changing to a popular vote system. Eliminating the Electoral College would shift the focus of campaigns solely to densely populated urban areas, leaving less populated rural areas with little to no representation. This would further exacerbate the division between urban and rural populations, potentially leading to political unrest and widening the gap between different regions of our nation.

In conclusion, keeping the Electoral College is crucial for the health and stability of our democratic system. It ensures certainty of outcome, trans-regional appeal, representation for swing states, balance between large and small states, and the avoidance of run-off elections. It is essential to preserve the core principles of our Founding Fathers' vision and uphold the integrity of our electoral process.

I kindly request that you consider these points when evaluating any future legislation or proposals regarding the Electoral College. It is imperative that we protect the interests and voices of all Americans in the election process.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I have faith in your dedication to serving the best interests of our state and our great nation.

In this essay, I will explore the benefits of taking breaks and how it can improve the quality of work and creativity, as well as the physical and mental health benefits of taking breaks. I will also examine the arguments in favor of an always-working mentality and explore how taking breaks can improve such a mindset.

Firstly, taking breaks can significantly improve the quality of work and creativity. When we work for extended periods, our minds become fatigued and our productivity declines. Taking breaks, on the other hand, allows our minds to rest and recharge, leading to improved focus and productivity upon returning to work. Additionally, taking breaks can lead to increased creativity and innovation, as our minds are able to think outside the box and come up with new ideas.

Secondly, taking breaks has numerous physical and mental health benefits. Prolonged periods of sitting and working can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, which can increase the risk of obesity, heart disease, and other health problems. Taking breaks can help alleviate these risks by allowing us to move around and stretch our muscles. Additionally, taking breaks can reduce stress and anxiety, which can have negative effects on our mental health.

Despite these benefits, there are arguments in favor of an always-working mentality. Some people believe that taking breaks can lead to a lack of discipline and a decrease in productivity. However, this is not necessarily the case. Taking breaks can actually improve our productivity by allowing our minds to rest and recharge. Additionally, taking breaks can lead to increased motivation and a sense of accomplishment, which can improve our overall sense of well-being.

Personally, I have experienced the benefits of taking breaks firsthand. When I work for extended periods without taking breaks, my productivity declines and my mind becomes fatigued. However, when I take breaks, I am able to recharge and come back to work with renewed focus and energy. Additionally, taking breaks has allowed me to maintain a healthy work-life balance, which has improved my overall well-being.

In conclusion, taking breaks is essential for maintaining our physical and mental health, as well as improving the quality of our work and creativity. While there are arguments in favor of an",1,0.9946696,1,True
F2DE30047DF9,"Extending the school day to two hours has been a topic of discussion for many years. While some people believe that this would provide students with more time to learn and improve their grades, others argue that it would be detrimental to their focus and well-being. In this essay, I will explore the benefits and disadvantages of extending the school day and evaluate the likelihood of students being able to maintain focus during the extra time. I will also discuss if a four-day school week should be considered as an option.

One of the main benefits of extending the school day is that it would provide students with more time to learn and improve their grades. By having more time in the classroom, students would be able to complete more work, ask more questions, and receive more feedback from their teachers. This could lead to higher grades and a better overall academic performance. Additionally, students would have more time to study and prepare for exams, which could lead to better test scores.

However, there are also several disadvantages to extending the school day. One of the main concerns is that students may not be able to maintain focus during the extra time. Studies have shown that students' attention spans decrease as the day goes on, and adding two more hours to the school day could exacerbate this problem. This could lead to decreased productivity and a lower quality of learning. Additionally, some students may feel overwhelmed or stressed by the longer school day, which could negatively impact their mental health.

Another potential disadvantage of extending the school day is that it could lead to a four-day school week. While this may seem like a good idea, there are several potential problems with this option. For one, students may not be able to maintain the same level of learning and academic performance on a shorter school week. Additionally, some students may struggle to adjust to the new schedule and may experience anxiety or stress as a result.

In conclusion, while extending the school day to two hours may provide some benefits, such as more time to learn and improve grades, there are also several potential disadvantages, such as decreased focus and mental health concerns. Additionally, a four-day school week may not be a viable option for all students. It is important for schools and educators to carefully consider the potential benefits and drawbacks of extending the school day and to explore alternative options, such as a flexible schedule or increased support services, to",1,0.99451774,1,True
EBD07D2D103C,"In recent years, there has been a growing debate about the benefits of traditional classroom learning versus distance learning. While both methods have their advantages and disadvantages, I believe that traditional classroom learning is the better option for most students. In this essay, I will compare and contrast the two methods, list the pros and cons of each, and analyze how traditional classroom learning provides a better learning system for some students.

Traditional classroom learning provides a structured and disciplined learning environment that is conducive to effective learning. Students are required to attend class at specific times and are expected to complete assignments and participate in class discussions. This structure helps students stay on track and motivated to learn. In contrast, distance learning allows students to learn at their own pace and on their own schedule. While this flexibility can be beneficial for some students, it can also lead to procrastination and a lack of discipline.

One of the main advantages of traditional classroom learning is the opportunity for face-to-face interaction with teachers and peers. Teachers can provide immediate feedback and guidance, and peers can offer support and collaboration. This interaction can help students understand the material better and develop important social skills. Distance learning, on the other hand, relies heavily on technology and can feel isolating for some students.

Another benefit of traditional classroom learning is the ability to participate in group activities. Group projects and discussions can help students develop teamwork and communication skills, as well as provide opportunities for collaboration and problem-solving. While distance learning can also include group activities, the lack of face-to-face interaction can make it more difficult for students to work together effectively.

In conclusion, while distance learning has its advantages, traditional classroom learning provides a more structured and disciplined learning environment that is conducive to effective learning. The face-to-face interaction with teachers and peers, as well as the ability to participate in group activities, can help students understand the material better and develop important social skills.

CFD0D13D3180,"George Washington once said, “I have no other view than to improve our success by keeping the utmost vigilance…and resolving never to be discouraged.” This simple yet profound adage captures the concept of ""failure to failure equals success"", which implies that success is achieved through a series of failures. Indeed, many successful people from various realms of life have found success despite failing multiple times. 

Take for example the story of media mogul Oprah Winfrey, who was once fired from a local news station for being ""unfit for television"". This an inflection point for Oprah, who had failed and was ready to give up, but decided to keep pushing and eventually became an influential figure in the world of media and entertainment. Her mantra became, “Turn your wounds into wisdom.” 

These stories show us that success is achievable even after multiple failures.

C1959178FC53,"Having a balanced lifestyle of work and leisure activities is paramount to a healthy, fulfilling life. While work is necessary in order to make money and provide for ourselves and our families, it must be balanced with leisure activities in order to remain happy and healthy. 

Without balance, we can quickly become overwhelmed and burnt out either by dedicating too much of our time to work, or vice versa. Taking on too much work without finding time for leisure activities leads to increased stress and frustration, and can even lead to physical illnesses – such as headaches, fatigue, and a weakened immune system. Conversely, if we are not able to motivate ourselves to work, we will not be able to provide for ourselves and our families, causing immense financial and emotional strain. 

By balancing our work with leisure activities, we are able to remain happy and stress-free. Engaging in hobbies, spending time with friends and family, or even taking a walk around the block can help to relieve stress and create a more positive outlook on life. Furthermore, having the financial security and freedom that comes from being responsible and working hard also increases feelings of contentment.

In conclusion, it is clear that having a balanced lifestyle of both work and leisure activities is beneficial to our overall well-being. Making the conscious effort to maintain a balance lifestyle provides us with a sense of satisfaction, security, and joy.",1,0.9944807,1,True
CDAA99F49D42,"As an 8th grader, I find the idea of graduating from high school in three years instead of four to be both intriguing and intimidating. While some people might think that graduating early would be a breeze, I believe there are both benefits and drawbacks to consider.

One of the main benefits of graduating early is that it allows students to get a head start on their college education. For instance, some district high schools in my area offer programs that allow students to take college courses alongside their high school classes. These programs can help students save money on college tuition and get a taste of what college life is like before they even graduate from high school. Students who have taken advantage of these programs have reported feeling more prepared for the academic rigor of college and being able to get a jump-start on their college careers.

However, there are also some drawbacks to consider. For example, graduating early can be challenging, especially if the student is not used to the faster pace of college-level coursework. Additionally, some colleges and universities may not accept early graduates or may place them in remedial courses, which can be frustrating and set them back in their academic progress.

Another solution that some students take advantage of is online classes and night school. These options can be helpful for students who have busy schedules or who live far away from their high school. However, there are also some drawbacks to consider. For instance, online classes can be isolating, and students may miss out on the social interaction and face-to-face learning that comes with traditional classes. Additionally, night school can be challenging for students who have to balance schoolwork with other responsibilities, such as work or extracurricular activities.

In my opinion, the benefits of graduating early outweigh the drawbacks, but it's important to consider all the factors before making a decision. For instance, students who graduate early may have an advantage when it comes to college admissions, as they will have more time to focus on their college applications and may be able to take more challenging courses. Additionally, early graduates may have more time to explore their interests and passions, which can help them find their career paths.

As an eighth-grade student, it is important to consider the different career paths available to us. It is essential to choose a career that reflects our interests and abilities. In this essay, we will explore some of the career paths available to us and the education necessary for each one. We will also consider the pros and cons of making a career choice at a young age and the potential negative effects of forcing students into certain career paths.

One of the most popular career paths for students is becoming a doctor. To become a doctor, one must attend medical school and complete a residency program. This requires a strong education in biology, chemistry, and physics. The benefits of becoming a doctor include a high salary, job security, and the ability to help people. However, the downside is that it requires a lot of hard work and dedication, and the cost of medical school can be high.

Another popular career path for students is becoming an engineer. To become an engineer, one must attend college and earn a degree in engineering. This requires a strong education in math, science, and technology. The benefits of becoming an engineer include a high salary, job security, and the ability to design and build things. However, the downside is that it requires a lot of hard work and dedication, and the cost of college can be high.

A less traditional career path for students is becoming a musician. To become a musician, one does not necessarily need a formal education. However, it can be helpful to attend music school and receive training in music theory and performance. The benefits of becoming a musician include the ability to express oneself creatively, the potential for a successful career in the music industry, and the ability to make a positive impact on people through music. However, the downside is that it can be difficult to make a living as a musician, and the competition in the music industry can be fierce.

It is important to consider the pros and cons of making a career choice at a young age. On one hand, making a career choice at a young age can give students a sense of direction and purpose. It can also provide a clear path for achieving their goals. On the other hand, making a career choice at a young age can limit opportunities for exploration and personal growth. It can also lead to a lack of flexibility and adaptability in the workforce.

llama_70b_v1839,"The use of animals in scientific research is a controversial topic that has sparked heated debates among scholars, animal rights activists, and the general public. While some argue that animal research is necessary for medical advancements and scientific breakthroughs, others claim that it is unethical and inhumane. As a grade 10 student, I believe that the use of animals in scientific research should be limited and only permitted under strict ethical guidelines.

On the one hand, animal research has led to numerous medical breakthroughs and has saved countless human lives. Animal testing has played a vital role in the development of vaccines, medications, and surgical techniques. For instance, animal testing was instrumental in the development of the polio vaccine, which has eradicated a disease that once ravaged communities worldwide. Additionally, animal research has also been crucial in understanding the effects of drugs, alcohol, and tobacco on the human body.

On the other hand, the use of animals in scientific research raises ethical concerns. Animals used in research are often subjected to extreme cruelty, including injection with toxic substances, exposure to radiation, and dissection. Many animals are kept in small cages and are denied the opportunity to engage in natural behaviors, leading to psychological distress and boredom. Furthermore, animal research is not always necessary, and alternatives such as computer simulations, cell cultures, and human clinical trials can often be used instead.

To address these concerns, I believe that animal research should only be conducted under strict ethical guidelines. Researchers should use the 3Rs principle (replacement, reduction, and refinement) to minimize animal suffering. Alternatives to animal research should be explored and used whenever possible. Animals used in research should be treated with respect and care, and their welfare should be monitored closely.

In conclusion, while the use of animals in scientific research has led to important medical advancements, it is important to consider the ethical implications of such research. Animal research should be limited and conducted under strict ethical guidelines to minimize animal suffering.

Curfews: Keeping Teens Out of Trouble or Interfering with Their Lives?

Hey, so I know curfews are a thing that adults like to implement, but are they really necessary? Like, I get it, they want to keep us safe and all, but they can also be super unfair. So, let's break it down.

First, what are curfews? They're like, rules that say you gotta be home by a certain time. Like, my mom has a curfew of 10 PM on weekdays, and 11 PM on weekends. But why? Why do adults get to decide when we can and can't be out? It's not like they have to deal with the consequences of breaking the curfew.

Okay, so some people say curfews keep us out of trouble. Like, if we're not allowed to be out late, we won't get into fights or do drugs or anything bad. But, like, that's not always true. I know people who have gotten into trouble even when they're supposed to be home by curfew. It's like, curfews don't always work.

It's like, adults don't understand that we have stuff to do too. And what if you're the only one who can take care of your younger siblings? You can't just leave them home alone because of a curfew.

So, I think curfews can be beneficial in some ways, but they can also be really unfair. Like, they can keep us safe, but they can also interfere with our lives. It's like, adults need to understand that we're not just kids, we're people too. And we deserve to have some freedom.

Hey there!  As an 8th grader, I'm super excited to write this essay about the history of soccer and how it relates to physical education.  I know, I know, it might seem like a weird combination, but trust me, it's actually pretty cool! 😃

So, did you know that soccer has been around for like, forever?  It originated in ancient civilizations like Egypt, China, and Greece! 🤯 It's crazy to think about how a sport that's so popular today has such a rich history. 

But here's the thing: soccer isn't just some ancient game that we play for fun.  It's actually a great way to build skills like teamwork, speed, and agility!  When you play soccer, you have to work together with your teammates to score goals and defend your team's net.  It's like a big game of tag, but with better ball handling skills! 😉

And get this: research shows that participating in physical education can actually lead to enjoyment!  Like, who knew?! It's not just about running laps or doing push-ups.  It's about having fun and staying active.  When you're having fun, you're more likely to stick with it and make it a part of your daily routine. 

Now, I know some people might be thinking, ""But wait, don't the rules of physical education and soccer clash?""  Not really!  Both involve working together as a team, but the rules of soccer are actually more relaxed than you might think.  For example, in soccer, you can use your hands to control the ball, but in physical education, you have to stay inside the designated playing area.  It's all about finding that balance between having fun and following the rules.

Policy 1 is stricter with its limitations on how phones and gadgets are used during school hours, such as preventing the phone from being used during class time unless specified by the teacher. This is beneficial as it allows students to understand the expectations of phone use in the school. In contrast, Policy 2 may be seen as more lenient in its approach, allowing the phone to be used more freely. However, if boundaries are not outlined, students may not have a full understanding of the limitations of phone use and could end up violating the policy and receiving a punishment. 

Students should be educated on their responsibilities when using their phones or gadgets at school, regardless of the policy. A key advantage of Policy 1 is that it clearly defines boundaries from the start, providing students with the information they need to make sure they are following the rules. Policy 2 has the potential to make it difficult for students to be aware of the limits, thus, leaving them open to breaking the rules. 

In conclusion, Policy 1 is the better choice for students to ensure that they are not breaking the rules of school. It establishes a clear set of expectations and students are able to understand their responsibilities better, thus reducing the possibility of violations. The importance of knowing your limitations when using phones or gadgets in school cannot be overstated.",1,0.99387854,1,True

EF47AB98271A,"Making changes in life is a difficult and often daunting task. It requires a lot of courage, determination, and self-discipline. However, it is also possible to make changes in life and achieve great success. In this essay, I will explore the possibilities of making changes and how to do so effectively.

One of the main reasons why people resist making changes is because they are afraid of the unknown. They fear that they may not be able to handle the new challenges and responsibilities that come with it. However, it is important to remember that change is inevitable and that it is better to embrace it than to resist it. By making changes, we can improve our lives and achieve our goals and dreams.

One of the best ways to make changes in life is to set clear and achievable goals. Goals give us a sense of direction and purpose, and they help us to stay motivated and focused. When setting goals, it is important to be specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). This will help you to create a clear roadmap for success and ensure that you are making progress towards your goals.

Another important aspect of making changes is to take action. It is not enough to just talk about making changes; we need to actually do something about it. This means taking small steps towards your goals every day, even if they seem insignificant. Consistent effort and persistence will eventually lead to significant results.

Making changes can also lead to new opportunities and experiences. When we step outside of our comfort zones and try new things, we open ourselves up to new possibilities and learn new skills. This can lead to new job opportunities, new friendships, and new adventures. By embracing change and taking risks, we can expand our horizons and achieve great things.

In conclusion, making changes in life is possible and can lead to great success. By setting clear and achievable goals, taking action, and embracing change, we can improve our lives and achieve our goals and dreams. So don't be afraid to make changes and take risks – it may be the best decision you ever make.",1,0.9944406,1,True
llama_70b_v11081,"I think the minimum wage should be raised in our country. The minimum wage is the lowest amount of money that an employer is legally required to pay their employees. It's not fair that people who work hard every day can't even earn enough to live a decent life.

One reason why the minimum wage should be raised is that it would help reduce poverty. Many people who work minimum wage jobs are struggling to make ends meet. They have to work multiple jobs just to pay for basic things like food, housing, and healthcare. If the minimum wage was higher, they would have more money to support themselves and their families, and they wouldn't have to work so many hours.

Another reason is that it would help promote fairness and equality. Women and minorities are often paid less than men for the same work, and raising the minimum wage would help to close that gap. It would also help to reduce discrimination against certain groups, like immigrants and people with disabilities.

Additionally, raising the minimum wage would boost the economy. When people have more money, they are more likely to spend it, which can help businesses grow and create more jobs. It would also reduce the amount of money that the government has to spend on social welfare programs, because people would be able to support themselves.

However, some people argue that raising the minimum wage could lead to job losses. They say that employers wouldn't be able to afford to pay their employees the higher wage, and would have to lay them off. But, this isn't necessarily true. Many studies have shown that raising the minimum wage doesn't lead to significant job losses. In fact, it could actually lead to more jobs being created, as businesses expand to meet the demand of a growing economy.

In conclusion, raising the minimum wage would be a positive change for our country. It would help reduce poverty, promote fairness and equality, boost the economy, and create more jobs. It's important that we make sure that everyone has the opportunity to earn a decent living, and raising the minimum wage is a step in the right direction.",1,0.9940386,1,True

Career Goals: What I Want to Be When I Grow Up!

Hey there! So, you know how people always ask you what you want to be when you grow up? Like, what's your dream job? Well, I've been thinking about it a lot lately, and I have a pretty good idea of what I want to do when I'm older. I mean, I'm only in 8th grade right now, but I'm already starting to think about my future.

So, I've been doing some research and there are just so many cool career options out there! Like, did you know that you can be a video game designer? Or a marine biologist? Or even a professional athlete?! It's crazy! But, I think I'm leaning towards something in the medical field. I'm really interested in how things work in the human body and how to make it better. So, maybe I'll be a doctor or a nurse practitioner.

But, here's the thing... my parents are both accountants. Like, they're always talking about numbers and stuff. And, I'm pretty good at math too! So, maybe I could be an accountant too! It's like, a stable job that pays well and everything. But, I don't know... I don't want to do the same thing as my parents. I want to do something that makes me happy.

So, I've been thinking about taking some courses in high school that will help me achieve my career goals. Like, I could take biology and chemistry to learn more about the human body and how it works. And, I could take some business classes to learn more about accounting and stuff. And, maybe even some computer science classes to learn how to make video games!

But, the thing is... high school can be really distracting. Like, there are so many things to focus on and it's hard to stay on track. So, I need to make sure I stay focused on my career goals. Maybe I can make a vision board or something to remind me of what I want to achieve.",1,0.9936666,1,True

Also, have you heard about all the data breaches and stuff that happen on social media? It's like, your personal information is out there for anyone to see! That's not okay. We should be able to trust that our private info is safe and secure.

I know some people might argue that privacy protections would infringe on our freedom of speech or something, but I don't think that's true. We can still have the freedom to share what we want, but we should also have the right to control who sees it. It's all about balance, you know?

8d0dd243,"The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage in cities and suburbs can have numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. The articles ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky, and ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal provide evidence and examples of the benefits of reducing car dependence.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. According to the articles, passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, particularly in suburban areas, emissions can be greatly reduced. For example, in the German suburb of Vauban, where car ownership is limited, 70% of families do not own cars. This has resulted in a significant decrease in emissions and a more environmentally-friendly community.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is improved air quality. In the city of Paris, a partial driving ban was enforced in response to high levels of smog. The ban led to a 60% decrease in congestion and a significant improvement in air quality. Similar initiatives have been implemented in other cities, such as Bogota, Colombia, where a car-free day was introduced to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. These examples demonstrate that by reducing car usage, cities can experience better air quality and a healthier environment.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to more compact and accessible communities. In the German suburb of Vauban, stores are placed within walking distance on a main street, rather than in distant malls. This promotes a pedestrian-friendly environment and encourages people to walk or use public transportation instead of relying on cars. In addition, limiting car usage can reduce traffic congestion and the need for extensive parking spaces, allowing for more efficient land use and the development of other amenities, such as parks and sports centers. 

There are also economic benefits to limiting car usage. In Paris, delivery companies complained of lost revenue due to the driving ban, but exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. This shows that by promoting alternative transportation options, such as electric vehicles and carpooling, cities can support innovative industries and reduce reliance on traditional car usage.

Overall, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, more compact and accessible communities, and economic benefits. As cities and suburbs around the world implement initiatives to reduce car dependence, it becomes clear that these measures not only benefit individuals and the environment, but also lead to more sustainable and livable communities.",1,0.98760265,1,True
E0E060143B79,"Failure is a natural part of life, and it is something that many people experience at some point in their lives. However, it is important to remember that failure is not the end of the road, but rather an opportunity for growth and success. In fact, many successful people have experienced failure at some point in their lives, and they have used that experience to fuel their success.

One of the main ways that failure can lead to success is through the process of learning. When we fail, we are forced to take a closer look at what went wrong and try to understand why. This process of reflection can help us identify areas where we need to improve and make changes to our approach. By learning from our mistakes, we can become better at what we do and increase our chances of success in the future.

Another way that failure can lead to success is through the development of resilience. When we experience failure, it can be easy to become discouraged and give up. However, successful people have learned to push through difficult times and keep trying, even when things are not going well. By developing resilience, we can overcome obstacles and continue to work towards our goals, even in the face of failure.

Enthusiasm and try are also important factors in achieving success. Enthusiasm is the driving force behind any successful endeavor. Without enthusiasm, it can be difficult to stay motivated and committed to our goals. By being enthusiastic about what we do, we are more likely to put in the effort and hard work needed to achieve success.

Try is also an important factor in achieving success. It is easy to give up when things get tough, but successful people have learned to keep trying, even when things are not going well. By persisting in the face of failure, we can eventually overcome obstacles and achieve our goals.

In conclusion, failure is a natural part of life, but it is not the end of the road. Rather, it is an opportunity for growth and success.

However, with the advent of the digital age, the role of libraries has come under scrutiny. Some argue that with the internet and digital resources, libraries are no longer necessary. But, I strongly disagree with this viewpoint. Libraries continue to play an essential role in society and are just as relevant today as they have always been.

Firstly, libraries provide a quiet and conducive environment for learning and studying. In today's world, where distractions are aplenty, libraries offer a peaceful refuge for students and researchers to focus on their work. The internet, although a valuable resource, can be a distraction with its endless stream of notifications, social media updates, and clickbait articles. Libraries, on the other hand, provide a space where people can concentrate without interruptions, allowing them to delve deeper into their work and learn more effectively.

Secondly, libraries offer a vast array of resources that are not readily available on the internet. Although the internet has made information more accessible, it has also created an ocean of misinformation. Libraries, through their carefully curated collections, provide a trusted source of information. They offer a range of books, journals, and databases that are not easily accessible online. Additionally, libraries often have rare and special collections that are invaluable to researchers. These resources are not readily available online and are often exclusive to libraries.

Thirdly, libraries play a crucial role in promoting literacy and education. They offer a range of programs and services that cater to people of all ages. From storytime for children to book clubs for adults, libraries provide a platform for people to engage with literature and enhance their reading skills. They also offer computer literacy classes, online resources, and databases that aid in education and professional development. These services are especially important for people who do not have access to the internet or lack the skills to navigate it effectively.

Finally, libraries are an integral part of the community. They serve as a hub for people to come together, share ideas, and engage in discussions. They host author talks, book signings, and other events that promote intellectual discourse and cultural enrichment. Libraries also provide a safe space for people to gather and seek refuge during times of crisis. For example, during the pandemic, libraries served as a sanctuary for people who needed a safe and quiet place to work, study, and relax.

In conclusion, while the digital age has transformed the way we access information, libraries continue to play a vital role in society. They provide a peaceful environment for learning, offer a vast array of resources, promote literacy and education, and serve as a community hub.

9. Perform in the chorus and enjoy the experience.

Introduction

As an eighth-grade student, I have always had a passion for music, especially singing. I have always enjoyed listening to music and singing along to my favorite songs. However, I have never had any formal training in singing, and I wanted to improve my skills. Therefore, I decided to join a chorus class at my nearby school. In this essay, I will discuss the benefits of joining a chorus class, the different types of chorus classes offered at my school, and how to choose the best chorus class for me.

Benefits of Joining a Chorus Class

Joining a chorus class has numerous benefits. Firstly, it is an excellent way to improve my singing skills. Chorus classes are designed to teach students proper singing techniques, such as breathing, posture, and vocal projection. This will help me to develop a stronger and more confident voice. Additionally, singing in a chorus allows me to learn new songs and harmonies, which will help me to expand my musical knowledge and appreciation.

Secondly, joining a chorus class can help me to develop social skills. Singing in a group requires teamwork, cooperation, and communication. This will help me to build relationships with other students and learn how to work effectively in a group setting. Furthermore, singing in a chorus can also help me to develop self-confidence and self-esteem. Performing in front of an audience can be nerve-wracking, but singing in a chorus can help me to overcome my fears and feel more comfortable performing in front of others.

Types of Chorus Classes Offered at My School

My school offers several different types of chorus classes, including concert choir, show choir, and jazz choir. Concert choir is the most traditional type of chorus class, and it is designed to focus on classical music and vocal technique. Show choir is a more performance-based class, and it incorporates dance and choreography into the singing. Jazz choir is a more specialized type of chorus class, and it focuses on jazz music and improvisation.

While some people argue that distance learning is only beneficial for students who are self-motivated, I believe that it has significant benefits for students with physical disabilities and/or economic limitations. In this essay, I will argue that distance learning offers these students more flexibility, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness, making it an excellent option for them to attend classes from home.

Firstly, distance learning provides students with physical disabilities and/or economic limitations more flexibility in their schedules. Students with physical disabilities may have difficulty attending classes in person due to transportation or accessibility issues. Distance learning allows them to attend classes from the comfort of their own homes, at a time that suits them best. This flexibility can also be beneficial for students with economic limitations, who may have to work part-time or full-time jobs to support themselves or their families. Distance learning allows them to balance their studies with their work commitments, making it easier for them to attend classes regularly.

Secondly, distance learning provides students with physical disabilities and/or economic limitations more accessibility to education. Traditional classroom settings may not be accessible to students with physical disabilities, as they may not have the necessary equipment or facilities. Distance learning eliminates these barriers, allowing all students to access education regardless of their physical abilities. Additionally, students with economic limitations may not have access to the same resources as their peers, such as textbooks or technology. Distance learning provides them with equal access to education, regardless of their financial situation.

Lastly, distance learning can be more cost-effective for students with physical disabilities and/or economic limitations. Traditional classroom settings can be expensive, with costs including tuition, transportation, and textbooks. Distance learning eliminates these costs, making education more accessible to students who may not have the financial resources to attend classes in person. Additionally, students with physical disabilities may have to pay for specialized equipment or accommodations, which can be expensive. Distance learning eliminates these costs, making education more affordable for all students.

In conclusion, distance learning has significant benefits for students with physical disabilities and/or economic limitations. It provides them with more flexibility, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness, making it an excellent option for them to attend classes from home.",1,0.9945045,1,True

Another thing we could do is, like, incorporate real-life examples into our lessons!  For instance, if we're learning about measuring volume, we could use, like, cups and water to show how to measure volume in a real-life situation!  It makes learning more relatable and easier to understand!

I'm writting to you today to give my opinion on the posible policy change that you are thinking about. I think it would be unfair to not let students participate in sports or other activities if they don't have at least a B average.

First of all, not every student is good at school. Some people are really good at sports, and that's what they enjoy. If they can't play sports, they might not have anything to look forward to at school. Also, maybe they are trying their best and getting C's, but they still won't be able to do what they love. That would suck.

Another reason why this policy change wouldn't be good is because it would be unfair to students who have learning disabilites. Some people can try their hardest and still not get good grades because they have dyslexia or something else that makes school hard for them. It's not fair to punish them for something they can't control.

Additionally, this policy would be bad because it would be too strict. Some students might have bad days or bad weeks and get a few bad grades, and then they would be banned from sports. That's not right. Everyone has bad days sometimes.

I think it would be better to find other ways to motivate students to do well in school. Maybe you could give rewards to students who get good grades, like a free pass to a game or something like that. That way, students would try harder because they would want the reward.

In conclusion, I don't think requiring at least a grade B average to participate in sports or other activities is a good idea. I think it's important to be fair to all students and to find other ways to motivate them to do well in school.

In this essay, I will explore the positive effects of technology on humanity, using examples of how it has changed our lifestyle, supported knowledge, and contributed to the economy.

One of the most significant ways that technology has impacted our lives is by changing the way we communicate and connect with others. With the advent of social media, messaging apps, and video conferencing software, we are now able to connect with people from all over the world in real-time. This has made it easier for us to maintain relationships with friends and family, collaborate with colleagues, and even form new connections with people we might never have met otherwise.

Another way that technology has changed our lifestyle is by making it easier for us to access information and knowledge. With the internet, we now have instant access to a wealth of information on virtually any topic.

Online classes and video conferencing have become increasingly popular for students who are unable to attend school in person. While these options offer some benefits, they also have their drawbacks. In this essay, I will explore the pros and cons of taking classes online or via video conferencing for those who are unable to attend school in person.

One of the biggest pros of taking classes online or via video conferencing is the flexibility they offer. Students can take classes from the comfort of their own homes, without having to worry about commuting to school every day. This can be especially helpful for students who have busy schedules or who live far away from school. Additionally, online classes can be more convenient for students who have health issues or who are unable to attend school in person due to other reasons.

Another pro of online classes is the access to a wider range of courses. Some schools may not offer certain courses in person, but they may offer them online. This can be especially helpful for students who are interested in a particular subject but cannot take it in person. Online classes also offer the opportunity to take classes from other schools or universities, which can provide a more diverse learning experience.

However, there are also some cons to taking classes online or via video conferencing. One of the biggest cons is the lack of face-to-face interaction with teachers and classmates. While video conferencing can provide a sense of connection, it can also be isolating for students who are used to interacting with their peers in person. Additionally, online classes can be more difficult to stay focused in, as there are no physical boundaries to separate students from distractions at home.

Another con of online classes is the potential for technical issues. Depending on the quality of the internet connection, students may experience delays or connectivity issues during classes. This can be frustrating and can disrupt the learning experience.

llama_70b_v1940,"The Facial Action Coding System is a new technology that can identify human emotions. It's like a computer can read your face! In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author talks about how this technology works and how it can be used. I think it's really cool, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea to use it in a classroom.

On the one hand, this technology could be super helpful for teachers. Imagine if your teacher could tell if you're confused or bored just by looking at your face! They could adjust their lesson plan to make sure everyone understands and is engaged. It could also help them spot if someone is feeling sad or anxious, and they could offer support. That's really important, because sometimes students might not want to talk about how they're feeling.

On the other hand, I think it's a little creepy that a computer can read my emotions. What if it's wrong? What if it thinks I'm bored when I'm actually just thinking deeply? What if it thinks I'm confused when I'm actually just daydreaming? It's also a little scary to think about all the data that would be collected. Who would have access to it? How would it be used?

I also worry that this technology could be used to punish students. Like, if a student is caught looking bored or distracted, they might get in trouble. That wouldn't be fair, because maybe they're just having a bad day or they're struggling with the material. It's important for teachers to understand that students are human beings, and we have good days and bad days.

I think it's important for schools to have policies in place to protect student privacy and data security. They should make sure that students and parents are aware of how the technology is being used and what data is being collected. And they should definitely get consent from students and parents before using this technology in the classroom.

In conclusion, while the Facial Action Coding System technology is really cool and could potentially be helpful in a classroom, I think it's important to think carefully about how it's used.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures the certainty of outcome in the election process. As stated by Judge Richard A. Posner, disputes over the outcome of an Electoral College vote are less likely to occur compared to a dispute over the popular vote. This is due to the fact that the winner's share of the Electoral College generally exceeds their share of the popular vote. With a majority of electoral votes being required to elect the President, there is a higher level of certainty in determining the winner (Posner 18).

Furthermore, the Electoral College fosters a sense of collective ownership and representation for all citizens across the nation. As Judge Posner highlights, the Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, ensuring that no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This prevents a candidate with only regional favoritism from becoming president, promoting a more inclusive leadership that considers the interests of all regions (Posner 19).

Another significant advantage of the Electoral College is its ability to emphasize the importance of swing states. As noted by Judge Posner, the winner-take-all method motivates candidates to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states. This encourages voters in these states to pay close attention to the campaign, leading to more thoughtful and informed decisions. Toss-up states become the deciding factor in the election, ensuring that the most thoughtful voters have the power to shape the outcome (Posner 20).

Additionally, the Electoral College grants due importance to large states. Judge Posner explains how the Electoral College balances the weight of large states losing representation due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate. Large states receive more attention from presidential candidates during campaigns, as their victories yield a higher number of electoral votes. This maintains a political balance that acknowledges the diverse needs and interests of both small and large states (Posner 21).

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate achieves a majority of the popular votes, this could lead to further complications in the election process. With the Electoral College, the clear winner is determined based on the majority of electoral votes received, ensuring a decisive outcome (Posner 22).

While some argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in ""non-competitive"" states, the fact remains that people vote to express their political preference rather than in the belief that their vote alone will decide the election (Posner 23). The Electoral College system upholds the fundamentals of our democratic process while maintaining a fair and effective means to elect the President.

In conclusion, the Electoral College should be preserved as the method of electing the President of the United States. Its ability to ensure certainty, foster unity and representation, highlight swing states, provide importance to large states, and avoid run-off elections are all valuable advantages that contribute to the effectiveness of our democratic system.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I hope that you will carefully consider the benefits of maintaining the Electoral College in future discussions on this issue.

llama_70b_v1884,"Social media has taken over our lives, and its impact on society cannot be ignored. Social media platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter have become an integral part of our daily routine, and their influence extends far beyond just sharing updates and connecting with friends. Social media has the power to shape societal norms and values, and it's essential to acknowledge both the positive and negative effects it has on our culture.

On the positive side, social media has made it easier for people to connect with each other, regardless of their geographical location. It has provided a platform for people to voice their opinions and bring attention to social justice issues that might have otherwise gone unnoticed. Social media has also made it possible for businesses to reach a wider audience, creating new job opportunities and contributing to economic growth.

However, there are also several negative effects of social media on society. Social media platforms often promote unrealistic beauty standards and perpetuate harmful stereotypes, which can lead to body image issues, low self-esteem, and mental health problems. Cyberbullying is another harmful consequence of social media, which can result in feelings of isolation, depression, and even suicidal thoughts among young people.

Moreover, social media has contributed to the decline of face-to-face communication, making people more comfortable interacting with their screens than with real people. This can lead to a lack of empathy and social skills, which are essential for building strong relationships and contributing to society.

Social media has also created a culture of instant gratification, where people expect immediate responses and likes. This can lead to people prioritizing quantity over quality, sacrificing meaningful connections for the sake of popularity. Additionally, the constant stream of information on social media can be overwhelming, leading to a sense of burnout and decreased productivity.

In conclusion, social media has a significant impact on societal norms and values. While it has brought people closer and provided opportunities for businesses and social justice movements, it also has negative consequences such as promoting unrealistic beauty standards, perpetuating harmful stereotypes, declining face-to-face communication, and creating a culture of instant gratification. It's up to us to use social media responsibly, acknowledging both its benefits and drawbacks, and working to mitigate its negative effects on our society.

As a grade 10 student, I believe that social media has a significant impact on societal norms and values. It is essential for us to understand both the positive and negative effects it has on our culture, and to use it responsibly to ensure that we can enjoy its benefits while minimizing its negative impact.",1,0.9946391,1,True
CEFDC545C24F,"One potential benefit of having a longer school day for high school students is that they would have more time to learn the subject material. With the extra two hours, students could spend more time on the subjects of their choosing and focus more on making progress and improving their grades. Furthermore, additional support can be provided by teachers, who can devote more time to helping students develop their understanding of the material. 

On the other hand, there are some potential disadvantages associated with a longer school day. Students may face added stress if the extra two hours are used to add more coursework or other requirements. This could make it difficult for students to balance their school work with extracurricular activities and time to relax.

Firstly, some students may not have the time or energy to participate in extracurricular activities due to their academic workload or personal commitments. For example, a student who is struggling with their grades may need to spend more time studying and completing homework assignments, leaving little time for extracurricular activities.

Secondly, some students may not have an interest in any of the extracurricular activities offered by the school. Forcing students to participate in an activity that they are not interested in can lead to a lack of motivation and engagement, which can ultimately have a negative impact on their academic performance.

Lastly, some students may not have the financial resources to participate in extracurricular activities. Some activities, such as sports, require expensive equipment or uniforms, which not all families can afford.

C6DDD966C9FC,"Working together is undoubtedly more beneficial than working alone. When individuals collaborate, they can accomplish more in less time and with better results. Here are some reasons why:

Firstly, working together reduces the amount of work. When everyone contributes to a task, the load is shared among team members, making it easier to complete. For instance, if a group of students are working on a project, they can divide the tasks among themselves, allowing each person to focus on their specific area of expertise. This not only saves time but also helps to avoid burnout.

Secondly, working together promotes efficiency. When people work together, they can bounce ideas off each other, share resources, and learn from one another. This leads to a more productive and streamlined process, resulting in a better end product. For example, a group of students working on a science fair project can share their research findings and build upon each other's ideas to come up with a more comprehensive and innovative project.

Thirdly, working together creates opportunities to utilize diverse skill sets. When individuals with different strengths and weaknesses work together, they can complement each other's abilities, leading to a more well-rounded and effective team. For instance, a group of students with different talents and interests can work together on a music project, with one person handling the lyrics, another person handling the melody, and another person handling the production.

Fourthly, working together provides constructive criticism for a better end result. When individuals work alone, they may not receive the same level of feedback and support as they would when working in a group. However, when working together, team members can provide constructive criticism and suggestions to improve the project, leading to a higher quality end result. For example, a group of students working on a school play can provide feedback on each other's acting, directing, and set design, resulting in a more polished and engaging performance.

While there are some advantages to working alone, such as increased focus and productivity, there are also circumstances where working together is more beneficial. For instance, when working on a complex project that requires a diverse range of skills, it may be more efficient to work in a group.

E57E60E07425,"The push to conserve resources and energy is well underway across many different institutions, from businesses to schools. Schools are particularly well suited to implement changes in practice that can significantly reduce energy usage, as many have already done through green renovations and adopting more sustainable practices. One proposal that is gaining traction is for schools to extend their day two hours, while shortening the school week to four days. This idea has both its benefits and drawbacks, and they should be carefully weighed before any policy is enacted. 

On the plus side, extending the school day by two hours, coupled with a four-day work week, can certainly help to conserve resources and energy. This is because the school building can be kept at a more stable temperature for longer periods of time while still opening and closing fewer days, and energy-intensive operations like air conditioning and lighting can be used less frequently and for shorter periods of time. This can also lead to cost savings for the school while being better for the environment overall. 

However, this proposal also comes with some drawbacks. For one, the extended school day would necessitate an extension of the school year, resulting in higher costs for the school in providing more instruction and greater disruption of winter and summer breaks. Additionally, while the four-day work week may offer more flexibility for teachers, it could create more stress for staff and administrators, who would have to fit more work into a shorter amount of time. Finally, students—particularly older students—may find it difficult to adjust to longer days. 

Ultimately, any proposed change in school policies should be evaluated carefully, and the potential advantages and disadvantages for energy and resource conservation should be taken into account. It is important to consider the various impacts of the extended school day and four-day work week proposal before any decisions are made.",1,0.9946083,1,True

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my opinion regarding the current debate surrounding the Electoral College and its role in the election of the President of the United States. As a concerned citizen, I believe that the Electoral College should be maintained, and I would like to present several reasons to support my stance.

First and foremost, the Electoral College ensures a certain degree of certainty in the outcome of the presidential election. While disputes over the popular vote can and have occurred, such conflicts are less likely in the case of the Electoral College. This is due to the fact that the winner's share of the Electoral College votes typically exceeds their share of the popular vote. With the majority of states using a winner-takes-all system, the chances of a nationwide tie in the Electoral College votes are highly unlikely.

Furthermore, the Electoral College promotes a sense of unity and representation for all regions of the country. By requiring a candidate to have trans-regional appeal, the Electoral College prevents a situation where one particular region has enough electoral votes to single-handedly elect a president. This system ensures that a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be successful, as they would not be able to effectively represent the interests of the entire nation. It encourages candidates to campaign in a wide range of states, making them accountable to the concerns and needs of citizens across the country.

In addition, the Electoral College system emphasizes the significance of swing states. By focusing campaign efforts on these states, candidates are able to directly engage with voters who hold considerable influence in deciding the election. This leads to a more informed and thoughtful electorate, as citizens in swing states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign and critically evaluate the competing candidates. The ability of swing states to determine the outcome prevents the presidency from being determined by a few densely populated areas while disregarding the concerns of citizens in other parts of the country.

Moreover, the Electoral College provides a fair balance between large and small states. The differential allocation of electoral votes based on population gives larger states a greater say in the election process. This ensures that candidates cannot solely focus on the needs of smaller, less populous states at the expense of larger ones. The Electoral College system recognizes that a state's size should be taken into account when considering its influence on the national level.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for runoff elections. Since the winning candidate must secure a majority of electoral votes, the system guarantees a clear winner. This avoids the complexity and potential division that would arise from additional rounds of voting if no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote.

While critics argue that the Electoral College can disenfranchise voters in states where their preferred candidate has no chance of winning, it is important to remember that individuals who vote in presidential elections typically do so to express their political preferences. The fact that not every vote swings a national election does not diminish the significance of individual citizens participating in the democratic process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College serves as a vital component of our democratic system and should be maintained. It provides certainty in the outcome of the election, ensures representation and unity across regions, promotes informed voting through swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and eliminates the need for runoff elections. The Electoral College system may not be perfect, but it strikes a balance that preserves the integrity of our national elections.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my perspective on this matter. I trust that you will carefully evaluate the arguments presented and make decisions that best serve the interests of our nation and its citizens.

However, excessive use of vehicles has a detrimental impact on our environment and our lives. Therefore, it is important to limit car usage for a better future. In this essay, I will explain the advantages of limiting car usage, which can be found in the provided passages.

Firstly, reducing car usage can benefit the environment. According to a study, vehicles are the biggest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, which can cause global warming. As stated in one of the passages, if everyone in the U.S. drove 10% less, it would be the equivalent of taking 28 billion pounds of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. Moreover, fewer cars on the road mean less pollution and cleaner air to breathe.

Secondly, limiting car usage can also have positive effects on our health. Walking, cycling or using public transportation instead of driving can increase physical activity and promote a healthier lifestyle. As per one of the passages, a study found that people who walk or bike for daily transportation have a lower risk of obesity and chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes.

Thirdly, reducing car usage can be financially beneficial. Owning and maintaining a car can be expensive for individuals as well as the government. The cost of building and maintaining roads, bridges, and highways can be reduced if fewer people use cars. Furthermore, using public transportation can save individuals money on gas, insurance, and car repairs.

In conclusion, reducing car usage has numerous advantages for our environment, our health, and our finances. It is important to limit car usage for a better future. We can use alternative modes of transportation such as public transportation, walking or cycling, which can be more sustainable and beneficial for our overall well-being. As a society, we must take necessary steps to reduce car usage for a cleaner and healthier future.",1,0.9936227,1,True

Failing can be a challenging experience, but it can also lead to success. There are many examples of individuals who have achieved great things in their lives after experiencing failure. For instance, Thomas Edison failed thousands of times before he successfully invented the light bulb. Similarly, J.K. Rowling's first Harry Potter book was rejected by several publishers before it eventually became a worldwide sensation.

While success and failure may seem similar on the surface, they have different effects on a person's life. Success can provide a sense of accomplishment and validation, while failure can be demotivating and discouraging. However, failure can also be a valuable learning experience that can help individuals develop resilience and perseverance.

The psychology of why some people are discouraged by failure is complex and multifaceted. Some people may have low self-esteem or a fear of failure, which can make it difficult for them to bounce back from setbacks. Others may lack the support or resources they need to overcome obstacles.

Despite these challenges, some people are able to use failure as a positive force in their lives. For example, many successful entrepreneurs have experienced multiple failures before achieving success. These individuals often view failure as a learning opportunity and use it to refine their strategies and improve their chances of success.

One example of someone who achieved success after failing is Steve Jobs. Jobs was fired from Apple in 1985, but he went on to co-found Pixar and later return to Apple to revitalize the company. His success can be attributed in part to his ability to learn from his failures and use that knowledge to achieve his goals.

Some people are not discouraged by failure because they understand that it is a natural part of life. They view failure as an opportunity to learn and grow, and they use it to develop a growth mindset. This mindset allows them to see challenges as opportunities for growth and development, rather than as obstacles to be overcome.

In conclusion, failure plays a crucial role in the journey towards success. While failure can be challenging and discouraging, it can also be a valuable learning experience that can help individuals develop resilience and perseverance. By learning from their failures and using that knowledge to achieve their goals, individuals can turn setbacks into stepping stones on",1,0.9946615,1,True

llama_70b_v1784,"Libraries have been around for centuries, providing people with access to knowledge and information. However, with the rise of digital technologies, some people have questioned the continued importance of libraries. In my opinion, libraries are still essential in the digital age.

Firstly, libraries provide a quiet and peaceful environment for studying and research. Despite the availability of online resources, many people find it difficult to concentrate and focus when using digital devices. Libraries offer a distraction-free space where people can immerse themselves in their work without interruptions. Additionally, libraries often have dedicated areas for studying, such as reading rooms and quiet areas, which are ideal for students who need to focus.

Secondly, libraries offer a wide range of resources that are not available online. While the internet provides access to a vast amount of information, not all of it is reliable or accurate. Libraries, on the other hand, have a curated collection of books, journals, and other resources that have been carefully selected and verified for their quality and accuracy. This makes them an invaluable resource for students and researchers who need to access credible and trustworthy information.

Thirdly, libraries provide access to technology and digital resources that may not be available to everyone. Many libraries offer computer and internet access, scanning and printing facilities, and digital databases that are not freely available online. This is especially important for people who do not have access to these resources at home, such as low-income families or those living in rural areas.

Finally, libraries play a vital role in promoting literacy and a love of reading. They offer a wide range of books and other materials that cater to different interests and reading levels, making them accessible to people of all ages. Additionally, libraries often host author talks, book clubs, and other events that promote literacy and encourage people to engage with books and reading.

In conclusion, libraries continue to play a vital role in the digital age. They provide a peaceful and focused environment for studying, access to reliable and accurate resources, technology and digital resources, and promote literacy and a love of reading. While digital technologies have certainly changed the way we access information, libraries remain an essential part of our society, providing a unique set of resources and services that cannot be replicated online.

Bad behaviors include being rude, disrespectful, and dishonest. These behaviors can be influenced by a variety of factors, including upbringing, environment, and personal experiences.

Bad influences can occur when people are exposed to negative role models or environments. For example, if a student is constantly surrounded by peers who are disrespectful and dishonest, they may begin to adopt those behaviors themselves. It is important for parents and true friends to be positive influences and to model good behavior.

Having good influences can have numerous benefits. For example, it can improve a person's mental health, increase their self-esteem, and improve their relationships with others. It can also lead to better academic performance and a more positive outlook on life.

However, sometimes people have a bad life and this results in their behavior. For example, if a student has experienced trauma or abuse, they may struggle to control their emotions and behavior. In these cases, it is important for parents and true friends to provide support and guidance. This can include talking to a therapist, seeking out positive role models, and practicing self-care.

In conclusion, being a compassionate friend is the best way to influence people to have good behavior. It is important to model good behavior and to be a positive influence in any setting. By doing so, we can create a more positive and supportive environment for everyone.",1,0.99454015,1,True
C6EB01B2D6B8,"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that having four days to learn with a two-hour extension versus five days to learn without an extension can have a significant impact on the outcomes of students. In this essay, I will evaluate the effects of extended hours on after school activities, mental and psychological abilities of students, and how it would benefit or harm the institution.

Firstly, extended hours can have a negative impact on after school activities. When students are given extra time to learn, they may feel pressured to complete all the material within the given time frame. This can lead to a lack of time for extracurricular activities, such as sports, music, or clubs. These activities are essential for the overall well-being of students, as they provide an opportunity to develop social skills, leadership, and teamwork. Therefore, if students are given more time to learn, it is crucial to ensure that they still have time for after school activities.

Secondly, extended hours can also have a negative impact on the mental and psychological abilities of students. When students are given more time to learn, they may become overwhelmed with the amount of material they need to cover. This can lead to stress, anxiety, and even burnout. Additionally, students may struggle to maintain a work-life balance, as they may feel like they need to spend all their free time studying. This can lead to a lack of sleep, which can negatively impact their academic performance and overall well-being. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that students have a reasonable amount of time to learn while still having time for rest and relaxation.

On the other hand, extended hours can also have some benefits. When students are given more time to learn, they may be able to better understand the material and retain it for longer periods. This can lead to improved academic performance and a better understanding of the subject matter. Additionally, extended hours can provide students with an opportunity to ask questions and seek help from their teachers. This can be especially beneficial for students who may be struggling with the material or who require additional support. Therefore, if students are given more time to learn, it is crucial to ensure that they have access to the resources and support they need to succeed.

In conclusion, the outcomes of students having four days to learn with a two-hour extension versus five days to learn without an extension can have a significant impact on after school activities, mental and psychological abilities",1,0.99441826,1,True

Subject: The Importance of the Electoral College in Presidential Elections

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and urge you to consider the benefits it brings to our democratic process. While some argue for a shift to a popular vote system, I believe that maintaining the Electoral College is crucial for ensuring a fair and balanced representation of the diverse interests of all states.

The Electoral College, as established by our founding fathers, serves as a compromise between election of the President by Congress or a purely popular vote. It consists of 538 electors, with a majority of 270 electoral votes required to win the presidency. The selection of electors is made by the states based on their Congressional representation, ensuring that smaller states have a voice in the election process. 

One of the main advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome it provides. A dispute over the popular vote is more likely to occur than a dispute over the Electoral College's results. The winner-take-all system in most states contributes to this certainty, as even a slight plurality in a state leads to a landslide electoral-vote victory. Additionally, the Electoral College avoids the issue of run-off elections, as it invariably produces a clear winner.

Furthermore, the Electoral College fosters the election of a president who has trans-regional appeal. With no region having enough electoral votes to secure a victory, candidates must have broad appeal across different regions of the country. This requirement ensures that the president represents all regions and prioritizes the interests of all Americans, not just a particular region.

The Electoral College system also places attention on swing states, where campaign efforts are concentrated. This focus on key states increases voter engagement in those states and encourages voters to thoroughly evaluate the candidates and their policies. By giving more power to swing states, we ensure that thoughtful and well-informed voters have a greater influence on the outcome of the election.

Moreover, the Electoral College balances the political weight between large and small states. While the Senate already provides some balance through mal-apportionment, the Electoral College further emphasizes the importance of large states in the political process. Candidates are compelled to pay attention to these states due to their higher number of electoral votes, granting citizens in large states a fair share of influence in presidential elections.

Lastly, abolishing the Electoral College would undermine the representation of states with smaller populations, and candidates would focus solely on populous regions and disregard the concerns of less populated areas. This could exacerbate divisions between urban and rural areas and lead to a concentration of power in heavily populated regions. The Electoral College ensures that the interests of all states, regardless of population size, are taken into account during presidential elections.

In conclusion, the Electoral College remains a critical component of our democratic system, striking a delicate balance between the popular vote and the interests of states. It guarantees a certainty of outcome, promotes trans-regional appeal, encourages voter engagement in swing states, provides balance between large and small states, and avoids run-off elections. I respectfully request that you consider the benefits outlined above when making decisions regarding the Electoral College.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will take my viewpoint into consideration when evaluating any potential changes to our presidential election process.

Sincerely,

CA29A62DA67B,"Recent studies suggest that the benefits of engaging in active activities far exceed the advantages of staying inactive. Active activities involve engaging in physical or mental activities that encourage interaction with others and direct involvement with the environment. Participating in activities such as sports, volunteer work, or creative endeavors has been found to lead to increased productivity, better physical health, and improved cognitive functioning. Conversely, the drawbacks of inactive activities can leave individuals feeling unfulfilled and out of touch with reality. 

In contrast, inactive activities such as reading, listening to music, watching television, and playing video games can serve a purpose in people's lives. These activities can provide valuable rest and relaxation, allowing people to recharge after a difficult day or and to gain a new perspective. In addition, accomplishments can be found within these activities. A person can strive to finish a book series or learn how to play a musical instrument. Furthermore, this type of activity can help to develop mental skills such as problem-solving, as well as aiding the development of physical skills like hand-eye coordination. 

Taking risks and facing fears can be a necessary part of learning and progressing. Discomfort and anxiety can help spur on growth and innovation, and can even be helpful in strengthening relationships. However, the consequences of taking risks can be anything from exhilaration to disappointment, so it's important to weigh the risks and rewards before deciding whether or not to take a risk.

Overall, understanding the consequences of taking risks versus staying inactive can help us better prepare for success. Knowing when to take a risk and when to stay safe has a great impact on our daily lives and can help us achieve both short-term and long-term goals. Knowing when and how to properly take risks and push through fears can open new doors and lead us to a better future.",1,0.9946042,1,True
falcon_180b_v1_333,"Introduction: The Face on Mars has been a topic of discussion for many years. Some people believe that it was created by aliens, while others think it is a natural landform. After reading the article 'Unmasking the Face on Mars,' I am convinced that the Face is just a natural landform.

Body Paragraph 1: The first reason why the Face is a natural landform is that it was formed due to erosion. According to the article, the Face was created by wind and water erosion over millions of years. The author also mentions that the Face has a similar structure to other landforms on Mars, which were also formed due to erosion.

Body Paragraph 2: The second reason why the Face is a natural landform is that it does not have any features that suggest it was created by aliens. The author states that there are no signs of intelligent life on Mars, and the Face does not have any markings or symbols that could indicate it was made by aliens.

Body Paragraph 3: The third reason why the Face is a natural landform is that it has been studied by scientists for many years. The author mentions that the Face was first discovered in 1976, and since then, it has been studied by NASA and other organizations. These studies have shown that the Face is a natural landform and not a creation of aliens.

Conclusion: In conclusion, the Face on Mars is a natural landform that was formed due to erosion. It does not have any features that suggest it was created by aliens, and it has been studied by scientists for many years. Therefore, it is safe to say that the Face is not a creation of aliens and is just a natural landform on Mars.",1,0.8040653,1,True
7203112033A1,"Distance education is, without a doubt, a great opportunity for students who are looking for an alternative to traditional learning. It is an innovative and growing form of education that can provide several benefits over traditional learning. There are many reasons why distance learning can be a good option rather than a bad one. 

For students who are being bullied at school, distance learning can provide a sense of security and peace of mind. It allows them to learn in a safe environment and enables them to have more control over their personal schedule, so they can study on their own time without fear of harassment. 

Additionally, distance learning can be immensely advantageous for students who for whatever reason live too far away from their school to attend regularly. It gives students the flexibility to work from anywhere and complete their course work on their own time. 

Moreover, students should consider trying distance learning as it may offer them an opportunity to pursue their educational aspirations and goals with cost efficiency. Although there are costs associated with distance learning, when comparing to the cost of attending a traditional institution, it may be less expensive in the long run. 

In conclusion, distance learning can be a great option for students who are looking for an alternative and cost-effective way to pursue their educational goals. It can provide safety and flexibility to those who are being bullied and those who have limited access to a brick and mortar school. With the variety of benefits distance learning offers, it's worth considering as a viable option.",1,0.99444795,1,True
B0B703E881B7,"Cell phones have become an integral part of our daily lives, with an ever-increasing penetration in our schools. On one hand, cell phones offer conveniences such as access to online resources, and can be used for educational tools such as apps, as well as an outlet for reporting instances of bullying or abuse. On the other hand, the use of cell phones in school can be distracting to students, and their misuse can result in cheating on exams and cyberbullying. 

The debate on allowing cell phones in school should consider the respective pros and cons, as well as the potential solutions to effectively manage the devices' use in an educational setting. Banning cell phones completely might be too extreme if the main concern is misuse, as confiscating them away from students would not hold oneself accountable to foster responsible behaviors. An alternate approach could be to allow the use of cell phones under teacher supervision, emphasizing the importance of appropriate usage in the classroom as a digital literacy skill and through the use of classroom policies. 

The prevalence of cell phones in school also gives rise to the use of alternative solutions, such as filtering applications and messaging services that limit distractions and inappropriate media access. These solutions are a way to create a balance between the potential misuse of cell phones in school, and their potential benefits as learning tools. It is also important to consider making resources available for students to learn proper internet safety, and for teachers to understand and accommodate the devices' use in the classroom. 

Overall, we cannot deny the advantages of cell phone use in school, but we should also recognize the potential risks if left unmanaged. By studying how to effectively manage the use of cell phones in an educational setting, and by implementing appropriate policies, we can ensure a safe and responsible learning environment for our students.",1,0.99430805,1,True

Ugh, I hate it when I have to make an effort. Like, why can't things just be easy? But, I guess that's not how life works. Sometimes I have to put in extra effort to do things, like studying for a test or practicing a sport. And you know what? It's not always fun. It can be really frustrating and stressful. But, you know what? It's worth it.

When I get praised for my efforts, it feels amazing. It's like, finally, all that hard work paid off. And it boosts my self-esteem. I feel like I can do anything. Like, I can take on the world. And it's not just about the praise itself, it's about the feeling of accomplishment. Knowing that I worked hard and achieved something makes me feel proud of myself.

But, it's not just about the praise. It's about the effort itself. When I put in the work and see the results, it makes me feel like I'm capable of anything. It gives me confidence. And confidence is key. Without it, I don't know where I'd be. I probably wouldn't be in 8th grade right now.

9702AD260172,"High school is a crucial time in a student's life. Not only does it provide an opportunity to learn and grow academically, but it also plays a significant role in shaping one's future career. Courses and daily life in high school can greatly influence a student's decision on what they want to pursue after graduation.

One of the most significant factors that can influence a student's career choice is the courses they take in high school. High school courses provide students with a taste of what they might be interested in pursuing in college. For example, if a student is interested in science and technology, they might take courses in biology, chemistry, and physics. These courses can give them a better understanding of what they want to do in the future and help them make informed decisions about their college major and career path.

Another factor that can influence a student's career choice is their daily life in high school. High school provides students with a variety of extracurricular activities and opportunities to get involved in their community. For example, if a student is interested in business, they might participate in a business club or volunteer at a local business. These experiences can give them valuable skills and insight into the field they are interested in.

Parental support can also play a significant role in a student's career choice. Parents can provide guidance and support to help their children make informed decisions about their future. They can also help their children connect with professionals in their field of interest and provide valuable advice on how to succeed in that field.

The importance of school staff cannot be overstated. Teachers and counselors can provide students with valuable guidance and support as they navigate the college application process and make decisions about their future. They can also help students connect with professionals in their field of interest and provide valuable advice on how to succeed in that field.

Finally, leaving a legacy is something that many students consider when making decisions about their future. They want to make a positive impact on the world and leave a lasting legacy that they can be proud of. This can be a powerful motivator when it comes to choosing a career.

It is our choices that help define our lives, shape our outlook on the world, and in some cases, even determine our destiny. However, making our own decisions can be a daunting task, fraught with challenges and difficulty. Decisions can be complex and require careful consideration, making them difficult to make quickly or on the fly. Additionally, the consequences of making the wrong decision can be catastrophic. 

In order to make better decisions, some people look to others for guidance and mentorship. Taking advice from people we trust can provide valuable insight and perspective and help to narrow down our choices. Other people just need more time; taking a step back and slowing down can allow the right decision to emerge. In addition, having an open and honest discussion with family and close friends can help support the decision-making process and provide clarity. 

No matter what approach is used, it is important to remember that the decision making process is highly personal and that the ultimate decision lies with the individual.

I strongly disagree with this viewpoint. In my opinion, libraries are just as important today as they were before the digital age.

Firstly, libraries provide a quiet and peaceful environment for studying and research. In today's world, where distractions are plenty, it's hard to find a place where you can focus without interruptions. Libraries offer a serene atmosphere that fosters concentration and learning. Additionally, libraries have trained librarians who can assist you in finding the right resources and information, something that the internet cannot always provide accurately.

Secondly, libraries offer a vast array of resources that are not available online. Many books, especially rare and old ones, are not digitized and can only be found in libraries. Moreover, libraries often subscribe to academic databases and journals that are not accessible to the general public. These resources are invaluable for researchers, students, and scholars who need access to authentic and reliable information.

Thirdly, libraries play a vital role in promoting literacy and education. They offer free access to books, magazines, and other reading materials that people may not be able to afford otherwise. This is particularly important for children and young adults who need to develop their reading skills. Libraries also organize various events and programs that promote reading and learning, such as book clubs, author talks, and workshops.

Furthermore, libraries are an integral part of the community. They provide a safe and welcoming space for people to come together, share ideas, and learn from each other. Libraries often host community events, such as book fairs, cultural festivals, and art exhibitions, that promote social cohesion and diversity.

In conclusion, libraries are just as important in the digital age as they were before. They provide a unique environment that fosters learning, offers access to resources that are not available online, promotes literacy and education, and serves as a hub for community engagement. While the internet has certainly changed the way we access information, it cannot replace the invaluable role that libraries play in our society.

Firstly, when parents are constantly checking their child's grades and attendance, it can create a lot of stress for the student. The fear of disappointing their parents or not meeting their expectations can be overwhelming for some students. This can negatively impact their mental health and overall well-being.

Secondly, students deserve some level of privacy when it comes to their academic performance. If parents have access to their child's grades and attendance records at all times, it can feel like they are being constantly watched and evaluated. This can make students feel uncomfortable and may even discourage them from seeking help or support when they need it.

Lastly, there are potential security risks associated with online monitoring systems. If parents have access to their child's personal information, such as their grades and attendance records, it could be vulnerable to hacking or other forms of cyber attacks. This could put the student's privacy and safety at risk.

In conclusion, while it may seem like a good idea to allow parents to monitor their child's grades and attendance online, there are many potential drawbacks and risks associated with this practice.

First impressions are like, super important, right? Like, you know, when you meet someone new and they think you're cool or not. But, is it hard to change those impressions once they're made? Like, can you really turn someone's first impression of you around? I think so, but also not really. Here's why:

So, like, sometimes when you meet someone new, they might think you're really cool or funny or whatever, but then they get to know you better and they realize you're actually kind of lame or boring. That's when their first impression starts to change. But, it's not always easy to change those impressions. Like, if someone thinks you're a total weirdo at first, it might be hard to convince them that you're actually cool once they get to know you better.

On the other hand, sometimes you can totally change someone's first impression of you. Like, if you're really friendly and outgoing at first, and then you start acting all weird and shy, they might think you're even cooler because you're not just some boring person all the time. Or, like, if you do something really cool or brave, it can totally change their first impression of you. Like, if you save someone from a burning building or something, they're gonna think you're a total hero and want to be your friend forever! 😅

So, yeah, first impressions are important, but they're not always set in stone. You can totally change them if you want to, but it might take some effort and time.

Whether it's school, work, or extracurricular activities, it can be hard to find the time to do everything we want to do. However, I believe that we can accomplish more if we are doing something than if we remain idle.

Firstly, when we are actively engaged in a task, we are able to focus our energy and attention on that task. This allows us to put our best effort into it and achieve our goals more effectively. For example, when studying for an exam, it's much more productive to actively review the material and take notes than it is to simply read over the textbook. By actively engaging in the task, we are able to better understand and retain the information, leading to better grades on the exam.

Secondly, being active can help us to overcome procrastination. Procrastination can be a major obstacle to achieving our goals, as it often leads to wasted time and missed opportunities. By engaging in a task, we are able to make progress and see tangible results, which can motivate us to continue working towards our goals. For example, when working on a group project, it can be tempting to put off starting until the last minute. However, by actively engaging in the task and making progress early on, we can avoid the stress and pressure of rushing to complete the project before the deadline.

Finally, being active can also help us to improve our mental and physical health. When we are idle, we may become bored or restless, which can lead to negative emotions such as anxiety and depression. By engaging in a task, we are able to keep our minds and bodies active and healthy. For example, exercise has been shown to improve mood, reduce stress, and boost overall well-being.

In conclusion, I believe that we can accomplish more if we are doing something than if we remain idle. By actively engaging in a task, we are able to focus our energy and attention, overcome procrastination, and improve our mental and physical health.

When we are constantly surrounded by negativity and doubt, it can be difficult to stay motivated and on track. However, by tuning out the noise and focusing on our own thoughts and feelings, we can stay motivated and committed to achieving our goals.

Of course, it can be difficult to ignore the opinions and expectations of others, especially when they come from people we care about or respect. However, it is important to remember that ultimately, it is our own thoughts and feelings that guide us towards success. By staying true to ourselves and listening to our heart and mind, we can make decisions that lead to a fulfilling and successful life.

In conclusion, I believe that listening to your heart and mind is an important aspect of making decisions in life. It allows us to make decisions that are truly in line with our values and goals, and stay motivated and focused on our goals.

falcon_180b_v1_748,"I believe that allowing parents to monitor their children's grades and attendance online is a good practice. It can have several benefits for both the students and their parents.

Firstly, this policy allows parents to be more involved in their children's education. They can keep track of their child's progress and identify any areas where they may need additional support or help. For example, if a parent notices that their child's grades are slipping, they can reach out to the teacher to understand why and work together to find a solution.

Secondly, this policy promotes transparency and accountability. Students are more likely to take their studies seriously if they know that their parents are keeping an eye on their performance. This can motivate them to work harder and strive for better grades.

Lastly, this policy can help to identify any potential issues early on. For instance, if a student is frequently absent from school, their parents can address the issue with them and find out why they are not attending. This can help to prevent truancy and ensure that the student is receiving the education they need.

In conclusion, allowing parents to monitor their children's grades and attendance online is a positive practice. It promotes parental involvement, transparency, accountability, and can help to identify potential problems early on.",1,0.9945102,1,True
894C9DC473A0,"Imagination can be an incredibly powerful tool for achieving success. It enables us to go beyond our known boundaries and explore possibilities that we had not considered before. Imagination allows us to dream, devise plans, and think outside the box. In short, it gives us the confidence and motivation to try something new and make it happen.

Take the example of Elon Musk, who envisioned a world in which electric cars become the norm and space exploration was feasible for everyone. Through his imagination he was driven to build the electric car company Tesla and SpaceX. His successful vision was made possible by his ingenious imagination rather than sheer knowledge.

On the other hand, knowledge is important in the process of achieving success, however, without imagination, it is unlikely that this knowledge can be leveraged effectively. Knowledge without creativity and imagination is like driving a car without a destination. It's essential to understand the science behind what we are creating, but without creative ideas to guide us, all the knowledge in the world is useless.

In summary, imagination is just as important as knowledge when it comes to achieving success. It gives us the confidence and motivation to try something new, explore uncharted territory, and extend the boundaries of what is possible. Without imagination, knowledge alone cannot be leveraged effectively to manifest the desired dreams and ambitions.",1,0.9946668,1,True
E1DB041DD77B,"One of the most important factors in becoming successful in life is to have a positive attitude. Having an optimistic perspective allows us to discover opportunities we may have otherwise overlooked and provides us with the courage to take risks and push through difficult times. We may also find that a positive outlook brings more happiness and respect, not just from those around us, but also from ourselves. 

A great example of how positivity impacts our success is that of setting goals. A positive attitude allows us to focus on our goals, look at every setback as an opportunity for growth, and be truly passionate about what we are striving for. This makes us more motivated, creative, and confident, which in turn gives us the necessary tools to reach our desired destination.

On the other hand, having a negative attitude puts us in an energy-draining downward spiral where we focus on failures and obstacles rather than proactive solutions. This can not only limit us from accomplishing our goals but also lead us to lose sight of our hopes, dreams, and aspirations.

Therefore, having a positive attitude is essential to achieving happiness, respect, and success in life. It can open doors to new beginnings, help us stay resilient amidst hardships, and give us the energy to overcome any challenge. When we choose positively, we begin to see the world through a lens of endless possibilities—one that can help us to experience true fulfillment within our lives.",1,0.994521,1,True
E3DF63035440,"Winston Churchill famously said that ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts."" This is a profound statement that speaks to the importance of not letting failure stand in the way of achieving your ultimate success. Failure is a natural part of life; no one accomplishes their goals with initial success alone. It is by learning from our mistakes that we can become better and progress towards success. 

In particular, it is the courage to persist through the failures that will ultimately drive lasting success. Churchill serves as a powerful example of this idea, as his tenacity through his failures enabled him to ultimately become one of the greatest statesmen in history. He was able to persist through difficult times of failure and ultimately achieved great success because of his determination and courage to continue. 

In short, failures do not necessarily indicate a lack of success; rather, they should be viewed as an important stepping stone on the way to success. Through the courage to not give up in the face of failures, success can be achieved.",1,0.9945886,1,True

Collaboration typically involved two or more individuals or groups working together to obtain a desired outcome from a project. The collaborative approach allowed for different perspectives and ideas to be combined to create more effective solutions. 

For example, when creating a new infrastructure project within the Roman Empire, it was not uncommon for a variety of experts to be consulted. The multi-faceted approach, which included individuals with different expertise, allowed for all angles to be identified and addressed to ensure the end result was a project that was feasible and beneficial to the Empire. Similarly, in the Islamic Empire, collaboration was seen as an important part of the decision-making process and ideas were welcomed from different stakeholders for input.

Combining different ideas and perspectives when seeking advice or trying to solve a problem is a key advantage of collaboration. By gathering input from multiple people, there is greater potential for a better solution to be identified and for the efficiency of the project to be improved.

Through talking with the counselor, I was able to identify unhealthy patterns of thinking that were holding me back. With the help of the counselor's guidance, I was able to let go of many of these patterns and move forward with more confidence.

falcon_180b_v1_220,"As a Grade 10 student, I firmly believe that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Distance learning, which includes options like online classes and video conferencing, allows students to have more flexibility and control over their own schedules. This can be a real boon for those who may have personal or family responsibilities that can get in the way of traditional in-person classes.

For instance, a student who is also taking care of a younger sibling or a sick parent would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. They may not be able to make it to school on time or at all if they have to be home to take care of their family. But if they can attend classes online or through video conferencing, they would be able to complete their schoolwork without sacrificing their family obligations.

In addition, distance learning can be a great way for students to learn at their own pace. For example, if a student is struggling with a particular concept, they can pause a video lecture and review it until they fully understand it. They don't have to worry about falling behind the rest of the class or feeling embarrassed to ask for help.

Furthermore, distance learning can also be more efficient. With online or video classes, there is often less time spent on things like taking attendance, settling into seats, or packing up and leaving. This means that more time can be dedicated to actual instruction and learning.

Of course, there are some potential drawbacks to distance learning. For example, students may miss out on the social aspects of being in a physical classroom. They may also be more prone to distractions or procrastination when they are at home. However, I think these challenges can be overcome with the right support and strategies.

Overall, I believe that the benefits of distance learning outweigh the potential drawbacks. By giving students more flexibility, control, and efficiency, distance learning can help them to achieve their academic goals while also balancing other responsibilities and obligations.",1,0.9943171,1,True

First of all, people ask for advice because they need help. Maybe they're going through a tough time or they're trying to make a big decision. And when they ask for advice, they're basically saying, ""Hey, I need someone to talk to. I need someone to help me figure this out."" And that's where you come in! 

Giving advice can be really rewarding, you know? Like, when you help someone figure out a problem or make a decision, it's like, you're making a difference in their life.

llama_70b_v11082,"Standardized testing has been a controversial topic in education for a long time. While some people argue that it is an effective way to measure student ability, others claim that it is an inaccurate and unfair method. In my opinion, standardized tests are not a true reflection of a student's ability.

Firstly, standardized tests are often biased towards certain groups of students. For instance, students from low-income families may not have access to the same resources and opportunities as their peers from wealthier backgrounds. This means that they may not perform as well on the test, not because they are less intelligent, but because they have not had the same chance to prepare. Additionally, students who are English language learners may struggle with the language barrier, which can hinder their performance on the test. This is not a reflection of their intelligence or abilities, but rather a result of their circumstances.

Secondly, standardized tests only measure a narrow range of skills. They typically focus on multiple-choice questions that assess memory and basic comprehension, but do not take into account important skills such as critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving. Students who excel in these areas may not perform well on the test, even though they have valuable skills that are essential for success in the real world.

Furthermore, standardized tests put a lot of pressure on students. The high stakes associated with these tests can cause students to feel anxious and stressed, which can negatively impact their performance. This is particularly true for students who already struggle with test anxiety or have mental health issues. The pressure to perform well can be overwhelming, and it is not a healthy or productive way to assess student ability.

Finally, there are better ways to assess student ability. Alternative assessment methods, such as project-based learning and portfolios, provide a more comprehensive picture of a student's abilities. These methods allow students to demonstrate their skills and knowledge in a more meaningful way, and they are often more engaging and motivating for students.

In conclusion, standardized tests are not an accurate measure of student ability. They are biased, narrow, and put a lot of pressure on students. Instead, we should focus on alternative assessment methods that provide a more holistic view of student ability and encourage students to develop important skills such as critical thinking and creativity. By doing so, we can create a more equitable and effective education system that truly supports the success of all students.",1,0.9941981,1,True

Year-round schooling has been a topic of discussion for a while now, and I think it's important to weigh the pros and cons of this system. On one hand, attending school year-round can provide students with a more consistent learning environment and allow for better time management. For instance, students can take breaks during the summer months without falling behind in their studies. This can be especially helpful for students who have a hard time staying motivated during the summer when they're not in school.

Another advantage of year-round schooling is that it can help reduce the summer slide. This is when students lose some of the knowledge and skills they learned during the previous school year over the summer break. By attending school year-round, students can continue to learn and reinforce their knowledge without falling behind.

However, there are also some disadvantages to year-round schooling. One of the main drawbacks is that it can be stressful for students and their families. Having to attend school for longer periods of time can lead to burnout and fatigue, which can negatively impact students' academic performance. Additionally, some students may have conflicts with their extracurricular activities or summer jobs, which can make it difficult to balance school and other responsibilities.

Another disadvantage of year-round schooling is that it can be expensive. Building and maintaining schools year-round can be costly, and this expense may be passed on to taxpayers. This can be a significant concern for families who may struggle to afford the added cost of year-round schooling.

In conclusion, while there are some advantages to year-round schooling, such as a more consistent learning environment and reduced summer slide, there are also some disadvantages, including increased stress and expense. Ultimately, the decision to implement year-round schooling should be based on the specific needs and circumstances of each school district.

When we fail, we are forced to examine what went wrong and try to figure out how to improve in the future. This process of reflection can help us avoid making the same mistakes again and increase our chances of success.

With her help, I was able to improve my grades and gain a better understanding of math.

Another example of the importance of failure comes from my friend's experience starting a business. He had a great idea for a product, but when he tried to launch it, it didn't gain much traction. Instead of giving up, he took the time to reflect on what went wrong and came up with a new plan. He was able to pivot his business and eventually find success.

In addition to teaching us valuable lessons, failure can also help us build resilience. When we fail, we are forced to push through difficult times and keep going. This can help us develop the mental toughness and perseverance needed to overcome obstacles and achieve success.

And it's not just for fun! Technology can also help people communicate in emergency situations!  Like, if someone is in a car accident or has a medical emergency, they can just call 911 on their phone!  It's like, instant help!  They can even send pictures or videos of what's happening to show the emergency responders! 

For example, my cousin was on a camping trip and got lost in the woods. She called 911 on her phone, and they were able to find her super fast!  She was so grateful that she could call for help so easily! 

Another example is when my friend's grandma had a heart attack. She called 911 on her phone, and the ambulance got there super fast!  She was saved! 

So, in conclusion, technology is super cool and helps people communicate with each other and get help in emergency situations!  It's like, the best thing ever!

f42b35f4,"In recent years, there has been a growing trend in limiting car usage in various cities around the world. This movement, known as ""smart planning,"" aims to separate suburban life from auto use in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote alternative forms of transportation. The advantages of limiting car usage are evident in the experiences of communities like Vauban in Germany, Paris in France, and Bogota in Colombia.

Vauban, an experimental community in Germany, has implemented strict regulations on car ownership and parking. While car ownership is allowed, residents are only permitted to park in large garages at the edge of the development. As a result, 70 percent of families in Vauban do not own cars, and 57 percent sold their cars to move there. The absence of cars has created a peaceful and serene environment, with streets filled only with bicycles and pedestrians. This has significantly reduced greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes, as automobiles are responsible for 12 percent of emissions in Europe.

Similarly, Paris has enforced driving bans during periods of intense smog to reduce pollution levels. In these instances, only cars with even- or odd-numbered license plates were allowed on the roads, with violators facing fines. This partial driving ban resulted in a 60 percent decrease in congestion in the city. The high turnout and success of these restrictions demonstrate that limiting car usage can have a positive impact on air quality and public health.

In Bogota, Colombia, millions of residents participate in a car-free day each year. Cars are completely banned on this day, with only buses and taxis permitted. The goal of this event is to promote alternative forms of transportation and reduce smog. The success of this program has led to the expansion of car-free days to other cities in Colombia. Municipal authorities from other countries have also come to Bogota to observe and learn from this revolutionary movement.

Limiting car usage has several benefits for the environment and society as a whole. The reduction in car ownership and driving has the potential to significantly decrease carbon emissions, making a positive impact on global climate change. Additionally, car-free communities can reduce congestion and improve air quality, leading to healthier and more sustainable cities. The shift towards alternative forms of transportation, such as walking, biking, and public transit, can also bring a sense of community and connectedness among residents.

While the cultural shift away from car dependency may have implications for the car industry, it presents significant opportunities for urban planning and the development of innovative transportation solutions. The trend of limiting car usage is not limited to developed countries; it is also observed in the developing world, where burgeoning middle-class populations are contributing to increased air pollution in cities. Governments and organizations around the world are starting to recognize the importance of limiting car usage and promoting sustainable transportation options. Through these efforts, we can create more livable, environmentally-friendly, and efficient cities for future generations.",1,0.99161184,1,True

falcon_180b_v1_650,"""With the rise of social media, there has been an increase in the amount of personal information shared online."" This statement is undoubtedly true. Social media has become a ubiquitous aspect of modern life, and the vast majority of people now share personal information on these platforms without a second thought. However, the question of whether or not stronger privacy protections are needed on social media remains a contentious issue.

On one hand, it can be argued that stronger privacy protections are essential to protect individuals from the negative consequences of oversharing. When people share personal information online, they are often unaware of the potential repercussions. For example, a seemingly innocuous post about one's location could be used by criminals to determine when a person's home will be empty. Similarly, sharing too much information about one's personal life could lead to embarrassment or even job loss if the wrong person sees it.

Furthermore, many social media companies have been criticized for their lax privacy policies. These companies often collect vast amounts of data on their users, including their browsing history, location, and even private messages. This data can then be used for targeted advertising or sold to third-party companies without the user's knowledge or consent. Stronger privacy protections would ensure that these companies are held accountable for their actions and that users have more control over their data.

On the other hand, some argue that individuals should be responsible for managing their own privacy on social media. After all, these platforms are voluntary, and users are not forced to share personal information. If someone is concerned about their privacy, they can simply choose not to use social media at all or limit the amount of information they share. Additionally, social media companies argue that they need access to user data to provide a better user experience and that stronger privacy protections could stifle innovation.

In conclusion, while there are certainly arguments on both sides of this issue, I believe that stronger privacy protections are needed on social media. The potential consequences of oversharing personal information are simply too great to ignore, and social media companies have not shown that they can be trusted to protect their users' data. By implementing stronger privacy protections, we can ensure that individuals are able to use social media safely and without fear of negative consequences.""",1,0.9946109,1,True
falcon_180b_v1_653,"Dear Principal,

I am writing to express my opinion on the proposed policy change that would require students to have at least a grade B average to participate in sports or other activities. While I understand the importance of academic success, I believe that this policy would have negative consequences for many students.

Firstly, not all students excel academically, and some may struggle to maintain a grade B average. These students may find motivation in participating in sports or other activities, which could help them improve their grades. By denying them the opportunity to participate, we may be taking away a valuable source of inspiration and support.

Additionally, participation in sports and other activities can teach students valuable skills such as teamwork, leadership, and time management. These skills can be applied to academic success and are essential for success in the real world.

Furthermore, sports and other activities provide a healthy outlet for students to release stress and stay physically active. By denying them this opportunity, we may be contributing to a sedentary lifestyle and poor mental health.

While I understand the need for academic success, I believe that this policy would do more harm than good. Instead, we should focus on providing support for students who may be struggling academically, rather than punishing them by denying them the opportunity to participate in activities.

Thank you for considering my opinion.

034cbca1,"Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my opinion regarding the Electoral College and its role in electing the President of the United States. After carefully considering the information provided in various texts, I firmly believe that the Electoral College should be kept in place rather than switching to a popular vote system. 

One of the main reasons for maintaining the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome it provides. As stated in Judge Richard A. Posner's article, a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The winning candidate's share of the Electoral College typically exceeds their share of the popular vote, ensuring a clear and decisive outcome. This reduces the chances of extended legal battles and potential chaos that could arise from a close popular vote result. 

Another important aspect of the Electoral College is its ability to ensure that each region of the country is represented and heard. As noted by Judge Posner, no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. Therefore, candidates must have trans-regional appeal and consider the interests of voters from different parts of the country. This helps prevent a candidate with limited regional appeal from being elected and promotes the idea that the president should represent the entire nation.

The Electoral College also incentivizes candidates to focus on swing states, as discussed by Judge Posner. These states are crucial in deciding the outcome of the election and receive heightened attention from candidates during campaigns. This ensures that voters in swing states have a greater opportunity to engage with the candidates and make informed decisions. 

Furthermore, the Electoral College balances the influence of big and small states. Large states, by population, have an advantage in the political balance due to their higher number of electoral votes. This helps to counterbalance the mal-apportionment of the Senate, as explained by Judge Posner. By giving more weight to large states, the Electoral College ensures that candidates pay attention to their concerns and issues.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for runoff elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, the Electoral College produces a clear winner. This eliminates the need for additional voting rounds and simplifies the presidential election process.

While some argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters who have no hope of carrying their state, the information provided in these texts suggests that voters participate in presidential elections to express their political preferences rather than with the expectation that their individual vote will decide the outcome. 

In conclusion, the Electoral College serves an important role in our presidential elections. It provides certainty of outcome, ensures regional representation, promotes attention to swing states, balances the influence of different-sized states, and avoids the need for runoff elections. These reasons, along with the arguments presented in the texts, support the case for keeping the Electoral College. I urge you to consider these factors when evaluating any proposals for change.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

B4CBDAF1161C,"Art, music, and drama classes are essential components of a well-rounded education. They provide students with an opportunity to express themselves creatively, develop their skills, and contribute to the culture of their nation. In this essay, I will argue that making these classes mandatory in schools is crucial for the development of the next generation of artists, musicians, and actors.

Firstly, competition is an essential aspect of any artistic endeavor. It is through competition that artists, musicians, and actors are able to push themselves to their limits and achieve greatness. Research has shown that competition can have a positive impact on students. A study conducted by the National Endowment for the Arts found that students who participated in arts and cultural programs were more likely to excel academically and have higher levels of self-esteem (Ruppert, 2016). By making art, music, and drama classes mandatory in schools, we can provide students with the opportunity to compete and develop their skills in these areas.

Secondly, music is an essential part of a nation's culture. It is through music that we are able to connect with our past and understand our identity. For example, the music of Ireland, known as Irish traditional music, is an essential part of Irish culture. It is a unique blend of instruments, such as the fiddle, tin whistle, and uilleann pipes, and it is characterized by its lively, upbeat tempo. This music has been passed down from generation to generation and is an important part of Irish heritage. By making music classes mandatory in schools, we can ensure that students are exposed to the music of their nation and are able to appreciate its cultural significance.

Finally, many successful artists, musicians, and actors have started out in school. For example, J.K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter series, attended art school before becoming a writer. Similarly, Beyoncé, the world-renowned singer and actress, began her career in school. By providing students with the opportunity to develop their skills in art, music, and drama, we can help to cultivate the next generation of successful artists, musicians, and actors.

Driverless cars are a new technology that is being developed and tested. They are cars that do not require a driver to operate them, as they are equipped with sensors, cameras, and other advanced technologies that allow them to navigate the roads on their own. While some people are excited about the potential of driverless cars, others are concerned about the risks and negative consequences that they may bring. In this essay, I will argue against the development of driverless cars.

Body:

One of the main concerns about driverless cars is safety. While proponents of the technology argue that it will reduce accidents caused by human error, there is still a risk that the cars could malfunction or make mistakes that could lead to accidents. In the article ""Driverless Cars are Coming,"" the author mentions a recent accident involving a driverless car that resulted in a fatality. This shows that even with advanced technology, there is still a risk of accidents and fatalities.

Another concern is the potential loss of jobs. If driverless cars become the norm, it could lead to the loss of jobs for millions of people who work as drivers, such as taxi and truck drivers. While some argue that new jobs will be created to replace these jobs, it is uncertain whether these new jobs will be enough to offset the loss of jobs caused by the technology.

Finally, there is the issue of cost. Driverless cars are likely to be expensive, which means that they will only be accessible to a small percentage of the population. This could exacerbate existing inequalities and make it even harder for low-income people to access transportation.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, while driverless cars may seem like an exciting new technology, there are many concerns that need to be addressed before they can be safely and responsibly introduced. The risks of accidents, job loss, and inequality are too great to ignore. Therefore, I believe that we should not continue to develop driverless cars until these concerns have been addressed and resolved.",1,0.9933294,1,True
E3097287CBD1,"Sure, I'll give it a try! Here's my essay on the advantages and disadvantages of traditional in-person educational instruction versus distance learning instruction:

As an 8th grader, I've had the opportunity to experience both traditional in-person educational instruction and distance learning. While both methods have their pros and cons, I believe that in-person instruction is more beneficial for students.

One of the main advantages of in-person instruction is the ability to interact with teachers and peers face-to-face. This allows for better communication and collaboration, which are essential for learning. In a classroom setting, students can ask questions, participate in discussions, and work together on projects. This face-to-face interaction helps to build relationships and create a sense of community, which can lead to better learning outcomes.

Another advantage of in-person instruction is the ability to get immediate feedback from teachers. When students are working on a project or assignment, they can ask for help and get immediate feedback from their teachers. This helps to identify any mistakes or areas where they need to improve, which can lead to better grades and better learning.

On the other hand, distance learning has its own set of advantages. One of the biggest advantages is the flexibility it offers. Students can complete coursework on their own time and at their own pace, which can be especially helpful for those who have busy schedules or who live in remote areas. This flexibility can also help students who may need to take breaks or who have difficulty with traditional classroom instruction.

However, distance learning also has its own set of disadvantages. One of the main disadvantages is the lack of face-to-face interaction. Without the ability to interact with teachers and peers, students may feel isolated or disconnected from their learning. This can lead to a lack of motivation or engagement, which can negatively impact their learning outcomes.

Another disadvantage of distance learning is the potential for technical issues. When students are relying on technology to access course materials and complete assignments, technical issues can arise. This can include problems with connectivity, compatibility, or software glitches, which can be frustrating and time-consuming to resolve.

Working Alone vs. Working in a Group: Which is Better?

As an 8th grader, I've had my fair share of both individual and group projects. While working with others can be fun and exciting, I believe that working alone has more benefits than working in a group.

First of all, when you work alone, you can focus better on the task at hand. There are fewer distractions and interruptions when you're working by yourself, which means you can get more done in less time. For example, when I'm working on a science project, I can concentrate on the experiment without having to worry about what my group members are doing. This helps me to think more clearly and come up with better ideas.

Another benefit of working alone is that you can learn more about the topic. When you're working in a group, you might not have as much time to research and learn about the topic as you would if you were working alone. But when you're working alone, you can take your time to read and learn as much as you want, which can help you to understand the topic better. For instance, when I was working on a history project, I was able to spend more time reading about the topic and learning new things, which helped me to get a better grade.

Working alone can also lead to more creativity. When you're working with others, you might feel like you have to conform to their ideas and opinions. But when you're working alone, you can let your imagination run wild and come up with unique and innovative ideas. For example, when I was working on a writing project, I was able to come up with a story that was completely different from what my group members had come up with, and it turned out to be one of the best parts of the project.

Finally, working alone can help you to develop your time management skills. When you're working with others, it can be easy to get distracted and fall behind schedule. But when you're working alone, you have to be more responsible and manage your time better. For instance, when I was working on a math project, I had to make sure I finished my part on time, which helped me",1,0.9944899,1,True

Arts education provides many benefits to students, such as improving creativity, critical thinking, and communication skills. It also allows students to express themselves and develop their own unique talents.

One of the most important benefits of arts education is that it helps to improve creativity. When students are exposed to different forms of art, such as painting, music, or theater, they are encouraged to think outside of the box and come up with new and innovative ideas. This type of thinking is essential in many different areas of life, from problem-solving in the workplace to coming up with new inventions.

Another benefit of arts education is that it helps to develop critical thinking skills. When students are analyzing and interpreting works of art, they are learning to think critically and to look at things from different perspectives. This type of thinking is essential in many different areas of life, from analyzing data in a scientific experiment to evaluating arguments in a debate.

Finally, arts education helps to improve communication skills. When students are working on a project in the arts, they are often required to communicate their ideas and collaborate with others.

It not only reflects an individual's personal values and character, but also impacts the surrounding community in powerful ways. By setting a good example, we can inspire those around us to become better versions of themselves through a combination of admiration and emulation. We can also create a positive environment in which people feel inspired and supported to pursue and strive for success.

When individuals lead by setting a good example, their positive behaviors are bound to rub off on those they interact with, especially those in their immediate network.

On one hand, adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet can have several benefits. For example, it can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental problems associated with meat production. It can also improve our health by reducing the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and other health problems.

Moreover, there are plenty of delicious vegetarian and vegan foods to choose from, such as fruits, vegetables, grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds. These foods are rich in nutrients, fiber, and antioxidants that can help keep us healthy and energized.

On the other hand, it can be challenging to give up meat completely, especially for those who are used to eating it regularly. Meat provides important nutrients such as protein, iron, and B vitamins that are essential for our growth and development. It can also be a source of cultural and social identity for some people.

Moreover, some vegetarian or vegan diets may not provide enough of certain nutrients, such as vitamin B12, zinc, and calcium, which are typically found in animal products. This can lead to deficiencies and health problems if not properly managed.

In conclusion, while there are pros and cons to adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet, I believe that it is worth considering, especially if you are concerned about the environment and your health.

For example, I have a friend who plays sports and is really good at it. But he also helps his family with their business and doesn't have much free time. If the principal makes him join an extracurricular activity like the student council, he won't have time to do his sports and help his family.

Additionally, learning how to goalkeep can help you become a valuable asset to your team.

Thirdly, challenging yourself to compete for opportunities such as being chosen for an international team can help you push yourself to become a better soccer player. Competing against other players can help you develop your skills and improve your overall performance. Additionally, being chosen for an international team can be a great accomplishment and can help you gain exposure to other soccer players and coaches.

Fourthly, it's important to understand that success is not easily achieved and involves facing difficulties and working hard. Becoming a skilled soccer player takes time and dedication. It requires hard work and practice, and there will be times when you will face difficulties and setbacks. However, it's important to keep pushing through these difficulties and continue to work hard to achieve your goals.

Lastly, reflecting on life experience and learning from mistakes, along with hard work, can lead to success in soccer. As an 8th-grade student, I have learned that making mistakes is a natural part of the learning process. However, it's important to learn from these mistakes and continue to work hard to improve. Additionally, reflecting on life experience can help you gain valuable insights into what works and what doesn't, which can help you improve your soccer skills.

As an 8th grader, I know that getting into and graduating from college is a big deal. It's like, super important. So, I've been doing some research and here are the steps I found out:

First, you gotta get good grades. Like, really good grades. You know, like A's and B's. And you gotta take hard classes, like AP classes. That way, when you apply to college, you'll have a bunch of good grades and they'll be like, ""Wow, this kid is smart!""

Next, you gotta take the SAT or ACT. That's like, a big test that shows how smart you are. And you gotta do well on it. Like, really well. If you don't do well, you might not get into college. So, you should probably study for it.

After that, you gotta apply to college. You gotta write a bunch of essays and stuff, and you gotta send in your transcript and stuff. It's a lot of work, but it's worth it in the end.

But, here's the thing: school isn't the only thing that's important. You also gotta have a schedule. Like, you gotta know when you're gonna study, when you're gonna do homework, when you're gonna practice soccer, and when you're gonna hang out with your friends. It's like, really important to have a schedule so you don't forget stuff.

It is true that having an optimistic outlook has a range of benefits – it can make it easier to accomplish goals and build relationships – but there are also times when maintaining a neutral, or even negative, attitude is more relevant.

Going in with an overly-positive mindset can be counterproductive, as it may lead to unrealistic expectations and a frustrating lack of progress. With this situation, an individual may be too eager to believe that any obstacles can be easily overcome, when in reality additional challenges may be encountered. On the other hand, adopting a more practical and measured approach, one that does not involve ignoring potential roadblocks or issues, can allow an individual to remain calm and remain focused on their goal.

Having a negative attitude can also be damaging, as it is easy to become overwhelmed and disheartened. A pessimistic attitude is unlikely to lead to fruitful endeavors, as it can prevent an individual from taking risks or challenging themselves in worthwhile ways. Additionally, a pessimistic outlook can also tarnish relationships, making it difficult to form meaningful connections with those around you.

Ultimately, having the right balance between optimism and pessimism is key to finding success in life. It is important to recognize the potential risks and difficulties, but also have an underlying positive outlook which encourages progress.

llama_70b_v1823,"I believe that the development of driverless cars is a positive step towards a more efficient and safe future. According to the article, driverless cars have the potential to save thousands of lives by reducing the number of accidents caused by human error. For instance, in 2015, there were 35,000 fatal car crashes in the United States, and 94% of them were caused by human mistakes. By taking human drivers out of the equation, driverless cars can significantly decrease the number of accidents and save countless lives.

Moreover, driverless cars will also increase mobility for the elderly and people with disabilities. The article states that currently, many elderly people have to rely on others for transportation, which can be inconvenient and restrictive. With driverless cars, they will have the freedom to travel independently, which will greatly improve their quality of life. Similarly, people with disabilities will have greater mobility and independence, as driverless cars can be designed to accommodate their needs.

Furthermore, driverless cars will also revolutionize the way we travel. According to the article, driverless cars can travel in packs, or “platoons,” which will reduce traffic congestion and increase the speed of travel. Additionally, driverless cars will allow passengers to use their time more productively during their commute, as they will be able to work, read, or relax instead of focusing on driving.

However, some people may argue that driverless cars are not safe and that they will take away jobs from human drivers. The article acknowledges these concerns and states that driverless cars are not yet perfect and may still be involved in accidents. Nevertheless, the technology is rapidly improving, and manufacturers are working hard to ensure that driverless cars are safe and reliable. As for the concern about job loss, it is true that driverless cars may replace some human drivers, but they will also create new job opportunities in fields such as programming, maintenance, and repair.

In conclusion, the development of driverless cars is a positive step towards a more efficient, safe, and convenient future. The benefits of driverless cars, such as reducing accidents, increasing mobility for the elderly and people with disabilities, and revolutionizing the way we travel, outweigh the concerns about safety and job loss. As technology continues to advance, I believe that driverless cars will become an integral part of our lives and greatly improve our quality of life.",1,0.9940686,1,True

Subject: Keeping the Electoral College for the Presidential Election

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to you today as a concerned citizen of this great nation to express my support for keeping the Electoral College for the election of the President of the United States. While there are arguments in favor of changing to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College offers several practical advantages that make it a preferable method of electing our nation's leader.

First and foremost, the Electoral College provides a certainty of outcome. As stated by Judge Richard A. Posner in his article ""In Defense of the Electoral College,"" the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College consistently exceeds their share of the popular vote. This ensures that the president is elected with a clear majority of electoral votes, reducing the likelihood of contentious disputes over the results. In an election system solely based on the popular vote, these disputes could occur more frequently due to closer margins.

Additionally, the Electoral College fosters the concept of ""everyone's president."" Under this system, a presidential candidate must have trans-regional appeal, as no single region has enough electoral votes to secure the presidency. Candidates must campaign in a broader range of states, promoting national unity and understanding. This prevents a situation where a candidate with only regional support becomes the president, which could lead to a sense of disenfranchisement among residents of other regions.

Furthermore, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes, as mentioned by Judge Posner, encourages candidates to focus their campaigns on swing states. By doing so, they are more likely to engage with voters directly, ensuring that these voters are well-informed and thoughtful in making their decisions. This emphasis on swing states promotes a more informed electorate, as they receive more attention and information from the candidates compared to voters in non-competitive states.

The Electoral College also offers a balance of power by giving larger states a greater influence, albeit indirectly. While some may argue that this is unfair, it is crucial to remember that the Electoral College partially compensates for the mal-apportionment of the Senate as dictated by the Constitution. By providing each state with a minimum of three electoral votes, regardless of population size, smaller states still maintain a voice in the election process. This balance ensures that candidates must consider the concerns and interests of both large and small states.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, the Electoral College ensures that a clear winner emerges. This avoids the complications and potential divisions that may arise from extended election processes. Precluding the necessity of run-off elections streamlines our electoral system, allowing for a prompt and decisive outcome.

In conclusion, the Electoral College may not be a perfect system, but its practical advantages make it a better choice for electing our president than a popular vote. It offers a certainty of outcome, encourages candidates to appeal to a wider range of voters, provides a balance of power among states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While understanding the concerns against the Electoral College, I firmly believe that the benefits it offers outweigh any argument for change.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this important matter. I trust that you will weigh the advantages and disadvantages carefully before making any decisions that could affect our electoral process. I trust in your wisdom and judgment to make the best choice for our great state and country.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1,0.9898712,1,True

One of the most significant benefits of working in a group is time management. When working alone, it can be challenging to manage time effectively. There are no deadlines or accountability, which can lead to procrastination and poor time management. On the other hand, when working in a group, there are deadlines and accountability. This means that group members are more likely to stay on track and manage their time effectively.

Another benefit of working in a group is gaining new information. When working alone, it can be challenging to gain new information. There are no different perspectives or ideas to consider. However, when working in a group, there are different perspectives and ideas to consider. This can lead to a more well-rounded understanding of the topic and a more creative solution to the problem.

Faster work is another benefit of working in a group. When working alone, it can take longer to complete a task. This is because there is no one to bounce ideas off of or to help with the task. However, when working in a group, there are more people to bounce ideas off of and to help with the task. This can lead to faster work and a more efficient solution to the problem.

It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" This quote emphasizes the importance of staying active and avoiding idleness in order to achieve great things.

As an eighth-grader, I understand the importance of staying active and not being bored. There are many ways to stay active, such as participating in sports, joining a club or team, or even volunteering in the community. These activities not only keep us physically active, but also mentally stimulated and engaged.

In addition to staying active, going to the gym has numerous benefits for both physical and mental health. Exercise helps to improve cardiovascular health, build muscle and bone strength, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. Furthermore, going to the gym can also improve mood and reduce stress levels.

Another great way to stay active is by going for walks. Walking is a low-impact exercise that can be done anywhere, at any time. It is a great way to get some fresh air, clear the mind, and enjoy the natural surroundings. Walking has also been shown to improve cardiovascular health and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.

Finally, getting a job can also be a great way to stay active and engaged. Working provides a sense of purpose and accomplishment, as well as the opportunity to learn new skills and meet new people. It can also provide a source of income, which can be used to pursue other interests and activities.

CA42D47C0914,"Being yourself is an important aspect of life that is often overlooked. It is easy to get caught up in the desire to fit in and be accepted by others, but this can lead to a loss of individuality and authenticity. In this essay, I will discuss the importance of being yourself and provide an example from personal experience.

One of the reasons why it is important to be yourself is that it allows you to express your true thoughts and feelings. When you try to act like someone you are not, you are hiding your true self and suppressing your individuality. This can lead to feelings of frustration and unhappiness, as you are not able to fully express yourself.

For example, when I was in middle school, I struggled with fitting in and making friends. I often felt like I had to act a certain way in order to be accepted by my peers. However, I soon realized that this was not sustainable and that I was not able to be myself. I began to embrace my true self and started to make friends based on my interests and passions, rather than trying to fit in with the popular crowd. This allowed me to express myself fully and feel more authentic in my interactions with others.

Another reason why it is important to be yourself is that it allows you to build meaningful relationships. When you are trying to act like someone you are not, you are not able to form genuine connections with others. This is because you are not able to fully express yourself and build trust with others.

For example, when I was in high school, I had a friend who always tried to act like someone else in order to fit in. However, this made it difficult for us to have meaningful conversations and build a strong friendship. We were not able to fully express ourselves and understand each other, which led to a lack of depth in our relationship. Eventually, we drifted apart because we were not able to build a strong foundation based on authenticity.

In conclusion, being yourself is an important aspect of life that allows you to express your true thoughts and feelings, build meaningful relationships, and feel more authentic in your interactions with others. It is easy to get caught up in the desire to fit in and be accepted by others, but this can lead to a loss of individuality and authenticity.

It can also be seen to help foster creativity and impart interpersonal skills that can prove beneficial both inside and outside the classroom setting.

On the other hand, many view these mandatory classes as more of a nuisance than a boon for students, as they can be seen as detracting from the more significant courses and studies necessary to prepare students for college.

llama_70b_v1593,"Summer projects are a great way for students to keep their minds active during the break. But the question is, should these projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? In my opinion, summer projects should be student-designed.

Firstly, when students design their own projects, they are more likely to be motivated and interested in the topic. They will have the freedom to choose a topic that they are passionate about, and this will make them more engaged in the learning process. For example, if a student is interested in photography, they could design a project where they take pictures of different landscapes and edit them using various software. This will not only help them improve their photography skills but also learn how to use different software.

Secondly, student-designed projects allow students to develop their critical thinking and problem-solving skills. When students are given a project that is already designed by a teacher, they are limited to the scope of the project. But when they design their own projects, they have to think critically and come up with their own ideas, which will help them develop their problem-solving skills. For instance, a student who is interested in science could design a project where they conduct experiments to find out the effect of pH on plant growth. This will require them to think critically and come up with their own methods and hypotheses.

Furthermore, student-designed projects can be tailored to the individual needs and interests of each student. Every student is unique and has their own strengths and weaknesses. By allowing students to design their own projects, teachers can cater to the individual needs of each student. For example, a student who struggles with writing could design a project where they create a video script and record a video, instead of writing a research paper.

On the other hand, teacher-designed projects can be beneficial in some ways. Teachers have more experience and knowledge in their subject areas, so they can design projects that are more challenging and rigorous. Teacher-designed projects can also ensure that students are learning specific skills and knowledge that are required for their grade level. For instance, a teacher-designed project could require students to research a specific historical event and create a presentation, which will help them learn about that event and develop their research and presentation skills.

In conclusion, while teacher-designed projects have their benefits, I believe that student-designed projects are more effective in promoting learning and development. By allowing students to design their own projects, they will be more motivated, develop their critical thinking and problem-solving skills, and have the opportunity to tailor their projects to their individual needs and interests. So, schools should consider implementing student-designed summer projects to ensure that students continue learning during their break.",1,0.9864672,1,True

Subject: The Importance of Maintaining the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College and urge you to consider the many benefits of maintaining this system for electing the President of the United States. While some argue for a shift to a direct popular vote, I believe that the Electoral College serves an essential role in our democracy, balancing the interests of both smaller and larger states, promoting regional representation, and ensuring a stable and fair election process.

To begin, it is crucial to understand the purpose of the Electoral College. The founding fathers established this system as a compromise between electing the President through Congress and a popular vote. As stated by the Office of the Federal Register, the Electoral College process consists of the selection of electors, their voting for the President and Vice President, and the counting of electoral votes by Congress. This process ensures that each state's allotment of electors is based on the number of its Congressional delegation, thus providing representation for both the House of Representatives and the Senate.

One of the primary advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome it offers. In a dispute over election results, the electoral vote winner typically receives a larger share than their popular vote counterpart. This avoids lengthy legal battles and provides a clear winner without causing further division among the American people.

Furthermore, the Electoral College promotes the notion that the President of the United States should be everyone's President. Since no single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, candidates must gain trans-regional appeal. This encourages candidates to campaign in different states and address the concerns of a diverse range of citizens. By doing so, the Electoral College ensures that the President represents the interests of all regions of the country, preventing regional favoritism and fostering national unity.

Another significant advantage of the Electoral College is its impact on swing states. The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on these states. This not only leads to increased voter engagement, but it also ensures that voters in swing states have a more significant influence in deciding the election. This system encourages both candidates and voters to participate actively in the democratic process, providing a fair and inclusive representation of the electorate's preferences.

The Electoral College also plays a crucial role in balancing the interests of large and small states. According to Judge Richard A. Posner, the Electoral College restores some weight to the political influence of large states, compensating for the mal-apportionment of the Senate. While the popular vote might be close in a large state such as Florida, the Electoral College ensures that it receives more attention from presidential candidates. This ensures that candidates do not solely focus on the most populous states, thus giving a voice to the citizens of smaller states.

Lastly, the Electoral College prevents the need for run-off elections by producing a clear winner. This avoids further complicating the presidential election process and maintains stability and efficiency in the election outcome.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a critical component of our democratic system. By maintaining this system, we can ensure that citizens from all regions of the country have a voice in the presidential elections, prevent prolonged legal battles, and provide stability and fairness in the election process. Although critics argue for a direct popular vote, it is essential to consider the benefits that the Electoral College provides, including certainty of outcome, regional representation, swing state influence, balancing large and small state interests, and avoiding run-off elections.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will carefully consider the importance of preserving the Electoral College. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or require further information.

81958a1a,"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Over the years, there has been a growing trend in various parts of the world to limit car usage in order to promote smarter planning, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and create more sustainable communities. This shift in thinking has led to the development of car-free neighborhoods, driving bans due to pollution, and initiatives like car-free days. By limiting car usage, we can experience several benefits that positively impact our environment and overall quality of life.

One major advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. It is widely known that passenger cars are a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe, for example, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of these emissions. By reducing our dependency on cars, we can significantly decrease these emissions and contribute to the fight against climate change. This is especially crucial in car-intensive areas in the United States, where cars account for up to 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions.

In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, limiting car usage has several positive effects on public health. Car-free neighborhoods and initiatives like car-free days create an environment that promotes walking, biking, and the use of public transportation. This active lifestyle helps to combat sedentary behavior and its associated health problems, such as obesity and cardiovascular disease. By encouraging more physical activity, we can improve the overall health and well-being of our communities.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of traffic congestion. Suburbs that are designed with smart planning principles, like Vauban in Germany, have seen a significant decrease in traffic. Without cars on the streets, these neighborhoods become more accessible for pedestrians and cyclists. As a result, there is less congestion and more freedom of movement. This not only saves time for residents but also contributes to a safer and more enjoyable neighborhood environment.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to more sustainable and compact communities. By placing stores within walking distance and implementing better public transportation systems, we can reduce the need for long-distance car travel. This new approach to community development allows for more efficient land use and reduces the reliance on cars as the primary mode of transportation. As a result, we can create more livable neighborhoods that prioritize human connection and sustainability.

In conclusion, there are several advantages to limiting car usage. By doing so, we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve public health, decrease traffic congestion, and create more sustainable communities. With the growing recognition of the negative impacts of car culture, it is important to embrace alternatives and work towards a future that is less dependent on cars. In doing this, we can create a healthier, greener, and more enjoyable environment for all.",1,0.9942676,1,True
falcon_180b_v1_317,"With the growing popularity of social media platforms, users have become more and more comfortable sharing their personal information online. However, this trend is concerning as it raises important questions about privacy protection. While some may argue that stronger privacy protections are necessary to safeguard personal information on social media, others believe that such measures are not required. In my opinion, there should definitely be stronger privacy protections on social media platforms.

Firstly, stronger privacy protections are vital in preventing identity theft and cyberbullying. Cybercriminals are constantly on the lookout for ways to steal personal information like credit card details, phone numbers, and addresses. With stronger privacy protections in place, users can better protect themselves from falling victim to such crimes. Additionally, social media platforms are notorious for cyberbullying. With stronger privacy protections, users can feel safer knowing that their information is not being misused or shared without their consent.

Secondly, stronger privacy protections on social media platforms are important for protecting the privacy of young people. Many young people today have grown up with a social media presence, and they may be unaware of the potential consequences of sharing their personal information. By providing stronger privacy protections, we can help young people to navigate these platforms with greater safety.

Finally, stronger privacy protections on social media platforms are essential in ensuring that users have control over their personal information. Users have the right to know who has access to their data, and they should have the ability to control how that data is used. With stronger privacy protections in place, users will have greater control over their data, and they will feel more confident that their rights are being respected.

In conclusion, the rise of social media has led to an increase in the amount of personal information shared online. It is crucial that stronger privacy protections are put into place to safeguard the personal information of users on these platforms. By doing so, we can protect against cybercrime, cyberbullying, and help young people to navigate these platforms with greater safety. Additionally, stronger privacy protections will ensure that users have control over their personal information, and that their rights are being respected.",1,0.9945892,1,True

BD8683F93B5A,"Hey, it's me, your average 8th grade student! 😅 For my essay, I'm gonna talk about how students should be able to decide if they wanna work with a group or alone on their school assignments. Here are my thoughts! 🤔

So, the pros of working alone are that you can do things at your own pace, and you don't have to worry about anyone else messing up. Plus, you can be more creative and come up with your own ideas without anyone else influencing you. That's pretty cool! 🤓

But, there are also some pros to working in a group! When you work with others, you can bounce ideas off each other and come up with better solutions. You can also learn from each other and teach each other new things. Plus, it's way more fun to work with friends! 😃

Now, I think working with a group could be the best choice for students because it helps us learn how to work together and communicate effectively. When we're in school, we're gonna have to work with lots of different people on projects and assignments, so it's good to practice now. Plus, it's just more fun! 🎉

But, some people might say that working alone is better because they like to have control over their work and don't want anyone else to change it. That's cool too! Everyone's different, and it's important to respect each other's choices. 🤝

So, in conclusion, I think students should have the option to decide if they wanna work with a group or alone on their school assignments. Both options have their pros and cons, but I think working with a group could be the best choice because it helps us learn how to work together and communicate effectively.

D87F1B0CE93F,"Being active and working towards a goal can be highly beneficial for individuals of all ages. While it may seem counterintuitive, being always busy and striving for something can have a positive impact on our mental and physical health.

Firstly, being active and working towards a goal can help us to stay focused and motivated. When we have a clear objective in mind, we are more likely to stay on track and avoid getting sidetracked by distractions. This can lead to increased productivity and a sense of accomplishment, which can boost our self-esteem and confidence.

Secondly, being active and working towards a goal can also help us to develop important skills such as time management, problem-solving, and perseverance. These skills can be applied to other areas of our lives, such as school, work, and personal relationships.

For example, consider a student who is working towards a goal of getting good grades in school. By staying focused and motivated, they are able to manage their time effectively, prioritize their studies, and seek help when needed. This can lead to improved academic performance and a greater sense of achievement.

Furthermore, being active and working towards a goal can also have a positive impact on our physical health. Exercise and physical activity have been shown to reduce stress, improve mood, and boost energy levels. By staying busy and active, we can also reduce the risk of developing chronic health conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.

In conclusion, while it may seem counterintuitive, being always busy and striving for something can be highly beneficial for individuals of all ages. By staying focused, motivated, and active, we can develop important skills, improve our mental and physical health, and achieve our goals.

BEC3906A1122,"Curfews are an important part of the teenage experience. Having a curfew can provide a sense of safety for adolescents, as well as set up good habits for the future. The primary focus of a curfew is to keep teenagers safe; as teenagers gain more freedom, curfews help enforce a range of limits that are necessary for their safety. A curfew also helps identify appropriate times for teens to come home, allowing parents to relax knowing when their children will be home and safe.

Another reason for a curfew is that it sets the stage for developing responsible habits. Sufficient sleep plays a vital role in teenagers' growth and development, and setting a reasonable curfew helps promote healthy sleeping habits. Additionally, having a curfew can instill respect for authority and encourage teens to take responsibility for their obligations.

Not everyone agrees that imposing a curfew is beneficial. Many people argue that curfews are too restrictive and infringe on teenagers’ freedom. It is important to consider these arguments when establishing a curfew for your teens. However, with the right amount of guidance and discussion, most families can work together to create an effective curfew that meets their needs. 

In conclusion, teenage curfews provide essential safety, promote healthy habits, and encourage responsibility. Although having a curfew might not be well-received by some teenagers, the long-term outcomes are worth the initial conflict.",1,0.9944411,1,True
7311488b,"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage has numerous advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. This is evident in the examples of Vauban, Paris, and Bogota, where efforts to reduce car usage have resulted in positive outcomes. By adopting a car-free lifestyle, communities can experience improved quality of life, reduced carbon emissions, and less congestion.

One major advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement in quality of life for residents. In the German suburb of Vauban, where cars are prohibited in most areas, residents have reported increased happiness and reduced stress levels. The absence of cars allows for peaceful and quiet streets, where the sound of bicycles and children playing replaces the noise of engines (Rosenthal, 3). This creates a more pleasant living environment and fosters a sense of community.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. Cars are responsible for a significant portion of emissions, particularly in car-intensive areas. For example, in Europe, passenger cars contribute to 12% of greenhouse gas emissions, while in some parts of the United States, this number can reach 50% (Rosenthal, 5). By reducing car ownership and promoting alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, or public transit, communities can significantly decrease their carbon footprint and contribute to a cleaner and healthier environment.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in traffic congestion. In Paris, a partial driving ban was enforced to clear the air during a period of intense smog. As a result, congestion in the city decreased by 60% (Duffer, 14). By reducing the number of cars on the road, traffic flow improves, leading to shorter commute times and less frustration for drivers. Additionally, limiting car usage can free up space on the streets, allowing for the development of more pedestrian-friendly infrastructure and the promotion of active transportation.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has several advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. It can improve quality of life, reduce carbon emissions, and alleviate traffic congestion. The examples of Vauban, Paris, and Bogota demonstrate the positive impacts that can result from adopting a car-free lifestyle. By promoting alternative modes of transportation and implementing smart planning strategies, communities can reap the benefits of reduced car usage. It is clear that limiting car usage is a step towards a more sustainable and livable future.",1,0.9937968,1,True
EA5B3C8E09D1,"Ugh, I don't even know if I want to write this essay. It's like, positivity is totally overrated. But I guess I'll give it a shot.

So, the statement ""positivity is the key to finding success"" is like, super common. Everyone's always talking about how you gotta be positive and stuff. But I think it's actually kind of a load of crap.

First of all, positivity doesn't always lead to success. Like, have you heard of the term ""survivor's guilt""? It's when someone survives something really traumatic and they're like, totally messed up afterwards. They can't even function because they're so consumed by their feelings of guilt and sadness. That doesn't sound very successful to me.

And what about all the successful people who are like, super negative? Think about it. Elon Musk, he's always talking about how he's like, ""Oh man, the world is gonna end in like, 10 years"" or whatever. But he's still super successful. So, maybe negativity isn't always a bad thing.

Plus, positivity can be like, super fake. People are always trying to be all like, ""Oh, everything's gonna be okay!"" Even when it's not. And that's just not real. It's like, how can you expect to find success if you're not being honest with yourself and others?

And finally, success isn't always about being positive. Sometimes it's about being realistic and practical. Like, if you're trying to start a business, you gotta be realistic about the challenges you're gonna face and the hard work it's gonna take to make it successful. You can't just be all like, ""Oh, I'm gonna be a billionaire by next week!"" That's not how it works.

So, in conclusion, positivity might not be the key to finding success. It's important to be realistic and honest about your goals and challenges, and to not be afraid to be negative sometimes. Thanks for reading, I guess. (Sigh)",1,0.99410594,1,True
F123CF0BF9DB,"Making your own decisions and creating your own rules has numerous benefits. Perhaps the most obvious one is that it allows us to take ownership of our lives, and to shape our own destinies. When we are in control of our own decisions, we are in a position to create the life we want--and to make sure it lives up to our expectations.

Having the power to make our own decisions and create our own rules also helps us to develop personal autonomy. It allows us to express our identities and values, rather than having to conform to the rules and decisions of others. Doing so helps to foster self-confidence, and being able to choose for ourselves what our lives look like inspires a sense of dignity and respect.

Moreover, taking charge of our lives gives us the opportunity to practice critical thinking and problem solving. When we are not just following orders, but rather determining our own goals and building strategies to achieve those goals, we hone our creative and analytic skills. This gives us a greater capacity to handle more complex situations down the line.

CA290993DFBA,"While online classes offer the convenience of being able to access course materials and lectures without having to attend in-person classes, they can also have some disadvantages for students. One of the biggest challenges with virtual learning is that it is easy to get distracted and not pay attention for the duration of the lecture. This can cause students to miss important points and comprehension of the material being discussed. Furthermore, not taking notes can also have a negative effect on learning, as it is critical for students to capture all relevant information and ideas from the lecture to be able to process it later. 

Online classes can be difficult for some students because of the self-discipline that is required in order to effectively learn and retain information. Furthermore, the lack of face-to-face interaction can make it more difficult to build a sense of community within the classroom, which can be beneficial to many students. Additionally, it can be difficult to have meaningful discussions with classmates over the internet, which can limit opportunities for critical thinking and collaboration. 

Overall, while online classes have the potential to provide students with convenience and flexibility when it comes to their education, it is important to consider the potential drawbacks as well. If students are unable to stay focused and take notes, they may not get the full educational experience that is available in an in-person setting. Furthermore, the lack of face-to-face interaction can make it more difficult for students to build meaningful connections.

So, you know how some schools have those really old teachers who are like, super wise and stuff? And then they have those really young teachers who are like, really energetic and fun? Well, I think it would be really cool if we had both kinds of teachers in the same program! Like, imagine having an older teacher who's really good at explaining things and stuff, but also has a younger teacher who's really good at, like, making things fun and stuff.

I think older students can really help improve the performance of younger students. Like, imagine if you're a really good basketball player, but you're also really good at teaching younger kids how to play. You could teach them all the cool tricks and stuff you've learned, and they would look up to you and be like, ""Wow, you're so cool!"" And then they would want to learn more and get better, and you would be like, ""Yeah, baby! Let's do this!""

And then, on the other hand, younger students can look up to older students as role models. Like, imagine if you're really good at math, and you're in 9th grade, and you're like, ""Hey, I'm really good at this!"" And then younger kids are like, ""Wow, you're so smart!"" And you're like, ""Thanks, dude! I'm glad you think so!"" And then they start to like, try harder and stuff, and you're like, ""Yeah, go for it!""

I think both age groups can benefit from this arrangement. Older students can learn how to be better teachers and leaders, and younger students can learn how to be more confident and stuff. And it's not just about school stuff, it's about life stuff too. Like, older students can teach younger students how to be more responsible and stuff, and younger students can teach older students how to have fun and be more carefree.

So, yeah, I think having an age mix of older and younger students in the same program is a really good idea. It's like, the best of both world",1,0.99416274,1,True
9DD22B9D10F4,"In today's modern world, technology is an integral part of everyone's lives. From the social media platforms that people use to stay connected with others to the devices that allow us to work from anywhere in the world, technology has undeniably reshaped the way that people communicate. Unfortunately, this has led to the limitation of physical human contact, which has had numerous negative impacts on people's health.

Recent studies have found that people who spend less time engaging in face-to-face, social interactions are more likely to suffer from depression, anxiety, and feelings of loneliness. But why is that? Simply put, it's because physical interaction is necessary for human connection. Without it, people do not get the validation and emotional support that they need in order to lead healthy and fulfilling lives. Furthermore, people have become dependent on technology as a crutch--they utilize it as a way to feel connected with others, even when they don't have any real human contact. This disrupts the natural cycle of social interactions and disconnects people from reality, making it difficult for them to form meaningful relationships with others.

My own personal experience has demonstrated the importance of human contact in maintaining one's mental and physical well-being. When I was stuck at home last year due to the pandemic, virtually every interaction I had was through a laptop or phone screen, and I really started to feel the negative effects of it. I found myself anxious and overwhelmed, and I often felt lonely and isolated. It was only when I was able to get out of the house and meet with a few friends in-person that I was able to gain back my sense of control and calm my frazzled nerves.

llama_70b_v1528,"Dear Principal,

I think that policy 1 is the better choice for our school. Here's why:

First, allowing students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch and free time would be really helpful for us. We could use our phones to communicate with our parents or guardians, look up information for our schoolwork, or even play games with our friends. It would make us feel more connected to the rest of the world, and it would be a good way to teach us how to use technology responsibly.

Second, not allowing students to have phones at school at all would be really hard for us. A lot of us rely on our phones to communicate with our parents or guardians after school, and not having them would make it hard for us to let them know when we need to be picked up, or if we need help with something. It would also be really hard for us to do our schoolwork if we can't use our phones to look up information or type up our assignments.

I understand that some people might think that phones are a distraction, but with policy 1, we would still have to turn them off during class time. This way, we could still use our phones during free time, but we wouldn't be able to use them during class, so it wouldn't be a distraction. Plus, it would teach us how to use our phones responsibly, which is an important skill to have.

One of the main benefits of challenging yourself is that it helps you to develop resilience and perseverance. When you take on a difficult task or challenge, you may encounter obstacles and setbacks along the way. However, by pushing through these challenges and continuing to work towards your goal, you will learn to be more resilient and better able to handle difficult situations in the future.

Additionally, challenging yourself can help you to discover new talents and abilities that you may not have known you had. For example, if you have always been afraid of public speaking, taking on a debate or giving a presentation in front of a class can help you to discover your own voice and improve your communication skills.

Another practical example of the importance of challenging yourself is in the realm of academics. By taking on challenging courses and assignments, you can improve your grades and prepare yourself for more advanced coursework in the future. For example, if you are struggling in a particular subject, taking on a more challenging course or seeking additional help from a tutor can help you to improve your understanding and excel in that subject.

In conclusion, challenging yourself is an important part of personal growth and development. By pushing yourself to achieve more and take on new challenges, you can develop resilience, perseverance, and new talents and abilities.

Introduction:

For decades, the Face on Mars has captured the imagination of people around the world. Some have claimed it as evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence or a long-lost Martian civilization. However, NASA scientists have repeatedly explained that this intriguing feature is merely an illusion caused by shadows and lighting conditions. This essay will present claims and evidence supporting the conclusion that the Face on Mars is a natural landform, not an alien artifact.

Body:

Claim 1: NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft first photographed the Cydonia region in 1976, revealing the Face.

Evidence: According to the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars,"" the Viking 1 orbiter captured several images of Mars, including one of the Cydonia region where the Face appears. These photos were taken at low resolution due to technical limitations, which contributed to the blurred and distorted appearance of the Face.

Claim 2: Higher-resolution images taken by later missions reveal the true nature of the Face.

Evidence: As technology advanced, NASA launched subsequent missions with improved cameras, such as the Mars Global Surveyor in 1997 and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter in 2006. The new images showed that the Face was not a distinct structure but rather a mesa—a flat-topped mountain—with eroded slopes and shadows that create the illusion of facial features under certain light conditions.

Claim 3: Pareidolia—the human tendency to perceive familiar patterns in random data—explains why some people see a face in the Martian landscape.

Evidence: Psychologists and neuroscientists have studied pareidolia, demonstrating how our brains are wired to recognize faces even when they do not exist. This phenomenon can lead us to see faces in clouds, rock formations, or even toast. In the case of the Face on Mars, our brains interpret random shadows and shapes on the Martian surface as eyes, nose, and mouth.

Conclusion:

The Face on Mars has intrigued people for decades, sparking debates about possible alien civilizations. However, NASA's repeated explanations and high-resolution imagery confirm that the Face is merely an optical illusion caused by natural geological processes, not an artificial structure created by extraterrestrial beings. By understanding pareidolia and examining the evidence, we can appreciate the beauty",1,0.976592,1,True
DF1D43973CFA,"The idea of a four-day school week with two extra hours of school each day has been gaining popularity in recent years. While some people believe that this would be a great way to improve the quality of education, others argue that it would not be beneficial for students. In this essay, I will argue against the idea of a four-day school week with two extra hours of school each day.

Firstly, the current school schedule of five days a week has been proven to be effective in providing students with the necessary education to succeed in life. Studies have shown that students who attend school five days a week perform better academically and are better prepared for college and the workforce. This is because schools are able to provide students with the necessary resources and support to help them succeed. By reducing the number of days in school, schools may not have the time or resources to provide students with the necessary support.

Secondly, a four-day school week would not provide students with enough time to complete all of their coursework. With two extra hours of school each day, students would still only have four days to complete all of their assignments and assessments. This would put a lot of pressure on students to complete their work quickly, which could lead to a decrease in the quality of their work. In addition, students may not have enough time to participate in extracurricular activities or to engage in other activities that are important for their personal and social development.

Finally, a four-day school week would be difficult for many families to adjust to. Many families rely on the current school schedule to balance their work and family responsibilities. By reducing the number of days in school, families may have to make significant changes to their schedules, which could be difficult and stressful. In addition, some families may not be able to afford to take time off from work to care for their children during the extra hours of school.

In conclusion, while the idea of a four-day school week with two extra hours of school each day may seem like a good idea, it is not practical or beneficial for students. The current school schedule of five days a week has been proven to be effective in providing students with the necessary education to succeed in life, and reducing the number of days in school could lead to a decrease in the quality of education and a decrease in the opportunities available to students.

985A32A20F03,"Starting a career at a young age has been a topic of debate for many years. While some people believe that young people are more ambitious and energetic, others argue that they need more experience and education to succeed in their careers. In this essay, I will explore the pros and cons of starting a career at a young age and provide evidence to support my opinion.

On the one hand, starting a career at a young age has several advantages. Firstly, young people tend to be more ambitious and energetic, which can help them succeed in their careers. They have more time to learn and grow, which can lead to greater success in the long run. Additionally, young people tend to be more open-minded and adaptable, which can help them navigate the ever-changing job market.

For example, doctors and lawyers often start their careers at a young age. They go to medical or law school, complete their residency or clerkship, and then begin practicing their profession. By starting early, they have more time to gain experience and build their reputation in their field. This can lead to greater opportunities for advancement and higher salaries.

On the other hand, starting a career at a young age also has some disadvantages. Firstly, young people may not have the same level of experience and expertise as more experienced professionals. This can make it difficult for them to compete in certain industries or roles. Additionally, young people may not have the same level of financial stability as more experienced professionals, which can make it difficult for them to support themselves and their families.

For example, teachers often start their careers at a young age. While they may be passionate about teaching and eager to make a difference, they may not have the same level of experience and expertise as more experienced teachers. This can make it difficult for them to effectively manage a classroom and provide the best possible education for their students.

In conclusion, starting a career at a young age has both advantages and disadvantages. While young people tend to be more ambitious and energetic, they may not have the same level of experience and expertise as more experienced professionals. Ultimately, the decision to start a career at a young age should be based on individual circumstances and goals. It is important for young people to carefully consider the pros and cons and make an informed decision that is best for their future.",1,0.9946321,1,True
A263E403FAC3,"Sure, here's my essay response:

As an 8th grader, I'm starting to think about my future career and what I want to be when I grow up. One career that really interests me is becoming a pilot. I think it would be so cool to fly planes and travel to different places. But, I know it's not just a dream job, it requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

So, I started researching careers related to becoming a pilot and the requirements for these careers. I found out that becoming a pilot requires a lot of education and training. You need to have a high school diploma or equivalent, and then you can apply to a flight school or aviation college. These programs can take a few years to complete and they teach you everything you need to know to become a pilot, including how to fly planes, navigate, and maintain them.

But, I also realized that not all high schools offer courses or qualifications related to becoming a pilot. Some schools might have aviation clubs or programs, but these are usually only available to a select few students. So, I started looking for high schools that offer these types of programs. I found out that there are a few schools in my area that have aviation programs, but they're really competitive and only accept a few students each year.

Another thing I'm thinking about is how I'm going to get to school every day if I can't drive. I live about 30 minutes away from school, so it would be really hard to commute every day without a car. So, I started researching the options for transportation to and from school. I found out that there are a few bus routes that go near my school, but they don't always run on time and they can be really crowded. I'm also thinking about getting a bike or using ride-sharing services, but I'm not sure if those are safe or reliable.

One of the benefits of committing to a career at a young age is that you can start gaining experience and building your skills before you even graduate high school. This can give you a big advantage when you're applying to colleges or jobs. But, I know it's not always easy to commit to a career at such a young age. It",1,0.99434704,1,True

First off, let's talk about the pros. 👍 One of the main advantages is that it would give students more time to relax and recharge. 💤 Like, we already have a lot of homework and stuff, so having an extra day off would be super helpful. Plus, it would give us more time to pursue our interests and hobbies outside of school. 🎨🏀

Another pro is that it could help reduce the workload for teachers. 📝 They already have a lot on their plates, so having an extra day off would give them a chance to catch up on grading and lesson planning. 📝👨‍🏫

But, there are also some cons to consider. 🤔 One of them is that it could impact extracurricular activities. 🏈🎸 Like, if we have a four-day week, some sports teams might have to practice or compete on the weekends, which could be tough for students who have other commitments. 🤷‍♀️

Another con is that it could affect the quality of education. 📚 If we have fewer days in the classroom, we might not be able to cover as much material or get as much support from our teachers. 🤔👨‍🏫

In my opinion, the pros and cons of a four-day school week are pretty evenly matched. 🤔 It's like, on one hand, it would be nice to have more time off, but on the other hand, it could impact our extracurricular activities and education. 🤷‍♀️📚

7B557B2F27CE,"Essay: The Importance of Imagination vs. Knowledge

Imagination and knowledge are two concepts that are often seen as opposites, but they are actually complementary and essential for our growth and development. While knowledge provides us with facts and information, imagination allows us to think creatively and envision new possibilities. In this essay, I will argue that imagination is just as important as knowledge, and that the two are interconnected.

On one hand, knowledge is crucial for understanding the world around us. It helps us learn new things, solve problems, and make informed decisions. Without knowledge, we would not be able to appreciate the beauty of science, history, or literature. Knowledge gives us a foundation to build upon and helps us understand the complexities of life. For example, knowing about different cultures and traditions helps us appreciate their unique perspectives and values.

On the other hand, imagination is what sets us apart from other living beings. It allows us to dream, to create, and to innovate. Imagination is what enables us to envision a better future, to imagine new possibilities, and to bring our ideas to life. Without imagination, we would not have art, music, or literature. Imagination is what makes life interesting and exciting. For instance, imagine if Leonardo da Vinci had not imagined the helicopter, we would not have this amazing invention today.

However, imagination and knowledge are not mutually exclusive. In fact, they are interconnected and complement each other. Knowledge provides us with the foundation to imagine new possibilities, and imagination inspires us to seek out new knowledge. For example, understanding the principles of physics allows us to imagine new machines and technologies. Imagination can also help us to find new solutions to problems, and to apply knowledge in creative ways.

In conclusion, imagination and knowledge are both important, but they serve different purposes. While knowledge provides us with facts and information, imagination inspires us to think creatively and to envision new possibilities. The two are interconnected, and they are essential for our growth and development. So, let us embrace both imagination and knowledge, and use them to create a better future for ourselves and for generations to come.",1,0.9945522,1,True
llama_70b_v1681,"Marijuana is a drug that has been around for a long time, and it's use has been a controversial topic for just as long. Some people think it should be legal, while others think it should stay illegal. In my opinion, marijuana should be legalized.

First of all, marijuana is not a dangerous drug. It's not addictive like heroin or cocaine, and it doesn't cause you to do crazy things like LSD or meth. In fact, studies have shown that marijuana is less harmful than alcohol and tobacco, which are both legal. So, if we can legalize those drugs, why not marijuana?

Another reason marijuana should be legal is that it could be a big money maker for the government. If marijuana was legal, the government could tax it and make a lot of money off of it. This money could be used to fund important things like education and healthcare. Plus, legalizing marijuana would create jobs and stimulate the economy.

Furthermore, marijuana has a lot of medical benefits. It can help people with chronic pain, nausea, and even cancer. It's also a natural way to relax and reduce stress, which is something a lot of people need. If marijuana was legal, more people would be able to access these benefits and live healthier lives.

Finally, it's not fair to punish people for using a drug that is not harmful. The war on drugs has led to a lot of people being arrested and put in jail for using marijuana, which is not right. People should be able to make their own choices about what they put in their bodies, and they shouldn't be punished for it.

In conclusion, marijuana should be legalized. It's not a dangerous drug, it could be a big money maker for the government, it has medical benefits, and it's not fair to punish people for using it.

Being our authentic selves helps us maintain a sense of self-acceptance and inner peace, as we find joy and contentment within our own unique quirks and qualities. Embracing our original identities allows us to enjoy everything life has to offer without feeling the pressure to conform or meet unrealistic expectations. 

Living an honest and genuine life can also be beneficial on a larger scale. Whether it’s through our relationships with family, friends, colleagues, or the larger society, authenticity encourages honest and positive interactions. It is only through showing our true selves that we can achieve meaningful, deep connections with others that will benefit us in the long run. 

On the other hand, wearing a fake persona can hide our underlying insecurities, but it does not lead to true contentment or lasting relationships. Having to pretend to be someone we’re not can sometimes have negative consequences, such as confusing our true identity or bringing us unhappiness. Ultimately, being ourselves is far more beneficial than trying to be something we’re not.

692FAA1828D2,"As an eighth-grade student, I have learned that spending time outdoors can be incredibly beneficial for both physical and mental health. In this essay, I will explore various activities that can be done outdoors, the benefits of being outdoors, compare different activities, consider how to provide assistance to those in need while enjoying the outdoors, and develop a plan for people to get fit and enjoy their time outside.

First, I will research activities that can be done outdoors. Some popular options include biking, running, swimming, and hiking. Each of these activities has its own unique benefits, such as building endurance, improving cardiovascular health, and reducing stress. Additionally, outdoor activities provide an opportunity to enjoy nature, spend time with family and friends, and meet new people.

Next, I will investigate the benefits of being outdoors. One of the most significant benefits is the opportunity to spend quality time with family and friends. Outdoor activities can be a fun and engaging way to bond with loved ones and create lasting memories. Additionally, being outdoors can improve mental health by reducing stress and promoting relaxation.

When comparing different activities, it's important to consider the health and lifestyle benefits. For example, biking and running are great cardiovascular workouts that can help improve endurance and overall fitness. Swimming is a low-impact exercise that can be done in a variety of settings, including outdoor pools or lakes. Hiking is an excellent way to explore nature and get some fresh air, but it may not provide as much cardiovascular benefit as other activities.

To provide assistance to those in need while enjoying the outdoors, there are several options. One idea is to participate in volunteer work, such as cleaning up a local park or participating in a beach or river cleanup. Additionally, outdoor activities can be a great way to raise awareness and funds for important causes, such as environmental conservation or disaster relief efforts.

Finally, to help people get fit and enjoy their time outside, I would recommend developing a plan that includes both exercise and outdoor activities. This plan could include setting goals for physical activity, such as aiming for a certain number of minutes of exercise per day, and incorporating outdoor activities into a weekly routine. Additionally, it's important to make sure that the plan is accessible and enjoyable for all individuals, regardless of their fitness level or abilities.

llama_70b_v1889,"In recent years, many schools have implemented policies that allow parents to monitor their children's grades and attendance online. While this practice has its benefits, I believe that it is ultimately harmful to students.

Firstly, allowing parents to monitor their children's grades and attendance online can create an environment of constant scrutiny and pressure. Students may feel like they are always being watched and judged, which can lead to increased stress and anxiety. This can negatively impact their mental health and overall well-being. For example, a study by the American Psychological Association found that students who experienced high levels of stress were more likely to experience physical health problems, such as headaches and stomachaches, as well as mental health issues like depression and anxiety.

Secondly, the ability for parents to monitor their children's grades and attendance online can undermine the student's sense of autonomy and responsibility. When parents are constantly monitoring their children's progress, it can create a sense of dependency and undermine the student's motivation to take ownership of their learning. Students may feel like they don't have to take responsibility for their own learning, since their parents are always watching and will alert them to any problems. This can lead to a lack of initiative and independence, which are important skills for success in life.

Furthermore, the ability for parents to monitor their children's grades and attendance online can create an unequal playing field. Not all students have access to the same technology or support at home, which can create a disadvantage for those who do not have the same resources. For example, a student who does not have access to a computer or internet at home may not be able to check their grades or attendance as easily as their peers who do. This can lead to a widening of the achievement gap and create a greater disparity in educational opportunities.

Finally, allowing parents to monitor their children's grades and attendance online can create a culture of competition and comparison. When parents are able to see their child's grades and attendance in real-time, they may become overly focused on their child's performance and compare it to that of their peers. This can create a culture of competition, where students feel like they need to constantly prove themselves and outperform their peers. This can lead to an unhealthy focus on grades and achievement, rather than a focus on learning and personal growth.

In conclusion, while the ability for parents to monitor their children's grades and attendance online may seem like a useful tool, it can ultimately be harmful to students. It can create an environment of constant scrutiny and pressure, undermine the student's sense of autonomy and responsibility, create an unequal playing field, and foster a culture of competition and comparison.

As technology continues to advance, schools around the world are integrating cell phones into the classroom to enhance learning. While this may seem like a great idea, there are potential negative effects that need to be considered. In this essay, I will research what schools are doing to integrate cell phones for educational purposes, analyze the potential negative effects, look into examples of students relying too much on technology, discuss possible ways to keep students focused, and research how implementing cell phones for educational purposes affects the students' overall learning.

Firstly, many schools are using cell phones to enhance the learning experience by providing students with access to educational apps, online resources, and communication tools. For example, some schools use messaging apps to communicate with students and their parents, while others use apps to provide students with virtual textbooks and educational games. However, there are also potential negative effects to consider. For instance, excessive screen time can lead to a decrease in attention span and an increase in distractions, which can negatively impact the learning process.

Furthermore, there are examples of students relying too much on technology to complete academic tasks. For instance, a student may rely on their phone to take notes instead of actively listening and engaging in class discussions. This can lead to a lack of understanding of the material and a decrease in critical thinking skills. Additionally, over-reliance on technology can lead to a lack of creativity and problem-solving skills, as students may rely on their phones to solve problems instead of thinking critically.

To keep students focused while using cell phones for learning, schools can implement rules and guidelines for their use. For instance, students can be required to keep their phones in a designated area, such as a phone bin, during class time. This can help to minimize distractions and ensure that students are fully engaged in the learning process. Additionally, teachers can provide students with interactive activities and games that promote critical thinking and problem-solving skills, rather than relying solely on technology.

He's saying that it's okay to make mistakes, but it's important to try your best and not give up.

Being self-reliant is important because it makes you more independent. When you can take care of yourself, you don't have to rely on anyone else to do things for you. It's like when you're playing a game and you have to make a decision, you don't want to have to ask someone else what to do. You want to be able to make your own decisions and figure things out on your own.

But there are also some disadvantages to being self-reliant. Sometimes it can be hard to ask for help when you need it. Like if you're playing a game and you make a mistake, you might feel embarrassed to ask someone else for advice. And if you're not used to asking for help, it can be hard to know when you should ask for it.

Another thing is that when you're self-reliant, you might not always have the best advice. Sometimes other people might know better than you what to do in a situation, and if you're not willing to listen to them, you might make a mistake. But on the other hand, if you're always relying on someone else for advice, you might not be learning how to make good decisions on your own.

llama_70b_v1786,"Dear State Senator,

I am writing to express my opinion on the topic of the Electoral College. I believe that it is important for the United States to keep the Electoral College system for electing the president. The Electoral College ensures that smaller states have a voice in the election and prevents larger states from having too much power.

One of the main arguments against the Electoral College is that it can lead to a situation where the winner of the popular vote does not win the presidency. However, this has only happened five times in the history of the United States, and it is a rare occurrence. Additionally, the Electoral College system encourages candidates to campaign in a variety of states, rather than just focusing on the most populous ones. This ensures that candidates are aware of the needs and concerns of people from all over the country, rather than just those in heavily populated areas.

Another argument in favor of the Electoral College is that it prevents the president from being chosen by a purely urban majority. The United States is a diverse country with many different populations and regions, and the Electoral College ensures that all of these regions have a say in the election. Without the Electoral College, candidates would only need to focus on the largest cities and urban areas, and the needs of rural areas and smaller cities would be ignored.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system is established by the Constitution and has been a part of American democracy for over two centuries. Changing the system now would be a significant departure from the principles that have guided our country for so long. It is important to respect the Constitution and the system that has been in place for so long, rather than trying to change it for the sake of change.

In conclusion, I believe that the Electoral College system is an important part of American democracy and should be kept in place. It ensures that smaller states have a voice, prevents the president from being chosen by a purely urban majority, and is established by the Constitution. I urge you to consider these points and vote to keep the Electoral College system.

While both methods have their own unique features, it is important to compare and contrast them to determine which is the best fit for a student's learning style and needs.

One of the biggest advantages of attending classes at school is the opportunity to interact with other students and teachers on a face-to-face basis. This allows for the development of relationships and the exchange of ideas that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual environment. Additionally, attending classes at school provides a structured schedule and routine that can help students stay organized and focused on their studies.

On the other hand, distance learning offers a level of flexibility and convenience that can be difficult to find in a traditional classroom setting. With distance learning, students can complete their coursework at their own pace, allowing them to balance their studies with other commitments such as work or family responsibilities. Additionally, distance learning often allows for more personalized attention from teachers, as they can provide individualized feedback and support to students.

Despite the advantages of both methods, there are also some disadvantages to consider. For example, attending classes at school can be expensive, as students may need to pay for transportation, textbooks, and other materials. Additionally, distance learning can be isolating, as students may miss out on the social interactions and support that come with attending classes at school.

In conclusion, both distance learning and attending classes at school have their own unique features and advantages. Ultimately, the best approach will depend on a student's individual learning style and needs.

Okay, so here's the thing: being an action taker is way better than just sitting around and dreaming about stuff.  Like, sure, it's cool to have big ideas and imagine all the amazing things you could do, but at the end of the day, it's the people who take action who actually make things happen. 

First off, taking action helps you build confidence.  When you actually do something, even if it's scary or hard, you feel more confident in yourself and your abilities. Like, you're like, ""Hey, I did that thing I was afraid of, and it turned out okay!""  And that builds up your confidence to take on even bigger things.

Another reason is that taking action can lead to new opportunities.  Like, if you're just sitting around dreaming about something, you might not even realize that there are ways to make it happen. But if you take action, you might discover new paths or resources that you never knew existed. It's like, you're not limited to just one way of doing things, you know? 

And lastly, taking action can help you make a difference.  Like, if you see a problem in your community or in the world, and you take action to try to fix it, you can make a real impact.

Schools should encourage students to get involved in different activities, so they can learn new skills and make new friends. But at the same time, they shouldn't force them to do something they don't want to do.

Like, imagine if a student really wants to focus on their schoolwork and just do one or two extracurrs. That's totally fine! Schools should respect their decision and let them do what they want. But if a student is struggling in school and needs to get involved in extracurrs to improve their grades, schools should step in and help them find something that's gonna benefit them.

Another scenario is when a student is in a sport or club that's super time-consuming. In that case, schools should work with the student and their family to find a balance that works for everyone. Maybe the student can do a different extracurr in the same school day, or they can do it after school.

In conclusion, schools should kinda control how many extracurricular activities a student participates in, but they should also respect the student's choices and work with them to find a balance that works for everyone. It's important for students to have a good balance between schoolwork and extracurrs, but also to have the freedom to choose what they want to do.",1,0.99338865,1,True
D8FCB1AB9867,"In today's increasingly competitive job market, it is important for students to commit to a career path at a young age. One way to do this is to take advantage of the resources offered by schools, like the help of teachers and access to career counselors.

Furthermore, commitment to a career can help create a sense of independence, allowing students to make crucial decisions for their own future.

7837c084,"The advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and wide-ranging. Limiting car usage can have positive effects on the environment, public health, and the overall quality of life for citizens.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, which are a leading cause of climate change. The passage states that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage and promoting alternative modes of transportation such as walking, cycling, and public transit, we can significantly reduce the amount of greenhouse gases being released into the atmosphere.

In addition to reducing emissions, limiting car usage can also have a positive impact on air quality. The passage about Paris banning driving due to smog highlights how car emissions can contribute to poor air quality, with levels of particulate matter in the air exceeding those in other European capitals. By limiting car usage, especially in densely populated areas, we can reduce air pollution and improve public health.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to more compact and accessible communities. The passage mentions the German suburb of Vauban, where cars are generally forbidden and streets are designed to be car-free. This type of smart planning can create communities where amenities such as stores and public transportation are within walking distance, reducing the need for lengthy car trips. This not only makes it more convenient for residents to access necessities but also promotes physical activity and social interaction.

Limiting car usage can also have economic benefits. The passage mentions how delivery companies in Paris complained of lost revenue during the driving ban, but exceptions were made for electric and hybrid vehicles. This indicates that promoting alternative modes of transportation, such as electric cars or bicycles, can support new industries and create job opportunities.

Finally, limiting car usage can have a positive impact on overall quality of life. The passage about the car-free day in Bogota highlights how banning cars for a day can create a sense of community and reduce stress. By limiting car usage and promoting alternative modes of transportation, we can create more pedestrian-friendly streets, reduce traffic congestion, and create safer and more enjoyable public spaces.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, from reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality to creating more compact and accessible communities and improving overall quality of life. By promoting alternative modes of transportation and implementing smart planning principles, we can create a more sustainable and livable future.",1,0.99337584,1,True
E0B4FCC6FD58,"Working in a group versus working alone on an assigned task can be a tricky decision. There are distinct pros and cons to consider when deciding which method to use. 

One of the major benefits of working in a group is the synergy that can be created. Each group member brings their own, unique set of skills to the table and can help build upon one another’s ideas. As a result, the group is able to create a better solution to the problem than what could have been produced by a single person.

Working alone can also have its advantages. For instance, it can be easier to concentrate on the task at hand without the distractions and noise that can occur in large groups. Personal creativity can also be better realized when you are working on a task by yourself. 

On the other hand, working alone can sometimes be isolating and can lead to the task taking longer than it would take with a group. In a group, different individuals can work in tandem and fill in for when others get stuck. Working alone can also lead to ineffective communication and, in the case of major projects, it can be hard to know where to start.

In conclusion, there are pros and cons to both working with a group and working alone on an assigned task. Ultimately, the best approach to take depends on the individual task and the resources available. It is important to postpone judgment until the different options have been properly weighed.",1,0.99458367,1,True
llama_70b_v1195,"I think marijuana should be legalized. There's lots of reasons why. First of all, its not fair to put people in jail for smoking a plant. Its not hurting nobody. If people want to smoke it, they should be able to. Its their choice.

Another reason is that it would help the government make money. They could tax it and use the money for good things like schools and hospitals. Plus, it would create jobs for people who want to work in the marijuana industry.

Also, it would help reduce crime. If people could buy marijuana legally, they wouldn't have to buy it from bad people who might sell them bad drugs or hurt them. And the police wouldn't have to waste their time arresting people for smoking marijuana.

Some people might say that marijuana is bad for you, but so is alcohol and cigarettes. People are allowed to buy those things, so why not marijuana?

I know some people might be worried about kids smoking marijuana, but they can't buy it legally anyway. Its not like they can just walk into a store and buy it. They would have to get it from somewhere else, and that's not safe.

So, in conclusion, marijuana should be legalized. Its not fair to keep it illegal, it would help the government make money, reduce crime, and people should be able to make their own choices about what they want to do.

EB3D751AD980,"As an 8th-grade student, I have always been curious about what subjects are taught in elementary school. I believe that understanding the different subjects taught in elementary school can help me become a better teacher in the future. To learn more about this topic, I talked to current teachers about their teaching styles and techniques for engaging students. I also researched how to make lessons interesting and engaging for elementary school students. Additionally, I talked to family members and friends about their elementary school experiences and observed students in an elementary school to see how they interact and learn.

After conducting my research, I found that there are several subjects taught in elementary school, including math, science, social studies, language arts, and physical education. Each of these subjects has its own unique approach to teaching, and teachers use different techniques to engage students. For example, in math, teachers often use visual aids and hands-on activities to help students understand abstract concepts. In science, teachers use experiments and demonstrations to teach students about the natural world. In social studies, teachers use real-world examples and role-playing activities to help students understand historical events and cultural differences. In language arts, teachers use a variety of teaching methods, including reading, writing, and speaking, to help students develop their language skills. Finally, in physical education, teachers use games and activities to help students develop their physical fitness and coordination.

In addition to the different subjects taught in elementary school, teachers also use different techniques to engage students. Some teachers use a direct instruction approach, where they provide clear instructions and examples to students, while others use a student-centered approach, where they encourage students to take an active role in their learning. Some teachers also use technology, such as interactive whiteboards and educational games, to engage students and make lessons more interactive.

To make lessons interesting and engaging for elementary school students, I believe it is important to use a variety of teaching methods and activities. For example, teachers could use games, puzzles, and other interactive activities to help students learn.

falcon_180b_v1_787,"Standardized Testing: An Inaccurate Measure of Student Ability

Standardized testing is a highly debated topic in the world of education. These tests are often used to determine a student's ability, but I believe that they are not an accurate measure of intelligence. In this essay, I will share my reasons and examples to support why standardized testing is flawed.

Firstly, standardized tests only assess a narrow range of skills. These tests tend to focus on reading, writing, and math, which means that other important talents such as creativity, problem-solving, and critical-thinking are not considered. For instance, I know a student in my class who struggles with math but is an excellent artist. However, when it comes to standardized testing, his artistic talents are not considered, and he is judged based solely on his math skills. This approach is unfair and does not give the full picture of a student's abilities.

Secondly, standardized tests do not take into account the different learning styles that students have. Some students are visual learners, while others are auditory or kinesthetic learners. Standardized tests are typically designed to cater to visual learners only, which puts students with different learning styles at a disadvantage. For example, one of my classmates struggles with reading and prefers to learn through hands-on activities. However, during standardized testing, he has to rely on his reading skills, which puts him at a disadvantage compared to visual learners in the same class.

Lastly, standardized tests are often influenced by external factors such as a student's socio-economic background, language proficiency, and prior education. These factors can impact a student's performance on the test, which in turn affects their overall score. For instance, a student who comes from a low-income background may not have access to the same resources as a student from a more affluent family, which can affect their performance on standardized tests. This approach is unfair and does not allow for a level playing field.

In conclusion, standardized tests are an inaccurate measure of student ability. They only assess a narrow range of skills, do not account for different learning styles, and are often influenced by external factors. As a result, we need to find alternative methods of assessing student abilities that are fair, comprehensive, and cater to different learning styles. Only then can we get a true picture of a student's abilities and provide them with the support they need to succeed.",1,0.99445724,1,True
llama_70b_v11083,"Gun control is a really important issue that affects lots of people. I think it's important to have stricter gun control laws because it can help keep people safe.

One reason is that guns can be really dangerous if they're not handled properly. There have been lots of cases where people have accidentally shot themselves or others, and stricter laws could help prevent this. For example, if there were stricter laws, people would have to go through proper training before they could buy a gun, and this would help them understand how to handle it safely.

Another reason is that guns can be used for bad things, like robberies or shootings. If it's harder for people to get guns, it's less likely that these things will happen. For example, in countries where gun control laws are strict, there are fewer gun-related crimes.

Finally, stricter gun control laws could help prevent things like mass shootings. These are really tragic events that can have a big impact on communities. If people didn't have access to guns, it would be less likely that these events would happen.

However, some people might argue that stricter gun control laws would infringe on their rights. They might say that people should be able to own guns for self-defense or hunting. But, I think it's important to consider the greater good. If stricter laws can help keep people safe, then it's worth it.

Overall, I think stricter gun control laws are a good idea. They can help keep people safe, prevent bad things from happening, and make communities better places.",1,0.99404824,1,True
llama_70b_v1492,"As a grade 11 student, I believe that drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. The use of cell phones while driving is a major distraction and can lead to accidents, injuries, and even fatalities.

Firstly, using a cell phone while driving takes away the driver's attention from the road. Texting, calling, or browsing on a phone requires the driver to take their eyes off the road, which can lead to a decrease in reaction time and an increase in the likelihood of accidents. According to statistics, texting while driving is equivalent to driving blindfolded for five seconds at a time. This means that drivers who are texting while driving are essentially driving without looking at the road for short periods of time, which can be extremely dangerous.

Secondly, using a cell phone while driving can cause physical impairment. Drivers who are holding their phones while driving may not have both hands on the wheel, which can affect their ability to control the vehicle. This can be particularly dangerous when driving on uneven roads or in inclement weather conditions. Additionally, using a cell phone while driving can cause drivers to take their eyes off the road, which can lead to a decrease in their peripheral vision and their ability to observe pedestrians, other vehicles, and road signs.

Furthermore, using a cell phone while driving can lead to emotional distraction. Drivers who are engaged in intense conversations or who are reading or sending messages may become emotionally invested in their phones, which can distract them from the task of driving. This can lead to a decrease in their ability to focus on the road and an increase in the likelihood of accidents.

Lastly, there are alternative ways for drivers to communicate while driving. For example, drivers can use hands-free devices, such as Bluetooth headsets, to make and receive calls without having to physically handle their phones. Additionally, drivers can use voice-to-text features to send messages without having to physically type. These alternatives can help drivers to communicate safely while driving, without the risks associated with manual cell phone use.

In conclusion, drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. The use of cell phones while driving is a major distraction that can lead to accidents, injuries, and fatalities. There are alternative ways for drivers to communicate safely while driving, and it is important for drivers to prioritize safety on the road.",1,0.99171805,1,True

So, let's dive in! One of the main advantages of finishing high school in three years is that you can get your driver's license earlier. Like, who doesn't want to hit the open road and cruise around with their BFFs? It's like, a total rite of passage or something. Plus, having a driver's license means you can get a job easier, like at the mall or something.  And let's be real, who doesn't want to earn some extra cash?

One example of the importance of being responsible and hard-working can be seen in the story of Steve Jobs. Jobs started out as a summer intern at Atari in 1973, where he was responsible for designing and implementing the arcade game Spacewar! Despite facing challenges such as limited resources and a lack of experience, Jobs worked tirelessly to create a successful game. His hard work and dedication paid off, and he went on to co-found Apple Inc., one of the most successful technology companies in the world.

Another example is the story of Oprah Winfrey. Winfrey started out as a news anchor in Baltimore, Maryland, where she faced discrimination and challenges due to her gender and race. However, she worked hard to overcome these obstacles and eventually became one of the most influential and successful media personalities in history.

Leaving an excellent record in a job is also important, as it can lead to future opportunities and advancements. Employers look for individuals who have a strong work ethic and are dedicated to their job. A good record can also lead to recommendations and referrals, which can be valuable in the job market.

On the other hand, not following rules can have serious consequences. For example, if an employee consistently fails to meet deadlines or disregards company policies, they may be let go or face disciplinary action. This can damage their reputation and make it difficult for them to find future employment.

C47E98E69AFB,"Enthusiasm is a powerful force that can drive individuals to achieve great success in their endeavors. It is often said that those who are enthusiastic about a particular goal or task are more likely to succeed than those who lack enthusiasm. While this may be true in some cases, I believe that enthusiasm is not always a guarantee of success.

Firstly, enthusiasm can be a double-edged sword. While it can motivate individuals to work harder and push through obstacles, it can also lead to recklessness and impulsive decisions. For example, someone who is enthusiastic about starting a new business may rush into it without thoroughly researching the market or developing a solid business plan. This can ultimately lead to failure.

Secondly, success is often determined by a variety of factors, including hard work, dedication, and perseverance. While enthusiasm can certainly help individuals stay motivated and focused, it is not the only factor that contributes to success. For instance, a person who is enthusiastic about a particular career path may still fail if they lack the necessary skills or experience to excel in that field.

Lastly, success is often a product of luck and circumstance. Even the most enthusiastic individuals can encounter unexpected obstacles or setbacks that can derail their plans. For example, a person who is enthusiastic about starting a new business may face fierce competition or economic downturns that make it difficult to succeed.

In conclusion, while enthusiasm can certainly be a valuable asset in achieving success, it is not a guarantee.

Successful people are those who have developed these traits and have used them to their advantage. They have set high standards for themselves and have worked tirelessly towards achieving them. They have also developed a strong mindset that allows them to overcome obstacles and setbacks. This mindset is often rooted in a belief in their own abilities and a willingness to take risks in order to achieve their goals.

A356547BF789,"In recent years, Generic_School has begun offering a three-year graduation program to its students. This rapid path to graduation enables students to save time, money, and graduate earlier than if they had followed the traditional four-year graduation path. But what are the pros and cons of such a program? And how does it affect the broader student body? 

The primary advantage of the three-year graduation program is that it can enable certain students to save money, time, and graduate earlier than usual. By compressing the traditional four years into three, students can take the same courses to obtain a degree, but faster. This could be especially advantageous for students who are paying their tuition on their own, or who have already found a career path and would like to pursue it as soon as possible. 

However, this program could also have some downsides that must be considered. With less time to experiment with courses, students may end up deciding on an academic path ahead of time without the possibility of changing their mind. Additionally, the three-year program could make it harder for students to receive aid from scholarships and grants. This rapid-path to graduation may also easier for students to feel overwhelmed by the amount of coursework they need to complete in a compressed time-frame.

When it comes to its impact on the broader student body, the three-year graduation program could create a situation of inequity between those who can and cannot take advantage of the program. Additionally, it could create a situation of overcrowding in certain college courses due to the larger number of students taking the same course in one given semester.

According to the passage, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly decrease these emissions. For example, in the German suburb of Vauban, where car ownership is limited and alternative transportation is encouraged, 70 percent of families do not own cars. This leads to a significant reduction in emissions from transportation, benefiting both local and global environments.

Limiting car usage also helps to alleviate traffic congestion. The passage mentions that suburbs are heavily reliant on cars, which leads to increased traffic and congestion. By promoting alternative modes of transportation such as walking, cycling, and public transit, we can reduce the number of cars on the road and ease traffic congestion. For instance, during a car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, the streets were devoid of traffic jams, resulting in a smoother flow of vehicles. By adopting car-reduced or car-free initiatives, cities can reduce congestion and make their transportation systems more efficient.

Another major advantage of limiting car usage is the positive impact it can have on public health. Car-free or car-reduced communities promote physical activity through walking and cycling. These modes of transportation have been shown to improve cardiovascular health, reduce the risk of obesity, and enhance overall well-being. By encouraging people to adopt active transportation options, we can reduce sedentary behavior and promote healthier lifestyles. Furthermore, by reducing the number of cars on the road, we can also improve air quality, leading to fewer respiratory problems and related health issues.

Limiting car usage can also foster community cohesion. The passage highlights how car-free communities like Vauban in Germany promote walking and cycling by placing stores within walking distance rather than in distant malls. This creates a more walkable and interconnected community, where people can interact with their neighbors and have a stronger sense of belonging. By reducing car dependency, people are more likely to engage in their local communities and form meaningful social connections.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. By reducing car dependency, we can improve the environment, reduce traffic congestion, promote health, and enhance community cohesion. Initiatives like car-free days, car-reduced communities, and promoting alternative modes of transportation can help us achieve these benefits. It is crucial for individuals and policymakers to recognize the advantages of limiting car usage and work towards creating more sustainable and livable communities.",1,0.9929877,1,True

On the one hand, requiring all students to participate in an extracurricular activity can have a positive impact on our school community. It can encourage students to get involved in their school and community, and can help them develop new skills and interests. Additionally, it can help students develop social skills and teamwork, which are important for success in the future.

On the other hand, requiring all students to participate in an extracurricular activity can also have negative effects.

This rise in social media usage has given birth to several debates concerning the need for stronger privacy protections on social media. As a student in grade 9, I am in support of stricter privacy protection policies for social media platforms.

Firstly, social media platforms collect a vast amount of data on users. This data includes personal information such as name, age, location, and interests. With the rise of cyber-attacks and data misuse, it is necessary to ensure that this information is kept private and secure. Stronger privacy protection policies would guarantee that the data collected by social media companies is not being used for malicious purposes.

Secondly, social media platforms have become a tool for cyberbullying. Cyberbullying is a type of digital harassment that involves using social media platforms to intimidate, humiliate or embarrass an individual. With the lack of privacy protection policies, cyberbullying is widespread and has become a significant problem for many users. Therefore, stronger privacy protection policies could help limit the amount of harassment that takes place online.

Lastly, stronger privacy protection policies would increase user trust in social media platforms. If users know their data is being collected and used ethically, they are more likely to engage with the platform. This engagement will lead to the increased value of the platform and create a safer environment for all users.

In conclusion, the rise of social media has led to an increase in the sharing of personal information. As a student in grade 9, I support stricter privacy protection policies on social media platforms. These policies will help prevent data misuse, limit cyber-bullying, and increase users' trust in the platform.

E1920CC1D734,"A debate has been raging for years over whether or not young students should commit to a career while in school. Supporters of committing to a career at an early age argue that it allows students to focus on their chosen field of study and gain valuable experience, while opponents worry that it leads to students missing out on important experiences and opportunities.

On one hand, making the decision to commit to a specific career at a young age can be beneficial. It allows students to access mentorships and internships that can help them gain valuable learning experiences and industry connections. It also helps them stay focused on their studies and avoid the risk of getting sidetracked. Making a commitment also allows students to make a more informed career choice, as they gain experience in their field prior to entering the job market.

On the other hand, committing to a career at a young age can be a risky move. Young students may not be aware of all the career paths available to them and may make a decision not best suited to their talents or interests. Additionally, committing to one field can limit the range of opportunities and experiences students can explore. Finally, young students may not have the maturity or experience needed to make an informed career choice.

In conclusion, while committing to a career at a young age can be beneficial in some ways, there is also a risk of missing out on important experiences and opportunity. Therefore, it is important for students to do their research and carefully consider all the pros and cons of committing to a career at a young age.",1,0.99453,1,True
BB0157B70CA5,"Hey, so like, I was thinking about this whole after-school homework club thing, and I have some pretty strong feelings about it. I mean, on one hand, it's like super helpful to have a place to go and get your homework done after school, especially if you don't have a quiet space at home or if you're just really struggling with a particular assignment. It's like, you can get all your work done and then you don't have to worry about it at night, you know? Plus, it's like, a chance to hang out with your friends and stuff, which is always cool.

But on the other hand, like, it can be kinda stressful, you know? If you're not careful, you can end up spending way too much time on homework and not enough time doing other stuff, like playing sports or practicing your instrument or whatever. And if you're not good at time management, you can end up staying at the homework club way later than you're supposed to, which is like, not cool. And sometimes, like, the homework club can be really boring, especially if you're not into the subject you're working on, which is like, totally not fun.

Another thing is, like, what if you don't need help with your homework? Like, what if you're already good at it and you don't need to be at the homework club? That's like, a waste of time, right?

25daf086,"The advantages of limiting car usage are becoming more apparent in many parts of the world. One example is Vauban, a suburb in Germany where car ownership is discouraged. In this community, 70 percent of families do not own cars, and 57 percent of residents actually sold their cars to move there. According to one resident, life without a car has reduced stress and made them happier. This suburban experiment demonstrates the potential benefits of separating suburban life from auto use.

The trend of separating suburbs from car usage is not limited to Germany. It is also being adopted in other parts of Europe, the United States, and the developing world. Planners are aiming to make suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. Stores are being placed within walking distance, rather than in distant malls. Transportation for America, a coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States, is promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. This shift in planning is necessary, as passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions.

The advantages of limiting car usage are not only environmental, but also social and economic. In Paris, a partial driving ban was enforced to clear the air of smog. Congestion in the city decreased by 60 percent, and the smog levels were comparable to those in Beijing, one of the most polluted cities in the world. Delivery companies did suffer some financial losses due to the driving ban, but exceptions were made for specific types of vehicles, such as plug-in cars and hybrids. Public transit was also made free of charge during this period. This example shows that limiting car usage can significantly improve air quality and reduce congestion in cities.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can have a positive impact on the quality of life in cities. In Bogota, Colombia, a car-free day was implemented to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. The program has spread to other countries, and there has been a significant decrease in traffic congestion during the car-free day. The event has also led to the construction of more bicycle paths and parks, improved sidewalks, and the development of new restaurants and shopping districts. This demonstrates that limiting car usage can lead to the creation of more livable cities with better infrastructure and amenities.

There are several factors contributing to the decrease in car usage. One major factor is the shift in behavior among Americans. Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. The number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and has been steadily decreasing since then. This decrease in driving has environmental benefits, as transportation is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions. It is also leading to changes in the car industry, with companies like Ford and Mercedes rebranding themselves as ""mobility"" companies with a broader product range. This shift in behavior is attributed to various factors, including the rise of telecommuting, the renewal of city centers, the availability of car-pooling apps, and the proliferation of car-sharing programs.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages. It can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, decrease congestion, and create more livable cities. The shift towards limiting car usage is not limited to one country but is a global trend. It is important for policymakers, urban planners, and individuals to recognize the benefits of reducing car usage and work towards creating more sustainable and accessible communities.",1,0.98770624,1,True

By separating suburban life from auto use, communities can become more sustainable and environmentally friendly. One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Passenger cars are responsible for a significant percentage of these emissions, and by reducing car usage, we can have a positive impact on the environment. In Europe, cars contribute to 12 percent of these emissions, and the figure can be as high as 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By adopting practices like those in Vauban, where car ownership is allowed but parking is limited, we can encourage people to give up their cars and rely on other forms of transportation, such as walking, biking, or public transit.

In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, limiting car usage can also have other positive effects. It can help reduce traffic congestion, improve air quality, and promote a healthier lifestyle. In Paris, for example, a partial driving ban was enforced to clear the air during days of intense pollution. As a result, congestion in the city decreased by 60 percent. This shows that by limiting car usage, we can create a cleaner and healthier environment for everyone. In Bogota, the implementation of a car-free day has become a popular event, with millions of people choosing to use alternative forms of transportation. This not only reduces traffic congestion but also encourages people to engage in physical activity, like hiking, biking, or skating, which leads to a healthier lifestyle.

Moreover, limiting car usage can also have economic benefits. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can save money on infrastructure costs, like building and maintaining roads and parking spaces. Additionally, by promoting alternative modes of transportation, we can support businesses located closer to residential areas, as seen in the example of Vauban, where stores are placed within walking distance of homes. This can lead to the development of more compact and accessible communities, with less space allocated for parking and more space for amenities and public transportation.

Overall, there are numerous advantages to limiting car usage. It can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, decrease traffic congestion, improve air quality, promote a healthier lifestyle, and have economic benefits.

It is the foundation of a successful life and has the power to shape our experiences and opportunities. In this essay, I will argue that having a positive attitude is crucial for achieving success in life and provide evidence to support my claim.

Firstly, a positive attitude allows us to approach challenges with a growth mindset. When we have a positive attitude, we believe that we can overcome obstacles and improve our skills through hard work and dedication. This mindset allows us to take risks and embrace new opportunities, which can lead to greater success. For example, a student with a positive attitude may be more likely to try a new subject or take on a challenging project, which can lead to academic success.

Secondly, a positive attitude can improve our mental and physical health. Research has shown that people with a positive attitude tend to have better overall health and are less likely to experience stress and anxiety. When we are feeling positive, we are more likely to engage in healthy habits such as exercise and proper nutrition, which can lead to physical health benefits. Additionally, a positive attitude can improve our mood and outlook on life, which can have a positive impact on our mental health.

Finally, a positive attitude can improve our relationships with others. When we have a positive attitude, we are more likely to be approachable and empathetic towards others. This can lead to stronger connections and more meaningful relationships. Additionally, people with a positive attitude are more likely to be seen as trustworthy and reliable, which can lead to greater opportunities for collaboration and success.

In conclusion, having a positive attitude is crucial for achieving success in life. It allows us to approach challenges with a growth mindset, improves our mental and physical health, and improves our relationships with others.

llama_70b_v11042,"Hey there! So, like, when people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person, right? And that's actually a really smart thing to do! See, getting multiple opinions can help someone make a way better choice for a couple of reasons.

First off, when you only talk to one person, you're only getting their perspective. And that perspective might be, like, really narrow or biased or something. Like, imagine you're trying to decide which movie to watch with your friends, and you only ask your BFF for advice. They might just tell you to watch the rom-com they love, even though you're not really into that genre. But if you ask, like, three or four other friends, you might get a better idea of what's actually good and what's not.

Another reason why seeking multiple opinions is helpful is that it can help you avoid, like, confirmation bias. That's when you only listen to people who agree with you, and you end up making a decision that's not actually that great. Like, if you're trying to decide whether or not to try out for the school play, and you only ask your drama-club friends, they're probably all gonna be like, ""Yaaas, you should totally audition!"" But if you ask, like, someone who's not really into drama, they might be like, ""Uh, have you thought about how much time it takes up? Maybe you shouldn't do it."" And that's a good point!

Also, getting multiple opinions can help you, like, think outside the box, you know? When you only talk to one person, you might just get, like, their idea of what's good, and that's it. But if you talk to, like, five people, you might get five totally different perspectives, and that can help you come up with a way better solution. Like, if you're trying to decide how to decorate your room, and you ask your friends for advice, one person might suggest, like, a cool mural, and another person might suggest some sick succulents, and someone else might be like, ""You should totally get a neon light!"" And then you can be like, ""Oh, I never thought of that!"" and you can come up with a way better plan than if you just talked to one person.

So yeah, seeking multiple opinions can be, like, really super helpful when you're trying to make a decision. It can help you avoid bias, think outside the box, and just generally make a better choice. Just don't forget to, like, actually consider all the opinions you get, and don't just go with the one that's, like, the most popular or whatever. That's not how it works!",1,0.99434257,1,True

In today's world, students of all ages are constantly interacting with each other in various settings, whether it be in the classroom, on the playground, or even online. However, it is important to create a program where older and younger students can interact in an educational setting, where both age groups can learn from each other and help each other out. This type of program is important for students to participate in, as it provides a unique opportunity for students to develop important skills and knowledge that can benefit them throughout their lives.

Benefits of Intergenerational Learning:

Intergenerational learning is the process of learning from and with people of different ages. It has been shown to have numerous benefits for both older and younger students. For older students, intergenerational learning can provide a sense of purpose and fulfillment, as they can share their knowledge and experiences with younger students. This can also help older students to stay mentally sharp and active, as they engage in new and challenging learning experiences.

For younger students, intergenerational learning can provide a valuable opportunity to learn from and with older students. Younger students can benefit from the wisdom and experience of older students, as well as the perspective and insights that come with having lived through different times and events. This can help younger students to develop a more well-rounded understanding of the world and to better prepare them for the future.

In addition to the benefits for the students themselves, intergenerational learning can also have positive effects on the school community as a whole. By creating a program where older and younger students can interact in an educational setting, schools can foster a sense of community and collaboration, and help to bridge the gap between different age groups.

Grades that should benefit from this type of program:

While intergenerational learning can be beneficial for students of all ages, there are certain grades that may benefit more from this type of program. For example, younger students in grades K-2 may benefit from the opportunity to learn from and with older students who can provide them with a more structured and organized learning environment. Older students in grades 6-8 may also benefit from this type of program, as they can share their knowledge and experiences with younger students and help to mentor and guide them through the challenges of middle school.

On one hand, it can lead to academic and financial success, as well as personal growth. On the other hand, it can also limit opportunities and lead to a lack of flexibility in one's career path.

One of the main benefits of committing to a career at a young age is that it can lead to academic success. When students have a clear idea of what they want to pursue, they are more likely to work hard and excel in their studies. This can lead to better grades, scholarships, and opportunities for further education. Additionally, by committing to a career, students can focus their studies on the specific skills and knowledge needed for that career, which can help them stand out in the job market.

Another benefit of committing to a career at a young age is that it can lead to financial stability. By starting a career early, students can gain experience and build a reputation in their field, which can lead to higher salaries and better job opportunities. Additionally, by starting a career early, students can also begin saving for retirement and other long-term financial goals.

However, there are also some disadvantages to committing to a career at a young age. One of the main challenges is that it can limit opportunities for personal growth. When students commit to a career at a young age, they may not have the chance to explore other interests or try new things. This can lead to a lack of flexibility in their career path and a feeling of being stuck in a job that may not be fulfilling.

Another disadvantage of committing to a career at a young age is that it can lead to financial instability.

For example, online communities like Reddit and Tumblr have provided a safe space for people to discuss their interests and share their opinions without fear of judgment.

However, there are also potential negative impacts of technology on human contact. One of the main concerns is that technology has led to a decline in face-to-face interactions. As people become more reliant on technology to communicate, they may become less comfortable with in-person interactions. This can lead to a lack of social skills and difficulty forming meaningful relationships. Additionally, technology can be used to spread misinformation and fake news, which can lead to confusion and mistrust among people.

To prevent these negative impacts, it is important for individuals to be mindful of their use of technology. This means setting boundaries and limiting the amount of time spent on technology. It is also important for people to fact-check information before sharing it online and to be cautious of the information they are consuming. Finally, it is important for society as a whole to prioritize face-to-face interactions and to encourage people to engage in these interactions.

In conclusion, technology has had a significant impact on human contact in the 20th century. While it has brought many benefits, it has also led to some negative consequences. To prevent these negative impacts, it is important for individuals to be mindful of their use of technology and for society as a whole to prioritize face-to-face interactions. By doing so, we can ensure that technology continues to bring people together and enables them to connect in meaningful ways.",1,0.9946116,1,True
CE11907D971D,"Technology has had a dramatic effect on people's lives in modern society. We've gone from not being able to communicate with someone on the other side of the world to being able to send messages and stay in contact with anyone instantly. It's undoubtedly changed the way we communicate and interact with one another and it's made our lives much easier in many ways.

On one hand, technology has made it easier to connect with people from all walks of life. Social media has made it possible for us to find out more about each other, make connections with new people and even to stay in touch with family and friends who may be separated by vast distances.

On the other hand, however, technology has made it easier for us to overestimate the size and strength of our human connections. We often use technology as a crutch to maintain contact with someone but don't truly make an effort to form a meaningful relationship with another person that extends beyond the superficial. In some cases, technology has replaced real human contact and this can lead to a lack of meaningful relationships which is certainly not beneficial for anyone.

Overall, technology has had a huge effect on how humans interact. It's undeniable that it has connected us more than ever before and made communicating much easier. However, it is important to remember that technology should not replace real-life human contact and interactions and that it should be used in moderation to maintain healthy human relationships.",1,0.9944851,1,True

81218F777A2F,"Conserving energy is one of the most important elements of sustainability and resource conservation. It is important to conserve energy both financially and ecologically — environmentally-friendly energy conservation can lead to economic and environmental benefits, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and saving money on energy bills. Additionally, conserving energy can help to reduce reliance on natural resources like paper, such as in an academic setting. Teachers can encourage students to move away from traditional paper-based learning activities and use digital applications instead. There are also many ways individuals can help conserve energy in everyday life, such as turning off lights when leaving a room, washing clothes in cold water, buying products with the Energy Star label, and recycling. By conserving energy, we can reduce our carbon footprint, help protect the environment, and make significant cost savings.",1,0.9938444,1,True
6E70CECCE25D,"Extending the school day by two hours could potentially provide students with a number of benefits. With additional time, students could benefit from smaller class sizes, less competition for resources and access to more subjects. Furthermore, by allowing students to have more time for projects and assignments, they may improve their academic knowledge and skills. Studies show that longer school days can provide students with more time for socializing, which can have positive effects on physical and mental health. 

However, extending the school day by two hours could have potential negatives as well. This could lead to an increase in stress levels since students will have less time for rest and leisure activities. Furthermore, without adequate compensation, teachers may struggle to accommodate the extra burden, leading to poorer overall educational standards. Additionally, there could be drawbacks to the community. A longer school day may mean that fewer people are available to work, as well as decrease job availability for those providing after school activities for children. 

In conclusion, while there are potential benefits for students in extending the school day by two hours, there are also possible drawbacks for teachers, students, and the community. Ultimately, a decision should be made carefully, and include taking into consideration things like potential physical and mental health effects, educational benefits and potential community impacts.",1,0.99453557,1,True

So, technology.  It's like, everywhere.  And it's definitely had a big impact on our lives.  Both good and bad, you know?

First, the good stuff.  Technology has made life so much easier in so many ways. Like, think about it. We can communicate with people all over the world in seconds.  That's crazy! And with all the apps and social media, it's like, we're never really alone.  Even when we're alone, we're still connected to the world. 

But,  there are also some pretty negative effects.  Like, have you seen how much time people spend on their phones?  It's like, they're not even present in the moment anymore.  And it's not just them.  We're all doing it.  It's like, we're all so addicted to our screens. 

And it's not just the screen time either.  Think about all the privacy issues.  Like, our personal information is out there for everyone to see.  And it's not just that.  There's cyberbullying and online harassment.  It's like, the internet can be a really mean place. 

But,  there are also some really cool ways technology is changing things.  Like, have you heard of virtual reality?  It's like, you can experience things that are completely immersive.  And it's not just for gaming.  There are so many educational and therapeutic uses for it too. 

So,  yeah. Technology.  It's like, it's both good and bad. *smirks",1,0.9945635,1,True
