Policy 1 is better because that way students will be allowed to bring cell phones but will have to focus in class. Then they should be used in lunch breaks so they can take a break from class work. Also its best if they are allowed to bring to school because there can be emergencies and students can call home. Policy 1 is also better because during class time they can be learning and working but when its time for lunch they can use it that way it doesn't have to be only work. They can also have time to call home during break for something they need. Policy number one is also better because only during class it has to be off so they can focus on their work but later on when it is break they can choose to use it. The only time it can be off is during class but that's all, and when it is not class time their cell phones can be on and they will be able to use them without any problem because during class they will turn it off. So policy 1 is really best to use because during class they need to concentrate and do their best and for doing their work they get to use their cell phone after. Policy 2 is not better because students will bring their cell phones because they might need it to call their parents after school or something. So policy 1 is better and easier for students to follow. That way there wont be any problems on whether for students to bring their cell phones or not to school.",0,0.007229864,0,True
A9FEE9B7208B,"What happen on Mars. In May 24, 2001. One of our spacecraft took many photos of a human face that look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. People think that this is a symbol of life. What they dont know is that we have studied this symbol for a long time and there is no symbol of life on Mars.

NASA sent one our space man Michael Malin to take some pictures with a better camera, revealing that their is no sign of alien life on Mars. ""But not everyone was not satified."" In April, 1998 we sent another spacecaft to take pictures of Mars but it was to cloudy witch made it look like an alien markings.

April 8, 2001 cloudless day, we sent another one of our viking spacecarft with a better camera so that we could see what we were really into.

C4008B4496ED,"In 1976, the Viking 1 set course to mars. When the Viking 1 was orbiting mars, the Mars Global Surveyor took a photo of a strange figure. It looked like a shadowy human face. The question everyone is asking is who are what made this? Was it aliens or is it just natural. If you ask me, this strange looking thing is just a natural landform.

I think it is a landform for a couple of reasons. My first reason is that only a few of my friends from NASA believe that this strange landform was really made by aliens. I also think that this is just a landform because the photo that we took was not very clear and that could have made the landform look like a face.

I also think that this is just a land form because the time of year that we took the one of the photos. When we took the photo in 1998, we took the photo during the winter on Mars and it made Mars sort of cloudy and the Mars Global Surveyer had to peer through the wispy clouds to see the strange landform. Some of my friends from NASA were saying that some of the so called ""alien markings"" were hidden too.

My final reason for thinking that this is just a landform is that when we took the thre pictures and compared them, they all looked different from each other. The picture we took in 1976 looked like the face the most out of the three pictures. The picture we took in 1998 did not have the same details of the first picture and it did not look like a face. The picture we took in 2001 did not have the facial features of the first photo either. Therefore, I think this is just a landform

In conclusion, I think this is just a landform because only a few of my friends believed that it was done by aliens, the photo we took in 1998 was different due to some of the factors of weather, and all three photos looked different from one another.      ",0,0.0076080905,0,True

I know you set high standards for us to achieve and you will get those soon, but in the mean time, I believe to participate in sports you should at least have above a D. Don't you Mrs. Principal?

I believe we should support this because some students just cannot get things as fast as others and they just can't admit it, it is embarrassing and they will probably feel they don't have the knowledge and they will just get more depressed. Also they are trying their hardest.

Also if you are so concerned you should just hold an adolescent-to-adolescent tutoring, you know peers teaching each other, because sometimes kids can just explain it in an easier and more comprehendible manner. This has been proven to work in other countries and also bring grades up 45%. I believe this have caught your major attention.

Many kids are not able to participate in these sports because of the new 'school law' you just brought up. I have learned these kids do these sports to blow off steam and also just to not be ticked by anything tiny, like a fly set off their temper. Technically, you have just risen the bullying rate to 76.5%, yep, I just went there...

You need to remove this ""law"" off this campus as fast as you can, ASAP! Change the law to: If you have a D- you will need to stay in after school teen-to-teen tutoring until 3:03.

If you do this just would be doing this whole school a big favor in everyway.

I would love to say thank you and hopefully we would do more friendly adult v. teen in the future.

011495811E41,"Dear Principal:

I believe that cell phones cause problems when students are using them during class for texting, or going on the internet. However, they are very important for a student to have during the day. That is why I think Policy 1: Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time, is the best policy.

The main reason why I think that policy 1 is better is because the students may need their phone if they need some way to communicate with their parents before and after school. The students may need it if they find out their sport's practice is canceled, and they don't have a ride. They may also need to contact someone if there is some sort of emergency and they need help.

However, students may also need their phones during the day as well. My older sister is a freshmen this year, but when she started at high school, she often times got lost so she would call her friends and ask them for help. Another important reason that students should be allowed to have their phones during the day is if they aren't feeling well and they need to come home for the rest of the day, they can call their parents or a friend to come pick them up.

I believe that if a student is taking advantage of there privilege of even having a phone at school, and they are using it for social purposes, it should be taken away. But if a student does get caught, the teacher that confiscated it should return it to the owner after that class period. If a certain teacher is having problems with too many students having their phones out during class time, they should have every student place their phone at the far corner of their desk so the teacher can see everyone's phone and make sure no one is being distracted by them.

If you use policy 2, I believe that students will feel like they have to sneak their phones into class, and that may cause a bigger problem. If students start taking in their phones secretly, more and more of them may get used to it and eventually start taking them out during class and you will end up in the same situation you are in right now. If you end up in this situation again, you will have to make more policies.

Elisabeth Rosenthal writes ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" to show that limiting car usage helps to ""reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes..."" Their goal is to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases being released into our atmosphere because it is destroying Earth. The gases are destroying the ozone layer drastically, and if this continues Earth will be gone. She also wrote ""The End of Car Culture"" explaining that the number of cars bought has reduced, bu in reality it is a good thing because it reduces the amount of pollution in the air, and money could be used on something more productive.

Community service. I think that it should be an option for students to do community service. My reasoning for this is because : not all students will have the time, some students wont do it from the heart, and also this will bring uprisings among the students.

As I stated my first argument for my opinion is not all student will have the time. Making someone do something is not always the best choice because student can be really busy and the you just may not know this. In the shape that the environment is in now most parents have to work therefore there may not be enough time -looking into their schedule. It's not as easy as to just get driving to the destination. That needs time and with time come money. They will have to pay for gas and squeeze something in their schedule that they know won't fit. This is also how stress occurs.

My second reason that I feel community service should be optional is that some students wont do it from the heart. Nowadays a lot of kids feel that is important to impress their friends so they do thing for attention ,hence; the task will never be done from the heart. There are some students who are willing to do this and then there are those one who wouldn't give a ""hoot!"" Well this is why this should be optional and not mandatory. As an example, if I were to go to a party and wanted it clean so I made it mandatory for kids fourteen and up to clean the area then most of them wouldn't do it from the heart, whereas just asking form volunteers you know the job will get done whole-heartedly

My third and final reason why community service should be optional is be cause this will cause uprisings among the students. We all know that once a student is told to do something that they feel is ""stupid"" then this will cause attitudes, arguments, and yelling. No person likes to be around this twenty-four/seven so I would just see it that this was an optional thing.

In conclusion I hope you see why I think that serving people in our community (community service) should be optional. Again I state these reason to express my feeling for this and they are: not all students will have the time, some students wont do it from the heart, and also this will bring uprisings among the students.

Having no cars is a great solution to having no traffic and less polution. Without cars our air would be fresh and it wouldnt take as long to get from place to place.

Although many people have cars and drive them regularly it is not always the best choice. Having no cars would be a drastic change to society but it would also be a major change in the way we travel and breathe in air. In Vauban, Germany the residents have gave up on cars. The streets are car free. ""As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move there"". This piece from the text tells us that hardly any one is driving a car their. One of the residents says ""When I had a car I was always tense. Im much happier this way"" this lets us no that without a car the resident is much happier and is not tense. Car release greenhouse gas emissions from there tailpipes. In the article ""In German suburb, life goes on without cars"" it says that ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"". That is insane to think that much is released, but its happening daily from everyday car users. The environmental agency is trying to promote car reduced communities. Polution got so bad in Paris that they had to enforce a partial driving ban. After enforcing this the texts says "" congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog"". So limiting their drving in Paris reduced the smog. It is not always the best choiceto drive all the time exspecially if you job or social event your going to isn't far. In ""The end of car culture"" it says "" organize your summer jobs and social life around where you can walk or take public  transportation or car-pool"". By doin those things it will reduced smog and gases getting into the air.

By not having any cars it would reduce polution, give us safer air to breathe, and it would be easier to get from place to place with any traffic. Cars release tons of gases and polute the air. WIthout cars it would reduce that problem. With less cars on the road and mostly public transportation it would be easy to get around instead of getting caught up in traffic. So not having cars wouldn't be such a bad thing after all.    ",0,0.0076085622,0,True

I am a student of your school and i want to tell you which policy i think is better.

i think policy number 1 is good because. that's when students get to have free time and so they wont be getting in trouble. also that way students don't have to be taking it out during class and they know that they can wait till they have free time.

To continue i also think it would also be good because. when many kids be taking them out in class they be getting their cell phones taking away. but if you let students take them out during lunch hour they don't have to worry about getting in trouble.

also some parents want their kids to take their cell phones incase for an emergency. and so that students could call their parents incase they forgot something. further on after their free time is over you can take every student to their locker and make sure they don't have their cell phones so they wont use it during class periods.

and my final reason is because if that way students can avoid getting in accidents in school if they are desecrated in the hall ways. that way students can also get caught up in school work. and not be failing classes.

Yes to these questions, then you would agree with the principle who thinks that all students needs to participate in some kind of extracurricular activity. But, I think students do not need to participate in extracurricular activities if they do not want to.

First of all, Some students might have important things that they must complete. For example, Homework, Is something that all students deal with. Here is a scenario, say Generic_Name has a big science project on Newton's third law, he is almost done with it, it is due the next day, but he cannot finish it because he has to go to the student council meeting at 5:00 because his principle requires him to. What should he do? Another example is, Generic_Name is trying to finish his Geometry and Civics/Economics homework, which they are due tomorrow, but he has to go to the school basketball team practice this evening, and he cannot miss it. If students have to do these things, then they might not get things done on time. Do you still say yes to the two questions in the introduction?

Another reason could be, a student, of all the choices available, might not want to do anything because nothing sounds good to them. Like if a student was looking for something to do, and they don't find anything, then they may have to do something they don't want to. Say Generic_Name is trying to find something that he would enjoy, he does not find anything that he wants to do. So the school assigns him something, Soccer, but he does not like soccer and does not have fun doing it. How about now? Do you still think all students need to do extracurricular activities?

Have you ever considered the fact that some students might just want to stay home with their families? Or go somewhere on the weekends? Or just relax on the weekends? Well, if you still say yes to the two questions in the first paragraph/introduction, then consider the fact that some students come home after a long day at school, and they just want to relax, talk to their family about their day, or watch a movie, TV show, etc. Or on the weekends where they just want to stay home, visit their relatives/friends, or go somewhere, like museums, the store, or somewhere they will enjoy it. Here is another scenario, Generic_Name plays on the Baseball team, and there is a championship game coming up, he is very excited for it, and he cannot miss it unless he is sick. But Generic_Name and his family are going to the beach, something Generic_Name has been looking forward to, but the coach schedules the championship game the same day that his family is going to the beach. What should he do now? It's things like this that can interfere with family events that a student might look forward to. Now what do you think? After all the things I have just explained to you, do you still think extracurricular activities should still be required?

OK, if you still say YES to the first question, you might think this.

If you play a sport, wouldn't that be good exercise for you?

Yes, but a student could get great exercise at their house, If they go outside, then they could ride a bike, scooter, skateboard, etc. They could also get great exercise at school to, P.E. they run, play games, sports, etc. going outside and doing PE is a great way to get some exercise.

I think doing an extracurricular activity is something that students do not need to participate in if they do not want to. Do you STILL disagree with me after all that nonsense?

Electoral colleges are a way to see what each of the states want, although some people don't seem to like it. However, I believe it is a good way to see the majorities of the states, which will take account for the majority of the country.

Some people say that electoral colleges aren't a good way to determine which president is good for the country. They say that it's nondemocratic. source 3 However, you are still voting for the person you want. The people are still making a great contribution to the decision. Because in the big picture, your vote really does count. It's a lot better than not being able to contribute at all. Of course things can be better, but the thing is everything can be better in some way. Theres no such thing as something that can't be improved in some way. And there is obviously no way at all that you will be able to please everyone. So I think the electoral college is a good way to average up all the votes.

While there are a lot of variables in this system, it would be difficult to come up with a more solid way. The main complaint is that people think that this system is not a good way to show who the people really want. However, I think this is is not true. You are voting to get the electoral college votes for the president you think will do a better job guiding the country. Your vote truly does count. It adds more chance of the electoral college voting for your side. It shows that all the states are one, and the majority vote shows what side the people of the state want. And that seems like a nice idea to me.

Some of the counter arguments for electoral colleges is that the bigger states get more recognition. And this is true, but isn't that how it should be? Theres more people in the bigger states, so there will be more votes. However, they all count the same, so they don't really get any special advantage. The electoral college is a fair way to really show what the country wants, and some people don't like it, and I think this is a normal occurance.

The electoral college is a good way to show what all of the states want, by putting the majority vote into account to put electoral votes to show what president should be the leader of the country. There are admittedly some problems to it, but I think there would be even more problems with putting it to a popular individual vote.

I think that students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they will make new friends, have something fun to do after school, and they can learn something new. They will have the chance to do something that makes them happy. Something that will let their brain take a break from working so hard during school.

Students will be able to make new friends and meet new people. Before I came to middle school I only knew the people from my elementary school and that was it. Until I joined chorus, I made friends with people that enjoyed music as much as I did. It was so much fun to be around new people and to make new friends. Even though we would have to stay after school to practice for up coming concerts it was still worth it. It gave me something to do after school and I could let my brain take a break from comprehending all the learning tactics that I have come across in school. I got the opportunity to do the one thing that makes me happy almost everyday. If students participate in an extracurricular activity it will give them a chance to open up to new people that may stay with them for a long time in their life.

Students will have something fun to do after school. They would get to enjoy something fun that they may want to continue in their future. It gives them a chance to relax and enjoy the things they love to do outside of school. It will be a more enjoyable experience when they are doing something that really makes them happy. One of my friends loves to play sports and it makes her really happy. She was not worried about homework or getting something done right when she got home. Instead she got the chance to let her mind rest from all the learning and power on the part of her brain that helps her enjoy the sport that she loved. Students will have a better time concentrating on there homework after they have had time to relax by doing extracurricular activities.

Students will have the opportunity to learn something new whether it is a new instrument or a new sport. Every day in school you learn new things in all subjects but it is all surrounded around test and quizzes. But when a student decides to take an extracurricular activity they can learn something that will make them much happier and that does not involve test or quizzes. When I was in fourth grade I decided to start playing the violin. I understood that it was a big responsibility taking on something outside of school but it was worth it. I have always loved playing the violin and I continue to play it now. Also I had to stay after school multiple times to practice with everyone in the orchestra. I learned how to make my brain stronger by doing something that was at a different level of difficulty in a different way.

In conclusion, I think that student should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they will make new friends, have something fun to do after school, and they can learn something new. Students might discover something new about themselves that they did not know before they decided to take and extracurricular activity. Students should not have to work so much and not have any time to themselves. Everyone needs time to relax and do the things they love. By relaxing they give their brain a break to recharge and get ready for all the work that will come in the future.",0,0.00764962,0,True

What if it's an emergency? Some will argue about this, but if it's truly an emergency you can always pull over somewhere and fix the problem. Because you don't want to be driving and someone calls or texts you and tells you"" your house is on fire"".

You want to be able to think about the next step instead of trying to drive and text/call.

4ADD5B2B4FF8,"Dear Principal,

As a member of the student body, I would like to talk to you and express my feelings on you changing the policy to participate in sports or other activities to having a grade B average. Many of our student have a C average, and changing the policy would mean that they wouldn't be allowed to participate in sports or other activities. I think this policy would be unfair. Not only would we have smaller participation in sports activities, but also in school activities. Our sport's teams would fall in numbers and our school functions would be lame and boring, because attendance would be down. So why not change the policy to at least a grade C average? I think this would be more fair to all the students. It would push the students below a C average to achieve something more and improve their grade, and the students above a C average to maintain or slightly improve their grade.

Making the requirement a C average to participate in sports and school activities could also help our school to become academically sound. Making it a B average could do the opposite. Students who have C' s and D' s would feel discouraged and just give up there for dropping are school's average grades really low. We don't want this to happen, so instead of making it a B average let's make it a C average! Mr. Principal I sincerely hope you will take into consideration all that I have expressed to you.

Why should we have a electoral college? tyhe answer to that is no theres no piont in having a electoral college.

Accoording to ""Source 2: the indefensble electoral college..."" by Bradford Plumer ""The single best argument against the electoral collage is what we might call the disaster factor."" state legislatures are technically responsible for pivcking electors, and those electors could always defy the will of the people.

Kennedy.(So that a popular vote kennedy would not have actually gone to kennedy.)"" segergationist are liberal or conservative: political phlosophies commonly seen as opposite each other. The electoral college has had mant problems of things happening reliying on the presidental elections.

Perhaps most worying in the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote Plumer said ""In that case, the election would would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president.(The Senate would chose the vice-president.) because each stat casts only on vote, the single representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representative from California, who represent 35 million voters.""which is much more simpler that have a electoral college expecially when they have had many problems in the past with it.

The most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. In source 2 its states ""bececause of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states. alot opf people dont even get to see the ads .

Students join these activities so that they can enjoy themselves in school. Your policy would take away what we students love doing.

These sports help us take our anger out on whatever sport or activity we joined in. Imagine if you do take away our sports students would take their anger out on others or themselves. Sports and activities are a good way for students to relax and concentrate on their life. Students love doing these things to do something other then go home and sleep.

If you dont ask for others for advice sometimes your choice wont be the best for you.

You may have your own opion on a topic. But if you listen to other peoples opions on the topic they might change your prospective because you may have never thought about it in that way.

Paragraph 2 shows a little taste of how dangerous venus is but it is enticing to learn more about the planet itself.

CAE908DEFBB9,"The so called "" Face'' on mars is just a landform that looks like a face. I know this because there are no such thing as aliens, if aliens did exist we would have seen them and known by now, and lastly I know that I is just a landform because it looks like a coincidental landform that looks like an alien.

The first reason that I know it is a landform and not an alien is because aliens do not exist. They are some made up characters found in science fiction books and movies, just like monsters, witches, and ghosts. There has never been actual scientific evidence that proved any of those things to be real. Many crazy people think that they have encountered ghost sightings and other things like demons, zombies, or even something as dumb as slenderman. These things are all fantasies that they make up in their heads and then try to get other foolish people to believe them.

The second reason that I know that it is not an alien is that if aliens and monsters really did exist we would have all known by know. If they were anything like what they are in movies we would all be dead or abducted. In movies people see UFO's and they suddenly are sucked up into a portal and abducted by aliens and used as slaves. If they existed you would think that many people would probably have gone missing after ""UFO"" sightings. Like I said before it is just a bunch of nonsence that people have made up in their head and aren't smart enough to know that it isn't true.

My last reason that I know it isn't an alien is because I know that landforms can often look like things that they really aren't. For example at my uncles house they have a big rock in their back yard that looks a lot like a ground hog. I know that it is not a ground hog, but if I was like the people that thought it was an alien I could make up a bizare story about how in ancient times the ground hog got cursed and then was turned into a rock because the king demanded it to.

See? It just doesn't make much sence.

Sure, the landform looks somewhat like a face in the 1976 picture, but so did the rock in my uncle's back yard. All the thoughts of it being an alien is so made up in their heads. The NASA crew said, ""Nasa's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. An enormous heaad nearly two miles for end to end seemed to be staring at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. First off, the aliens in sci-fi movies aren't nearly two miles long, not even close to that. Secondly where it says that the head seemed to be staring up at them, obviously if you are above it and it's a 2d or 3d shape it's going to appear to be looking at you!

In conclusion there is no way that the so called face on mars is an alien. It's not an alien because aliens don't exist, we would have known by now it aliens really existed, and some landforms are shaped like odd things. Like I said earlier, if aliens really existed we would have encountered them before and seen UFO's that would try to abduct us. This is why there are no such things as aliens, which means the face on mars is just a landform that just so happens to look like a face. ",0,0.007809413,0,True

A way online class is not beneficial, is that the student not good with communicating. From the student being kept away with human contact, it could unleash a shy side to a student. Being shy can also get in the way of getting a job. One may not know how other people are, how they communicate, and how they react. Overall, the student may not know how to act or respond to the situation.

Distance learning could cause the student to not have a easier access to things like kids in public school. Say if you need a book for a subject that you are in, most public schools would give it to you for free. However, if you are home online, you would most likely have to buy an expensive book. Although you could just buy your own materials, public schools usually provide supplies for free.

Lastly, not being in public school could possibly effect one from having less friends. A limited amount of friends can cause you to stay barricaded in your house most of the time. It could also trigger depression, making you feel alone or like you have nobody. One may fade away from their friends because they do not see them often. One of the reasons of being in school is to make friends, so learning online defeats the whole purpose.

Learning at home is not as dependable as in learning in school. Being home schooled can cause unnecessary payments for materials and supplies, while most schools hand out supplies to kids for free. Distance learning could be causing one to stay in its own bubble, or not know how to improve their social skills.

8DF155F94446,"I was in the hallways looking for an after school activity I couldn't find one that I liked or seemed interesting. The principal made it so that everyone has to do an extracurricular activity after school. I disagree with this decision.

I disagree with this decicion because some people just don't get along with others and those activities require them to talk to people they may not like. Some people are shy and get nervous talking to people. Others are rude and don't like people in general, and people don't want to talk to them. Some people just can't make friends because they're funny looking. People like those anime kids probably can't make friends either because they stay hissing at people and having crushes on cartoon charaters. People can be depressed and not want to do anything after school just go home and lay in their bed the rest of the day.

If someone has do to a sport because there is no other activities to do them they won't enjoy what they're doing. Even if they end up liking it they are doing it for fun not because they want to win everygame. Also is it's a sport you are making thwem spent their money on something you forced them to do. They could have used that money for something that they actually need like food or for paying their bills but no you want them to pay for a jersey, shoes, special socks and they didn't even want to do the sport in the first place. Their family could be really struggling to pay the rent and you want them to give you $100 for a jersey.

Some people might not even enjoy being out doors or they might not be in the mood to be doing stuff like that they just want to go home to their dog or to their nice and comfertable bed but no you want them to spend more energy on after school stuff and teachers already complain about how some kids never do their work and thye dotn care what the excuse is. Someone could say ""Sorry I couldn't do my homework my grandpa died yesterday"" and the teacher would say ""that's tough you should have done before he died you had time then didn't you"" and with everyone doing after school activities there is no time for homework because you get home around six or seven then you eat because you must be starving then you take a shower and boom it's time to sleep and you got no homework done.

I disagree with the decision to make everyone have an after school activity becuase not everyone has time or the personality to be hanging out with random people everyday after school. Some people might be depressed and others can't make friends. Not everyone has the money for supplies they need for their activity. That's why not everybody should be in an extracurricular activity.",0,0.0073652496,0,True
ED0C40B8C17A,"Dear Principal,

Students should not be required to do community service work. Community service is often referred to as ""volunteer work"", key word being volunteer, meaning that it is voluntary, and people can choose whether to do so or not. I think that community service should be strongly encouraged, but not required.

Students have quite a lot of work, and are very busy. Not only with school but also that many have after school activities that also take up much time. Some may not have time to do anything else. Community service is very important, but cannot be done if one does not have the time to do it. Students may become overwhelmed with all their activities and not do as well in some areas. You do not want to commit to too many things, more than you handle, because it can negatively affect things such as schoolwork. Students can be very busy, and having one more thing to worry about in their schedule can be overwhelming, which is why although community service should strongly be encouraged, it should not be mandatory.

Although students should not be required to do community service, it should be very strongly encouraged. Most students will likely decide to do community service even if not mandatory, because they would want to give back to the community and help others. So even if community service is not made a requirement, most will likely still do something to give back to their community.

In summary, students should not be required to do community service because of conflicting, and busy schedules. Although it should not be required, community service should strongly be encouraged because it not only helps the community, but can be a very helpful experience in life. Community service is very important, although should not be mandatory.",0,0.007456598,0,True

086620C2E4FD,"Are driverless cars really necessary? Most of us know how to drive already so why have a computer do it for us. I personally don't see a need for these kind of cars. As of now they still need a driver behind the wheel so whats the difference?

My main point for not wanting these cars around is the fact that they're most likely going to be very expensive. There are cars that are labeled ""luxury"" that go for hundreds of thousands of dollars and whose to say that these cars won't be up there with them. All the technology and all of the research that goes into these will come with a pretty large price tag. If it does have a large price tag on it then it will only reach the elite as most luxury cars do now. Most Americans today don't have enough money to buy an everyday car. Only the famous, wealthy population will get to own this car.

How will this car affect others? If this car is affordable to most of the population and most people get one, will we still need to go to a Drivers Education class? The answer will be yes. Since these cars are not yet fully able to drive themselves, you will still have to take some kind of course to learn how to drive these cars. Now the course will change drastically. There might even be a different course made so people could take a course on how to manually drive and a course to learn how to ""drive"" in an autonomous car. There will most likely be new rules on how to stay safe behind the wheel of a car that can almost drive on its own.

When, and if, these cars become mass manufactured, we might be in for some law changes. New laws on handling these cars, new laws about where and when you can drive and even age limitations. I think with these cars the government is going to make us get a special licence to operate these cars. I would think this licence would be available to people 18 and over who have had 2+ years of driving experience and have taken a course to learn all they can about controlling these cars. This way if they do encounter a rough patch where they had to take control, they would be prepared and know how to take control.

Lastly, are these cars in any way better than manually driving a car?

Cell phone laws won't change so what's the need to have your car drive for you? You would still have to keep your eyes on the road to be prepared for taking control when needed. They are almost synonymous with cruise control. You don't have to keep your foot on the gas but when a stop light, turn or some other action arises that you can't stay at the same speed for, you have to cancel the cruise control and put your foot back on the gas.

What if you just so happen to not be ready to take control? GM has created a seat the vibrates when drivers need to take control. I think something more alerting would be needed so people would know it's an emergency and they need to pay attention.

In conclusion, i think these cars are a waste of time. We should just stick to driving by ourselves so we know whose to blame and don't have to file lengthy lawsuits to see if the company's responsible or not. It would just be another unecessary hazard on the road that no one is ready for.",0,0.008768302,0,True

I am for policy 1, because of many reasons. Policy 1 does state that cell phones can be used during free-time and lunch periods, cell phones are a handy when you need to communicate with someone, and cell phones are really handy incase of an emergency.

This policy does state that cell phones are only to be used during lunch times and free periods.

Our lunch time is not during class time, meaning this policy does not interrupt teachers or distract us from our education. After all, cell phones are supposed to be turned off in class; so we can't use them to cheat, or be distracted by them.

Cell phones are really handy when you need them to contact someone.

Like if you leave something at home(like a project or a homework assignment), you can call a parent during free-time and tell them to bring it.

You can also like call someone if you need tutoring, or if you just need something from a friend, like notes or the homework from a certain class.

Cell phones are also handy during an emergency.

Like if something were to go down at the school(like a fire, a lockdown, or an earthquake), you'd be able to tell your parents that you're okay and nothing happened to you.

7C2A866E5F84,"Cars are a very, very common mode of transportation used all over the world. People depend on cars to get them from place to place every single day. While driving cars seem to be the quickest and easiest form of transportation, there are negative sides to it. These negative effects can be harmful to the environment and humans if we aren't careful. Therefore, citizens should take a step forwards limiting their car usage. The advantages of limiting car usage is that it reduces smog, saves resources, and is a healthier lifestyle.

When cars are used, they can pollute the air with harmful chemicals and toxins. Air pollution is a serious issue that is occuring around the globe. This is important because cars are polluting the air we need in order to survive. Some cities around the world have gotten so polluted that they had to restrict people from using cars over a period of time to try and cleanse the air. If you drove during the ban, then you would recieve a fine. Paris and Bogata are two cities that particitpated in the ban. After the pollution cleared up some, the ban was lifted in both cities. Therefore, reducing the air pollution is a major advantage to not using your car as much.

Over time, cars can use up a lot of resources. Cars run on gasoline, which is a fossil fuel. There is only so much of it and once it's gone, it's gone. Our fossil fuels are being used up quick, so it's time to start saving them. You can save resources by driving around less. Instead of driving yourself, you could either walk, ride a bicycle, skate, ride a bus, or car-pool with some friends. These are all ways you could help save the planet's resources.

Lastly, limiting how much you drive your car can be beneficial because it is a healthier lifestyle for you. You could get more excerise and help the environment at the same time. One community in Germany, named Vauban, gave up their cars completely. They are in a movement called ""smart planning."" This community gets around by walking or riding bicycles. Their lifestyle includes having stores and markets a walk away so they have easier access to them. Having a healthier lifestyle is an advantage because it's important to take care of yourself.

The advantages of limiting car usage is that it reduces smog, saves resources, and is a healthier lifestyle. Driving less reduces smog because it helps clean the air from toxins. It also helps save the limited amount of fossil fuels that we have. Not to mention, driving your car less will give you a chance to live a healthier lifestyle because you will get much more excercise. Overall, driving less is beneficial to both humans and the environment. Therefore, join the movement and limit your car usage.    ",0,0.00670358,0,True

05BA34E2D72A,"With the years of technology advancement, Online and video classes have slowly become a popular alternative for those who prefer to not attend school in person. Many believe that those individuals that don't have a big enough income, or those who like learning in a sole person environment would benefit greatly from taking these classes, while others prefer to stick with the traditional way of learning which is sticking with regular traditional classes. Both sides have good benefits, but traditional classes overtake online classes by a big long shot.

The option to take classes online hasn't always been available. The access to mobile devices, computer, and wi-fi didn't exist at one point in time. Going back thirty years; The option to attend classes from your phone or computer wasn't a thing. Every single student that attended school had to take classes in person, which forced them to adapt to a classroom environment. The big plethora of benefits that you receive from taking regular classes ranges very far and wide, but there are only a few that should be acknowledged. These include a hands on experience, more valid information intake, support from your classmates, and it prepares you for the introduction of your future job.

Hands on learning is the number one factor that differs online classes from regular classes. Having a professional in subjects like math in your vicinity at all times is the best way for a student to get a good grasp on information. Whether it be a professor or a student; The help and guidance of another mind will always have a more significant stretch over trying to learn a subject or topic by yourself. Taking online classes will have some guidance; However, if you're stuck on your work and your not in a video call with your professor, then how are you supposed to get the answer, and looking on the internet for the answer is not the most trustworthy thing to do.

Classmates have such a huge impact because they'll be the next best thing to a professor when it comes to helping you learn. You might not understand the information, but chances are that one of your classmates fully understands it, and they will help you understand the concept most of the time. In certain situations; One might take online courses because their income cannot support them, which is totally understandable, but the circumstances of the benefits from taking online or traditional classes still apply. Being in a classroom when taking classes for your career are vital. Most businesses don't allow you to take online classes. They require you to have a certain number of hours in a certain class, and an internship on top of that.

There will always be the few that counterclaim that online classes are so much better than regular classes, and they might even go as far as claiming that they're a blessing in disguise; However, those individuals tend to throw off the potential downfalls and only look at the few benefits that exist. I agree with most of the benefits like the independent work environment, the accessibility of class from home, and the exception of taking these classes because of financial reasons, but online class students are yet and still cheating themselves out of the large mass of benefits that regular classes offer. To get the most promising outcome; Sticking with traditional classes is the way to go .",0,0.0070687234,0,True

We humans have are cell phones on the daily even in a car while driving. I feel like we should not have are cell phones while driving because it increases the risk of you crashing, puts the people around you in danger and it makes your reaction time slower.

Driving with a cell phone in your hand increases the risk of you having a car accident. In 2015, six hundred and sixty thousand drivers in the United States were estimated to use cell phones each day while driving behind the wheel during daylight hours. Drivers who text while behind the wheel, are twenty-three times more likely to have an automobile crash. The yearly car accidents that happen every year is 1.6 million cars a year.

Not only does texting and driving puts your own life at risk, but it also gravely endangers the lives of other people around you. As a driver, you are responsible not only for the passengers in your car, but also for other motorists on the road, not to mention pedestrians who often end up hurt or killed because of the negligence of drivers.

Using your cell phone while driving dramatically slows down your reaction time. Shown in a study texting while driving delays reaction times by 37%, while drinking to the legal limit delays reaction times by 13%. Making driving with a cell phone more dangerous than driving under the influence of alcohol.

In conclusion driving with a cell phone is a really bad idea it increases the chance of you crashing, putting others around you in danger and slows your reaction time.                    ",0,0.0069621895,0,True
4BB688100D15,"Imagine you receiving advice from someone, but you go ask other people because you're not sure if it's considerable. What I would do in this situation is to not ask one person for advice, I would go to other people and listen to their opinions. Just by listening to different people's perspective you gain more information to help you find a reliable solution. For me, that is the correct choice because it makes more sense to absorb others advice to find a better choice. I believe everyone has the opportunity to seek others opinions to make a better choice by involving others, being curious, and relying on your peers.

By involving others, you can learn a lot of new things just by including multiple opinions. To involve other people you can start off by asking for their point of view, so they can end up changing your mind about your situation for something better. You could also involve others by using their opinion, and ask different people about that person's perspective, and see which one would lead you to make a final choice. Finally, another way to involve others to seek a better choice is by expressing your own opinion, and talking to another person to observe your opinion. I find these ways better to trust, so you don't have to involve only one person.

Being curious helps you find a better belief about a situation you are not sure of. To be curious you could go up to people for advice, and possibly give them options to see which one has a better meaning. On the other hand, you could be curious by listening to what is important or not, and by asking for examples if you don't quite understand. Asking multiple questions of the person's advice and finding the pro's and con's of the situation is another way of being curious. Being curious is the key to lead you to the right path to find a better choice.

Relying on your peers can help you find a better understanding of their advice. An example of relying on others is to build trust with a variety of people to make sure you know that person will give you a positive result. Another way to rely on your peers is to make sure you know them well enough to ask them for advice, and so that you don't go the opposite way of making a consistent choice. However, relying on your peers will make you feel more confident about their opinions, and consider making the right choice. Relying on others will help you follow success by considering others perspectives.

Overall, I think listening to other people's point of view is the key to help you make a better choice. Using your peers and your surroundings will get you to the right path. To make better choices, and using the opportunity to seek opinions is to involve others, be curious, and rely on your peers to find your solution.

96827105,"Many people in the United States are becoming more and more aware of the advantages of limiting car usage. Many don't find this important or feel uncomfortable adapting new customs but it is very important to limit car usage. Limiting car usage contributes to many factors in cities and can also help the environment.

First of all, limiting car usage contributes to the way cities, towns, or suburbs are. For example The first article ""CarFree Cities"" shows an example of a suburb in Germany where people have given up their cars. This suburb Vauban, Germany, has been a success and even 57 percent of the people living there have sold their cars in order to live there, while 70 percent of vaughn's families do not own cars. A media trainer, Heidrn Walter, said ""When I had a car I was always tense. I', much happier this way,"" and it's not only her that feels this way, many other people in this suburb have experienced and enjoyed the nocarfeeling. Also, this article states that a lowcar suburban life makes suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. This makes living there a lot more easier and comfortable.

Second, limiting car usage helps the environment. According to the first article ""CarFreeCities"" says that ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States"" and that ""emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities."" These two facts show how bad cars are for the environment, and not only that, but also, cars polute the air horribly. For example, in the second article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" said that ""Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" This smog has affected a lot of cities as well and now one of the main goals people have is to promote alternative transportation due to this.

To conclude, there are many advantages of limiting car usage and and not limiting is hurting the world. Everyone should be more considerate of their environment and limit their car usage.",0,0.007548474,0,True

59f4a7cf,"The Electoral College is a method of voting for President and Vice President that was produced by our founding fathers in the articles of the Constitution. The Electoral College has been in use for centuries, but it is time that we disregard it. The Electoral College was a smart idea in the seventeen and eighteen hundreds, but as our country continues to change, it is necessary to change the way that we elect our leaders. The Electoral College has remained untouched and exactly the same for hundreds of years and this has caused it to be extremely outdated. Not only is it far too outdated and complicated to help our voting process, but the Electoral College does not give the voters voice instead, it takes it away from them. The Electoral College also can lead to concerning situations that the country and its people do not want to be put in. For these reasons, I strongly encourage you to make the change and switch to election by popular vote.

The question of whether or not to abolish or keep the Electoral College in tact is a heavily debated one, but it is clear that getting rid of the Electoral College will be highly beneficial to the voters of America. The Electoral College was established hundreds of years ago when our Constitution came about and it created a complicated process to elect the President and Vice President of the United States. Our country is changing day by day, and we certainly have made monumental changes since the Electoral College came to be. According to Bradford Plumer, author of, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong,"" a poll was taken by gallop in the year 2000 that showed that less than just forty percent of Americans support the election system that we have now. This proves that it is time for a change and that the system that we currently have in place has been in place for far too long. The everchanging United States of America is in desperate need of an uptodate election system that fits the current needs of the American people. The Electoral College is not only outdated, but it is also an extremely complex voting method. In an article entitled, ""What Is the Electoral College,"" written by the Office of the Federal Register, it is explained that the Electoral College is a lengthy process that involves the choosing of electors and the issuing of Certificates of Ascertainment after both the people and the electors have voted. The Electoral College does far more harm than good for our country and for this reason especially, I believe that America should begin to elect its Presidents using the popular voting method.

Moreover, the Electoral College should no longer be the voting method of the American people because the people are given no voice with the Electoral College process. In his article, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong,"" Bradford Plumer specifically states that the people themselves do not vote for their desired candidate, but instead, they vote for electors who then vote for the more popular presidential candidate. The people should be the ones who vote for the president because they will be the ones who are governed by the president. The Electoral College gives no voice to the people and is considered by many to be a nondemocratic way of voting and is often referred to anachronism. Today, it is a struggle to encourage people to vote and be present on election day because no one feels like their vote matters. People say that one vote doesn't make a difference and that there is no point in filling out a ballot if it has no real affect on which candidate is chosen. The Electoral College and the process it established is really just confirming these opinions. People do not feel like they are contributing because when it comes down to it, the electoral votes are the deciding votes. The Electoral College only has a little over five hundred electors that are representing the millions of regular people who show up at the polls on election day. In order to make the people feel like their opinions are being voiced and their voice is being heard, and to increase voter turnout on election day, it is imperative that the country switches over to election by popular vote.

Most importantly, using the Electoral College as our voting method can lead to some serious problems. The replacing of electors that oppose the popular vote result is a problem that comes with using the Electoral College. Not only is it not hard to accomplish, but it has happened before. According to Bradford Plumer in his article, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong,"" in the early 1960s, people who favored races being seperated in society were almost able to replace Democratic electors with a new set of electors who supported the opposite party. Also, some corrupt electors who are not pleased with the popular vote will simply vote for whomever they please. Electors clearly have trouble being trusted and there is obviously some extreme dislike for the system we have now. The Electoral College also causes some problems when instances like a tie in the electoral vote come about. In this case, a tie in the Electoral College would be thrown to the House of Representatives, who would then vote for the President. The Electoral College brings about uneccessary problems that could all be avoided if the country converted the way of electing to election by popular vote.

In summation, the Electoral College has been around for hundreds of years, but it is time that the United States makes the change that would improve the way of electing its future Presidents. The Electoral College is outdated and complicated, does not allow the voice of the people to be heard, and leads to uneccessary voting complications. For these reasons, I vehemently feel that we should switch from the Electoral College to election by popular vote.",0,0.007904344,0,True
D281AB06407F,"Have you heard of the Seagoing Cowboys Program? Well, It is a program that you will be able to take care of mules, young cows, and horses that were shipped over seas. You should join because it is helping Europe and Asia take care of animals and supplies.

One reason to join is that you help animals travel from one place to another. You will be helping European and Asian countries recover their animals, food supplies, and more. You will visit many countries helping them recover and saving animal's lives as well. And I was happy with what I was doing.

As I said in the first paragraph you will travel to many places. You will able to have some free time when you are at a country because I got to travel to Crete and see an excavated castle and also marveled at the Panama Canal. It was fun to travel all over the world to help people.

On this trip I learned my way around a few countries and how it feels to help people just because you want to. You might get hurt along the way but at least you are doing what is right. By doing this I was drafted into the military when I turned 18 and when they learned that I was on a cattle-boat trip, they told me to just keep doing that for my service. So as I did I saw how much distruction wars could do. By that I became aware of what people need.

To sum up my thoughts, I think you should join The Seagoing Cowboys Program because you are helping animals and people, you visit many places, and you learn things along the way. And I have exprience of getting hurt during these trips but that should not stop you from helping your world go through horrifying events. So, in future reference I advice you to do what is right no matter what.",0,0.006771588,0,True
A79B40F29DCA,"A positive attitude is the key to success in life because it can lead you to having a good job, being well respected by others, having others look up to you, and you should never give up on yourself. Many people have positive attitudes because it can have a good outcome in the long run and help them in their future. Personally I think that having a good attitude can take you far in life. Remaining positive is really the key to accomplishing your goals.

I used to be the type of person who wouldn't really have a good attitude because I was usually afraid of what people would say or I would fear that they would disrespect me because I wouldn't have my guard up. Over the years I learned to manage a good attitude no matter what the situation may be because you never know what someone may be going through and you wouldn't want to treat them even worse than what they are going through. I used to work at Chipotle and having that job taught me to have patience and also maintain a good attitude towards other people, even if they didn't deserve to be treated good. The reason I said it's taught me to be better is because I experienced a customer who was being really racists, although I didn't want to be respectful and I wanted to lash out I thought to myself that I needed to be the grown person and just try my best to ignore their comments and keep going on with my day because having a negative attitude can result to deeper problems and the outcome wouldn't have been the best. My mom is the person who's always told me to treat others the same way you would like to be treated and ever since i've always kept that in mind and tried my best to remain positive. I try my best to a good role model with positive intentions because I know my younger siblings are looking up to me and I don't want to be the person who fails them.

Most jobs would require for you to have a positive attitude because of the way their industry may work. The reasons why they would want someone who has a good attitude is because they have to interact with people, set an example for future employers, and also to satisfy the customers. If your boss were to see what a good worker you are and they see how you manage certain situations they could even give you a raise because they can see the dedication you have for the job. Although at jobs sometimes it can be hard to remain positive because of the situations some customers or even coworkers put you in but I personally think sometimes as individuals we need to put out pride aside and be the bigger person and resolve the issues or just walk away without adding more problems. For some jobs you really have to face hard obstacles and it could get tiring and you would just want to give up but people should always remember that all the hard work you're doing now will be worth it in the end and they would be able to see their accomplishments.

Finally, I think school is the hardest place to remain positive because it brings so much stress to certain people that they don't know how to cope with it. I personally expierence this because I am not the best in school and sometimes I just ask myself

""what is the point of doing all this?"". I usually tend to give up when my classes get too stressful for me and I end up failing my class, I try my best to think of the good outcome it will bring me but sometimes I just feel like giving up because I don't think I will be someone big in the world and that is the worst mindset someone can have because as humans we all make mistakes but we should always think that we can better ourselves, if we only think negative then our situations may end up worse. The best way for you to remain positive is to remind yourself the reason why you are doing it and to show appreciation to those who never gave up on you even when you gave up on yourself. I think that I need to remain positive so I can prove to those who doubted me wrong and I can show them that I am capable of doing good even without their help because in the end the only person you truly have is yourself. Most importantly, I need to prove to myself that if I continue being positive then I will graduate and I will accomplish my goals all because I had a positive attitude rather than a negative attitude and bringing myself down. As an example right now I don't think I did good on this essay but i'm going to be thinking that I tried my best and if anything I could always try again until I get it right.

In conclusion as individuals we should always remain positive and keep trying our best because in the end it will all be worth it, even if it takes days, months, or even years. I know sometimes all someone does is think negative and it can put them in a really low place in life but they should always know to never give up. Sometimes life can get too stressful and there's no positive thinking involved but I really hope that everyone can think positive in certain situations and that they can continue to live happily and see that every obstacle they went through will be worth it. To be successful in life you have to keep trying until you get it right and you acknowledge those situations and you have the mindset that you can really accomplish thing if you put your mind and attitude first.",0,0.009735714,0,True
A20FCA71F224,"My thoughts on driverless cars are not necessarily against it but I think the world can do without for awhile still, in other words there's no rush to get them out into the public streets. Although it would be very luxurious to have a car the drives itself, the safety issues & tedious appliances still need much work. Google has had driverless cars since 2009 that drove more than half a million miles without crashing but these cars still require human occupation in complicated traffic situations & driveways. I think the smart road system working in hand with the driverless cars would be more efficient but too expensive & requires ""massive"" upgrades to the roads so the idea was disgarded. So being that the smart cars would be driving on the roads we know of now it would need a pretty excessive amount of sensors to mimic the skill of a human behind the wheel. Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors in the left rear wheel, rotating senor on the roof, video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, inertial motion sensor, & the LIDAR on the roof that uses laser beams to project a 3D image of the car's surroundings. This is all so that in can mimic human driving ability as closely as possible & there's still much work to be done. BMW's development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" in 2013 was the 'better way' to go about having 'driverless' cars. This car was designed to drive itself standardly & notify the human driver inside when he or she needs to take over the wheel. Some might argue that having a driverless car that still needs you to drive is pointless so the ideas of in-car entertainment & information systems are going around. The ideas of these cars definitely are revolved around luxury & safety but new traffic laws would have to be made for these automobiles driving themselves because if an accident happens who is to blame? I believe there is still more troubleshooting to be as far as having a driverless car on the streets. Most states have even made it illegal to test computer-driven cars with the exception of California, Nevada, Florida, & the District of Columbia who allow limited use of semi-autonomous cars. After these cars are proved to be safe overall, then they will be introduced into the public streets. ",0,0.008252277,0,True
C441FBD9E199,"Dear TEACHER_NAME:

I think that you should not require all students to complete community service. One reason why is because we do not have time. Another reason why is because we could be focused on our school work. Also there are student that are apart of outside programs. This would really be putting stress on some of the students at SCHOOL_NAME.

First reason students do not have time for community services. Some students really don't have time because they might play sports or have academics to focus on. If you went to practice then you just get out and you have to go do community services that id very tiring. I know because i play three sports and when I get out of practice I just want to go home and rest. Also what if some students have lots of chores to do and you had a long day at school then you'll have to do chores then community service. Now put yourself in our shoes.

Another reason why community service should not be required is because lots of kids should be more focused on school work. I think kids our age are already stressed out on trying to make good grades and if you make this a requirement that'll be really hard. Our grades will start dropping, early drop-outs, and depression. we should be focused on getting prepared for a test the next day or homework getting turned in.

My last reason why is because most students are apart of outside programs. say that you are apart of the church choir and you have practice that is a lot to do community service than go to practice. Or you play sports or even if you have tutoring that's a lot of hard work to do for just a normal 8th grader. You guys should already know how hard it is to already do extra things in one day.

First reason was we would not have time for community service. Another we said that we should be more focused on our school work. also I said that what we have other outside programs we were in that will b e hard work. This will be very stressful on a normal 8th grader sincerely STUDENT_NAME",0,0.0076394873,0,True
E810BA3D54AC,"Drivers should not be using their phones while driving a vehicle. Over years, many people have been in a car accident due to using their phones while driving. Many times people are victims because they were not using their phones, but the other driver was. Some drivers do not think about the consequences, they do not think of other people's life. Using phones while driving can also be a reason a police officer can pull any driver over and give them a ticket. It is not just adults who do this, every year there are new teens driving and many of them may be using their phone while driving right now.

In a texting and driving statistics shows that nearly 390,000 accidents occur due to people texting and driving. In those thousands of accidents there are also some teens who were also in a car accident. Many deaths have happened during those accidents and it all happened just because we as humans seem to be too attached to phones and can not wait any longer to text back or to return a call. When drivers use their phones while driving, they have made a decision to make a distraction to themselves and take their eyes of the road.

In car accidents caused by using the phone while driving,there are also victims who do not use their phones, but end up in a accident. The driver who is using their phone will take their eyes off the road and may be likely to hit another car. Anyone can be a victim, they could just be walking and not notice or think anything bad will happen. Anyone who is driving should never use their phone while driving, they need to think about the consequences. They need to think as if they were the victim, and need to learn that being on their phone is not important.

Police officers will pull any driver over if they see them holding their phone, they will not care if the driver was using it or not. The officers are pulling them over before anything worse happens. If an adult gets pulled over they will receive a ticket from the officer or they may be under arrest if they do not have a license. If a teen gets pull over they will get points taken away from their driving permit and will also get a ticket. If people think about it, sending a text is not worth paying a ticket with the money that you could have bought something for themselves.

Drivers using their phones while driving should think twice if it is worth it or not. They can lose their life and make someone else lose their life. They will also get pulled over and receive a ticket and lose money just for trying to reply to a text. Due to using the phones while driving many people have been in a car accident and many have lost their lives. Drivers should also think about others and how they can affect someone's life. People should know that the text can wait and that they can reply to a text when they have reached their destination.         ",0,0.008230942,0,True

I think that the best Policy you should go with is Policy 1which states ""Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time."" I think this policy is the best behind these three reasons, One i think that if they have there phones in free times like lunch or free periods they can call there parents to tell them that they are ok, and that they are having a good time or that they loved the lunch that there mom made for them. The second reason why i think that they should allow cell phones is that if they need to have there parents come pick them up because they are not felling well they could call them or text them during lunch or free period .If the student left there lunch money at home they could call a relative to come and bring them the money or food from a place they want so they will not have to be hungry. My last reason why i think that there should be phones are that if something happens to the student when they are walking to school they could call there parents for emergency's .Say that if they could not bring there cell phones to school and something where to happen to them on there walk they would have no way to communicate with there parents to tell them what happened or for the police or ambulance to call from there phone . So TEACHER_NAME these are all of the three reasons why i think that phone's should be allowed in school and should only be used for emergency's and at free period's and lunch time when it says they are suppose to use there phone's and not during class texting when the teacher is teaching and the phone goes off during class .

6058BEF565C3,"Not a day goes by that you don't see a car passing by on the street.  Often, we don't think much of it and the effects it has.  Throughout the world there are communities campaigning, trying to lower the usage of motor vehicles.  The citizens in these communities are aware of all the cons that come with driving cars.  There are plenty of benefits to not driving cars everyday such as, lower the amount of air pollution, being inclined and motivated to excercise often, and the money that this act can save.

The number of cars being purchased in America has been dwindling with each year that passes.  If this pattern persists it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment.  This is due to the fact that transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just barely behind the power plants.  At one point in Paris, France, there was an extreme case of congestion which provided the air with more than its fare share of smog.  The city was told to momentarily stop the driving of motor vehicles.  Conjestion went down 60 percent after  five days of intensifying smog.  The smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the world's most polluted cities.  By driving a car less the environment benefits emmecely.

In Vauban, Germany it costs $40,000 to have a place to park your car along with your home.  As a result from that about 70% of the families in Vauban don't even own a car, let alone drive one.  Heidrum Walter notified people saying, ""When I had a car I was always tense.  I'm much happier this way.""  She along with &0% of the citizens walk verdant streets and ride bicycles.  As a result they are getting a measure of excercise more than they would be getting if the drove cars.  When you excersise and sweat, your body releases endorphines which triggers a chemical in your body.  The triggering of that chemical causes you to feel happier which is just what the people of Vauban are.

Some people are very well capable of purchasing a car but don't.  Just that simple

Non act saves them quite a handful of money.  Now, sometimes things like driving a car are necessary, so I'm not saying NEVER drive your car.  However, if in the cases where it isn't necessary you were to walk or ride a bike you would potentially be saving pockets of money because gas isn't being purchased as frequwntly as it would be otherwise.  The reduced amount of car driving even benefits your bank account.

Motor vehicles, such as cars and motorcycles, are not always necessary.  Not utilizing them comes with plenty of benefits.  It reduces the amount of smog and air pollution, it makes you healthier and potentially happier, and lastly it saves you money.  Walk around a little.  Go on a bike ride.  Experience all the beneifts of leaving your car in the garage.

Hi, my name is STUDENT_NAME and I attend your school.

I am in the 8th grade.

My opinion on community service is this! I think that community service is a great thing to do for someone even when you don't have to.

It takes putting others before yourself to do this.

I see it as an act of kindness. It shows that you care about other people and it also shows you using unselfishness!

Doing community service gets people to notice what you are doing even if you don't think that anyone notices. I have been in the position where me and a couple friends went to play with some kids at a park while their parent worked all day and the smiles on there faces puts a smile on mine. I never realized what I was doing for those kids by just hanging out with them.

By the end of the day, I didn't want to leave and neither did all the little kids. We had a blast and doing that made me feel good about myself!

I have also done other community service.

One time we went to the high school and made one-million meals for kids in Africa who are starving today.

Seeing everyone in one big room showing kindness and compassion while making those meals with a smile on their faces gave me chills!!

I think community service should continue because doing something for someone else makes you feel good and you never know what good you are doing for that person.

I believe the Face is a natural landform because scientists believe that the face resembles landforms around the American West. One scientist said that it reminds him of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. Also, the scientist added that its a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face.

Scientists can be wrong sometimes though. However, scientists work on their research really hard, so I believe that they know what are doing and seeing. For example, scientists say that you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, so we can see what the face is, a natural butte or mesa.

In the article, it states that on April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia and snapped a photo ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. The image revealed that the face was just a landform, and no alien monument at all. The monument does look like aliens made it, but this fact just shows that the Face is fake and is actually is indeed a mesa.

This tells you why I believe that the Face is fake and is actually a basic landform. Even though the Face does look like aliens made it, it is more likely that it is a natural land form. These facts prove that the Face is not alien made.",0,0.0075341268,0,True

I know that you're considering to let us students use cell phones during free time, and lunch. In my opinion that is a great idea. I think it's a great idea, because it gives the students what they want in some ways and it helps parents too. Sometimes parents have to contact their children, because maybe they have to walk home or have something very important to do. This would give parents time to contact their children so they can give them that information. I think its also a good idea that once they get to class they have to turn off their phones. Turning off their phones is good because then students can't complain how they can't use their phones during school. Which would be a lie if they said that. It would be a lie because they can use their phones during school, just not in class. They should be turned off in class because we students have to learn. We won't learn if we keep texting in class, because then our grades would start dropping, and parents wouldn't be happy about that. We students have to have our phones, our phones are our life technically. Being able to use them partly during school would make us a lot happier. It wouldn't let us fully use our phones during school, but atleat we do a little bit. Students and even me wouldn't complain about turning them off in class, atleast i know i wouldn't. Also if you just ban phones entirely from the school then students are going to use their phones during class, and as i mentioned before, that wouldn't be good. Letting students use their phones sometimes would be better then never letting them use their phones because then they will sneak around with them.

Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the eledtors where they vote between a President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. The Electoral College has about 538 electors a majority of 270 are electoral votes is required to elect the President by which your state entitled allotment of electors equals the numer of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators. The 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of the Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College.

Cellphones took over meeting personally, calculators took over long divison, and cars took over walking from point A to point B. No one really thought how dependant our world would be on this new-age technologies. Our ancestors certainly didn't have the latest smartphone or a brand new Mercedes in their driveway. So what made our generation so materialistic? The necessity of a brand new car, (or any car for that matter) is slowly diminishing, and more people are getting back to using other forms of transportation. The limiting use of cars is super beneficial to the environment, your family's budget, and can bring better social opportunities.

The use of cars has both positive and negative effects. Car usage has a massive impact on the environment, not just in your community, but worldwide. As we all know, global warming is an international phenomenon that is nipping at our toes. It is (mostly) caused by pollution and the dissolvement of the ozone layer, which protects our atmosphere. Gas emissions from tailpipes cause a great amount of greenhouse gases to disperse. In Europe, ""cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions"" (Elizabeth Rosenthal: Source 1). In the United States, the grenhouse gas emissions are 50% caused by passenger cars (Rosenthal; Source 1). That means everytime you get into your car for a ""cruise"", you are harming our environment. Trapped car emmisions combine with the warm weather layers in the air to form smog, which is greatly affecting the French capital, and Beijing (source 2: Duffer). To help prevent these emissions from getting worse, or causing greater harm to our environment, some cities have started a ""car-free zone"", in which no one is allowed to own cars or use them and even park them in their driveway! (source 1: Rosenthal). By creating or participating in a limiting use of cars you can help preserve our beloved Mother Earth.

Every 16-year old dreams of waking up to their brand-new car waiting for them in the driveway. But demographic studies recently show that ""there has been a large drop in the percentage of 16-39 year olds getting licenses."" (source 4: Rosenthal). This decrease is proof that less and less people are interested in owning cars, and even worse, driving them. This doesn't seem like a bad idea, due to the fact that the limited use of cars can save you and your family a great deal of money. New cars are approximately ranging from $25,000 to $50,000, with a monthly payment of about $350. A gallon of gas usually lasts about a week and a half and costs an average of $40 to fill up. In a month, a typical family spends approximately $400 a month solely on car expenses. By choosing to involove yourself in ""smart planning"", which is the seperation of suburban life from auto use (Source 1: Rosenthal) or by using other means of transportation like public buses, trains, bikes, and the sharing of taxis, your household can save a good amount of money.

In modern families, not only has the over-use of technology/social media taken over the traditional family interaction, but also the over-use of cars. In most households, where the teenager has a vehicle, he/she mobilizes themselves away and out with friends. Everyone ends up in different parts of the town, the mall, a restaurant, or at home. If the use of cars is limited, either in a town like Vauban (Germany), where no one uses cars, or in a city like Bogota (Colombia), where families use multiple seat bicycles to visit parks and spend time together (source 3:Selsky), your family can make up for lost time and completely forget about going off on their own. Not only will the days without cars benefit your family but also your social life! A date to bike-tour the city at night is much more enticing and luring then a plain date to the movies. If you need a car, for any reason, whether it be work, or vacation, rental car services are a much better and cheaper option then using your own car.

The innovative programs like ""Smart Planning"", discussed in

""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars""

, and the ""Day without cars"" celebrated in many Colombian cities like Bogota and Cali, discussed in Andrew Selsky's

""Car-Free Day is Spinning into a Big Hit in Bogota""

can provide a interactive and enjoyable lifestyle without the hassle and stress of cars. Not only will your family's social life benefit but also your household's economy! The limiting use of cars can help you or anyone save money without paying those hefty monthly bills, as implied in Source 4:

""The End of Car Culture""

. Last but certainly not least, by reducing your car dependancy, you can help protect the environment by stopping the greenhouse gas emissions from your vehicle, as explained in Source 2:

""Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog""

. Overall, the limited use of cars is beneficial in numerous ways, and hopefully will be exercised much more.    ",0,0.008855182,0,True

Some school offers distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way online or video conferenaring. I don't think that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. there for, students would not care about school. First,students would rather quite learning than to do it online. Second, students wouldn't even want to go to school so why would they waste thier time on a cumputer the hole da? Last but not least,they would do whatever they want ot do because there's no one at home to tell them to focus on thier works. Also students won't pay close attention to learn. For example, they would wake up late to learn. students would play games all day. And also, thier grades would go down instead of going up. Students wouldn't be able to make new friends if they stay at home every day. First, students would be lonely because there are no friends at home to play with after done with homework or fininsed learning. Second, they might think that thier phone and TV would keep the busing but sometimes you find them boring too because you do the same things on your phone over and over again. such as watching TV, posting pictures, commenting and your friends post, texting all your friends, making phone calls and etc. we all like phones i do to, but sometimes we get tierd of them and jut wonder what should i do now? well i will tell you, you should go out and make some new friends and have fun with your life because life is like an uncooked egg if it fells down and breaks you can't put it back together again. also life is shot enjoy it while you still can.

I think we should keep the average to play sports at a c average because a c is still a passing grade and if they have a passing grade they should be eligible to play any sport or be involved in any activities they want to be in. A lot of kids have a c average and sports may be a big part of their life taking that away from them could hurt their grade even more because playing a sport is something they look forward to. i think kids need to be involved in activities. So please do not try to change the grade to play sports to a c. I know that if a kid wants to play a sport it will make him and or her bring up their grade but it may also hurt them too. If a senior is playing basketball and they have a c average and they have a scholar ship to a good collage for basketball and you change the grave average to a b they would probably get the scholarship taken away and if I were them I would cry. Sports can change some poor persons life that didn't have a good house to live in and didn't have the best grades. Making a change in the school policy when kids have already adjusted to them would be horrible. Just like if we changed the law for driving to seven-teen and you were six-teen you would be very mad because driving may be something you love to do and you wouldn't want that taken away so why do that to us?

Thanks so please do not change it or else you may not have a good football basketball cheerleader or any other team.",0,0.008022391,0,True
44B191F560B4,"Driverless cars should be developed and used. There are many ways that driverless cars could help us. Safety is a main concern but many accidents occur due to the driver being disctracted or someone else's fault.

Driverless cars will have sensors to stay on a certain course and not get off track. The sensors could also detect if something is too risky such as backing up in a parking lot. When a time like that occurs the driver must drive the car until the car can handle the situation.

Many accidents occur due people using a celluar device and losing track of where they are. In a driverless car this could be prevented because the driver is not driving the vehicle. They could use their phones but they must know when the car cannot be piloted in a sticky situation. A driverless car could also be used as a taxi driver for those that drink and drive. Driverless cars can also help semi truck drivers that drive around for hours and hours.

Advanced computer systems could be put in the driverless cars to prevent enviromental issues on the road. The systems could also prevent possible rollovers and sliding off the road. It will be very costly but we can save many lives and prevent many accidents from occuring.

I think that you should consider changing the average grade for a student to be able to play sports because most students in this school have a grade c average not b. Another reason why I think you should consider changing the average grade for a student to be able to play sports is because a lot of people would like to play the sport they like to play and be able to enjoy that time of their day. Another reason why I think this is because sports are a good way for kids to eczersize and when kids don't get the eczersize they need they will become unhealthy. Another reason why I think this is because when you have a team sport you need enough people to play in the team sport. For example for baseball you need atleast nine people on the field an if their are only eight the students that want to play that sport will not be able to so that is like a punishment to the people with a grade b average.",0,0.007954398,0,True

The use of cell phones while operating a vehicle should not be allowed. Today in society people do not realize how much cellphones have affected the way people drive. It is and it has been a danger for a while now. There are many dangers due to the use of cell phones most people do not realize that they really are.

To begin with, the majority of car accidents that happen everyday are usually caused by people who are using their cell phones while driving. They tend to use their cell phone while being on the road thinking they can multitask when in reality they can't. People do not realize the kind of accident they can cause by replying back to a text or just reading one. That one simple reply can take someone else's life in a blink of an eye. Once it happens there is no going back, it's not like a message where you can delete or go back to that one specific text.

In fact, using your cell phone is a bad choice to do while driving on the road. There are people with kids in their car trying to get back home or on their way to spend time with some family. Most of these people do not make it back home or to their destination due to either a car accident caused by people who are distracted on their phone. There are children who do not know that a simple phone they use to watch videos on is a bad thing for them. Not only is it a bad thing but it can cause serious outcomes to anybody who is just driving and going on with their life.

To tell the truth, the use of cellphones while driving is illegal in most places. People can get a ticket and get fined for doing so. There are many penalties that people can receive from getting a ticket. For example, some may pay the fine and get demerit points to your license. These demerit points provide a balance and check anyone's driving; they are either added or subtracted from your license. These point vary based on the type of convictions you get. If you go over the number of demerit points based on the type of license you have your license may be suspended. People need to know that you will get a consequence for using your cellphone while driving. It may not seem like a big deal but in the real life it is.

As a final point, the use of any type of cell phone should not be allowed by anyone who is driving. No one really knows the kind of danger cell phones be putting people in. Yes it's a small device almost as big as the size of your hand but it can cause a serious accident. Cell phones may not seem like a big deal to people nowadays but in reality they can be deadly.         ",0,0.007862332,0,True

The bell signals the end of school. You gather your assignment from your teacher, then rush out of the class to meet up with your friends. Laughter and chatter fills the crowded halls. Banners hang from the ceiling advertising the next school event, prom. You find your friends and on your way home, you all gossip about all the newest drama at your school. Yet another successful day of learning and socializing is done. School gives students this opportunity while online classes do not. While students have the opportunity to socialize and improve their education, online classes deprives them of that. Students should not be allowed to take classes online because it hinders their education, and doesn't teach them socialization nor proper discipline.

At school, students have the benefit of meeting with teachers to get additional help. It provides the students with a better understanding of the topic, and a convenient way to meet with teachers. Teachers constantly urge students to meet with them if a student needs help because it is a free and easy way to understand lessons better. Overall, being with the teacher and having the opportunity to meet with them individually improves the students education. However, online school does not give this option to students. Students have their session with the online class, and that's the end of the topic. Teachers cannot give extra help or meet with students one-on-one, which is valuable time students may need. It is a disadvantage to the students and does not give them a proper education.

Additionally, school provides students the opportunity to socialize with other students, as well as teachers and staff. Socialization with other students allows friendships to build, as well as develop important social cues. This is important for the development of kids and young adults into adults who can handle social situations. Furthermore, school gives students the opportunity to interact with adults, such as teachers and principals. This teaches students respect for those in authority positions and how to communicate with people in those positions. This interaction is important for interviews and other situations where they must work respectfully with adults. Online classes deprives students of this socialization. This creates lonely, and antisocial students who don't work well with others. These students taught online miss out on valuable life lessons such as making friends and working with adults. Students need school to allow them to build upon their social lives and learn how to behave in social situations.

Schools not only teach their students academics, but also proper discipline. Students are expected to be at school all day, at a specific time and give teachers their undivided attention. To do this everyday and all day takes discipline, something not required for online classes. Online classes generally take less time, are not every day and can be less work. They are easier. While a student might like that idea and structure of a class, it is not beneficial to them in the end. Discipline is a characteristic needed throughout life. It helps students in their future when they have jobs. Learning everyday on weekdays prepares them for working everyday on weekdays.

Students should go to school rather than taking online classes because school improves their education, allows students to socialize and teaches discipline. Online classes deprives students of valuable life lessons, while school builds character and prepares students for independent adult lives. While it may not be a students favorite place, school provides them with lessons, academic and more, that develops them into successful adults.",0,0.0064892196,0,True

Many students; however, are typically done with the school year before it is even over, they want nothing more than to leave and enjoy their break.

It is difficult for some students to pay attention and do their work in the final weeks of school, so to be sure students will complete their projects, the teacher should not make it themselves.

Summer projects should be designed by students to make sure they are interested, and to make sure they have a say in how much work should go into it.

Students should not be expected to do a lot of work during their summer break.

That is their time off, their time to relax and clear their minds.

The project that they are required to do should not be difficult, and it should not require an unrealistic amount of time and effort to complete it.

They should not have to work for an extended period of time to complete a project that may or may not even be graded.

That is why it should be up to the students to decide what the project is going to be and how much time it should take to complete it.

It is important for the students to come up with their own project ideas so they stay interested when it comes time to work on them.

It could be hard for students to complete a project that was assigned to them that has not peaked their interest.

It goes without saying that if a project is assigned to them by a teacher then it might not be fun or interesting to the student.

There is no way to tell if something will be interesting to someone unless they come up with the idea themselves.

It is a possibility that students will not take the project seriously.

It might not matter regardless of if the project was assigned to them or they came up with the idea.

Students might also think that, since they are on summer break, there is no reason to do the work because they assume that they will not have to turn the project in.

Or they could try to get away with doing the bare minimum so that they can get credit for completing the assignment.

There is no way to force a student to do work, but the chances are that the students that didn't complete the project were not going to do it, even if it was assigned by a teacher.

In conclusion, it should be up to students to design the projects they have to do over summer break so that they are interested, and they know exactly what they have to do.

Students are already expected to do a lot of work during the school year, if they are also expected to do work during summer break it should be something that they choose to work on.

There is a possibility of students not taking the project seriously, but teachers should trust that it is still better for students to decide for themselves what it is their project is going to be.",0,0.007661284,0,True

There could be a potential basketball player that does not know what he is capable of and he could find it through sports. When they work in the yearbook they can find someone who is new to the school and make them feel welcomed. They can find things they never knew that they liked. This can lead to a better school and community.

When a student is forced to do something first they don't like it but then it can lead to many different things in the future. For example, you don't know if you like something until you try it. It is the same way with sports. What if there is a kid that plays basketball for fun but he does not want to try out. Now he can try out and if he really likes it he can furthermore better his skills at it. What if because he had to do the bare minimum of one activity he gets many scholarships in high school and goes to the NBA. Just because of that one activity.

Students have a tuff time fitting in sometimes and it can help by doing extracurricular activities. For example, both students both like taking pictures but they don't think anything of it. They both join the yearbook program which takes pictures of students and faculty. Then they meet and then they become good friends. Just because of that one activity that they had to do. They become a wedding photographers.

Let's say a student wants to become a governor and they see student council and they join it. Now when they join they become president of the school.

This program might make them want to go in depth in their career choice and make them want to join in high school because they enjoyed it so much. Just because they did the bare minimum of one choice. They become the governor of Virginia.

Students may not like being forced to do things. They choose to work for it though. Being asked to participate in one activity may seem cruel or not nice enough.

I feel this way, because using different people's advice, in the same situation at the same exact time, could work better than listening to one person. Also seeing different perspectives from different people can make a person see a situation differently and how they might want to solve it.

First, Using multiple people's advice in unison can work better than just taking one person's advice. Look at different types of sports players. They learn different techniques from a line of coaches, teammates, and trainers to then use everything they've learned from all of these people at the same time. They know more than the average person and this makes them better in that sport. Take Stephen Curry for example, being one of the best guards in the league, he has had to get advice from all of his coaches, trainers etc. Now he uses everything that he has learned to become one of the best point guards in NBA history.

Secondly, seeing different perspectives or opinions from different people can make a person see a situation differently. Seeing how two people may think differently can make the person who is taking the advice see things differently and have another route to go with in their decision. In movies that have ghosts of Christmas spirits, the ghost takes the main characters to see themselves, but from a different view. This makes the main character change their ways. This is how seeing perspectives change the way people think.

In conclusion, advice from multiple people at a time helps a lot, because using different people's advice at the same time can make a person better at whatever they are doing.

First off, people should seek and ask multiple people on advice because you can get clearer information on a topic. For example, I went to a website to search for how to stay calm when your stressed. It didn't give me a clear answer so I searched up another site. This one told me exact steps and procedures on how to calm yourself in a stressful situation. It gave me a better understanding on why looking at multiple sources can give someone better and clearer information. In addition, when my sister needed help at swim practice, she asked multiple people on her swim team how to do a certain stride instead of asking just one person. This helped her see an arrangement of different techniques that gave her different perspectives on how to do the one stride correctly. Later, she went up to her coach and asked her for clarification on how to do the move as well. This helped her choose whether she needed to practice her stride more or just to improve on little alterations. This leads into the next topic on how different view points can help someone make a better choice.

Next, people should seek and ask multiple people on advice because you can see from different view points. For example, I looked at reviews on a product before buying it to see what other people's opinions on the product were. If I were just to have bought the product without reading whether it would work or not, it could result in me losing my money and having a useless product. Seeing other peoples different views and opinions can alter my own opinion and lead me to a better choice in a product to pick from. Additionally, my dad, when he was picking out a cat from a shelter, took into great consideration of the advice the workers gave him on what he needed to take care of a cat and how. However, he also asked around with people in the cat owner community who helped him out as well. The different view points that the shelter and the cat owner community had were vital in the way that gave him the proper tools and techniques to use when taking care of a cat. This leads to the final example on how asking for advice from multiple people can give someone more feedback which helps them in making a choice.

Finally, people should seek and ask multiple people on advice because you can get more feedback. Furthermore, my cousin plays the trumpet at a professional level and most of the time needs feedback on his performances to see how he did. After his shows, he usually asks some audience members how he preformed and if he could improve in someway what could he improve on. It really helps him see what he needs to do better on by asking multiple people, rather than just asking a singular trumpeter in his band. It also helps him decide if he needs to practice more or if he sounded amazing and preformed at the best of his ability. As well as, when I record a video of me playing my instrument I ask more than one person for feedback. I email my band instructor on how I did and on how I can improve for later performances. I then ask my mom and dad on how I did by playing the video for them and ask if they heard that I sounded squeaky, or if I need to redo my video because the sound quality is low as well as other things. The more feedback I have on how I did, the better of chances I have improving my playing skills along the way.

Generic_Name and Generic_Name walk out of the pet store with nothing more than a dog and the essentials for owning one. They both give each other a wide smile and a sigh of relief as they walk home with their new family member. ""Thanks for asking around on how to care for Fluffy,"" who Generic_Name had named. ""It was way better than just asking one person for everything we needed!"" Generic_Name looked at her again with a stern face, ""Now you know the important's of not just asking one person for advice, but for asking multiple people to see their opinions and options on certain topics. Just because they don't have an answer doesn't mean that no one does."" Generic_Name looks at him with a gloomy face and apologizes for her misunderstanding. ""Feedback from others will also help us change and better our understanding on how to take care of our dog."" As they continue to walk home, they both realize that not everyone's advice is good and not everyone is bad. But asking multiple people for help does give you a better understanding than just one straight forward answer. Some people's opinions in some situations won't help you in making a better decision.

BFAE37AAB648,"The option of online classes would be beneficial because it would allow students to be more engaged in the subject, and would decrease the stress and anxiety in their social life. Online classes allow students to have a more flexible schedule thus decreases their stress related to school. The option of online classes don't require class times, students with a schedule of online classes are easily able to make time for other activities in and outside of school. The online classes are a great way to allow students to take responsibility for the classes they take and change their mindset on an environment normally seen as stressful.

One major benefit of online classes is the lack of peers. The lack of other students allows for less distraction when working on assignments and projects. Another benefit of online classes is the environment in which the classes are taken, to most students the word school correlates to a feeling of stress and anxiety. When taking online classes students are in the safe, familiar environment of their home. The benefits of online classes help create better students by allowing them to develop good habits and create a better lifestyle through the lack of distracting peers and the stress free environment of home.

All in all, the option of taking online classes from home is beneficial in more ways than not. The stress free environment in which students take these classes allows students to be more calm and focused compared to environment in which they would experience at school. The focus in which they can achieve is possible because of the lack of peers usually distracting them. Online classes let students achieve their goal in life through; better workplace habits, lifestyle changes, and environment association.

7354F01036AF,"Phones and Driving

In this age of the world almost everyone has a phone of some kind and this includes drivers among us. Phones usually are a little distraction nothing more, but when they are driving that distraction can become deadly. In recent years the fatalities by car wreck have gone up dramatically and usually the reason these days is texting while driving. In most states if you are caught you will have some sentence or a fine of some kind. It doesn't even have to be texting that distracts a person from driving, it can be from kids in the car to the radio.

In the state of georgia there is a pretty new law called the ""hands free law""which tells drivers that they can't even touch their phones while driving. When drivers are not parked even at stoplights if their caught on their phones they will get a fifty dollar fine. The law makers made this in mind to make people not take any selfies or videos or anything like that. In reality people will try even harder and be more reckless to try and do the videos their doing. On the other hand though they say that dash cams are ok to use.

However, there are exceptions to this law such as using stereo bluetooth speakers in the car with spotify. Another exception they make is for directions apps like google maps. They also make exceptions for informing the authorities about a crime or something similar. While they said we can listen to music or streams or stuff like that we can't touch our phones while doing so. Given these reasons i don't think that drivers should be able to use their phones while driving.

I think the second policy is better just because if you have your phone available your really tempted to use it not just during lunch. But the first reason is also good cause there are some kids who would be able to restrain them self as well.

Kids would always try to text during class and on test if they were allowed to use there phone during lunchan . Kids would also start thinking about doing it a lot more sense they no they can bring it to school.

But saying phones aren't allowed would not be fair because of the good kids who use when allowed. The ones who use it after school for rides home or talk to their friends. It just depends on the school and the students.

The principle should ask the teachers to see how many phones they see out or taken away. If the numbers are high than go with the second policy But if the numbers are low then go with the first policy.

9AFAE6562E98,"The purpose of always doing something helps us get different kinds of experiences, it helps us accomplishe what we are doing and gives a purpose to what we want to do in the future. Throughout life, the experiences that you get can help keep you motivated on what you should and shouldn't do as well. In comparsion, when you are inactive you aren't benefiting from anything and you are just not getting enough experience for what you want to do in the long run. This is a major factor on how well you live your life and how you want your life to be. I do suppoort that we accomplish more when we are always doing something and it helps contributes to how we all live our daily lives.

One factor why I believe that this contributes to our daily lives is that, it helps you get an education on something new or just a job that you are interested in. While, going to school and getting an education is a major rule in a human life; it is not for everyone and it all depends on how much effort you put in and if you are willing to put in the effort as well. In many different countries and cities, not all jobs require an education all you have to do is have experience in a certain area or part that makes you want to learn more. This helps decrease inactivity and upbulid activity while you are doing something like helping your community, feeding the homeless, giving advice to young kids. It all just depends on how well you put yourself out there and willing to make a committment about it as well.

A second factor why I believe you feel accomplished by doing something is that, it gives you a purpose in life and a feeling that won't be given again. From my experience of helping kids with their homework afterschool it has always given me always a good feeling and making me proud that I am helping the community. This helped me gain self-satification for myself and let me understand the importance of showing kids at a young age how to be accomplished when you put the energy and time too. Another example I ever felt when doing somethingis when I play lacrosse , and how everytime I don't make my mile time I strive to do better for myself. Lacrosse has helped me put in an understanding on how self-satisfication doesn't come easy it takes time and effort. This benefitted me get motivated for what I should do more and always helping me understand that if I put in my time and energy then there won't be a problem on feeling accomplished. Doing something you love and getting that satisfication helps you serve purpose and feel more accomplished for yourself as well.

One last example of how always staying active can help influence your accomplishment is that you are acknowledging that you are given a purpose to uphold. I do feel like many people don't seriously take the opportunites given and it is very hard to undertake as well. I would certainly always feel accomplished when doing something that can help let others know I care and not just for my own image. I agree that many different factors can influence decision making but also making others understand how important you are to someone as well.

In conclusion, the more work you put in ;the more you are in feeling accomplished and in pleasing yourself as well. This can help give you a self-esteem boost for yourself and let others know that you are willing to put in dedication for yourself. Many people that I have talked to said that they have always felt like their ciommunity helps them grow and feel like they should give something back as well. Doing something remotely even small can benefit anyone's day in comparsion in doing nothing. Working for what you need to do is different for working for what you want to do and this helps you understand the need for self -satisfication and social-satisfication.",0,0.058619954,0,True
B7AABB24BDB8,"Yes,we accomplish more if we are always doing something rather that doing inactivity. If we keep on doing something to accomplish it then victory is always near to us. Our continious work to accomplish any task will be paid later by our better results. Hard work and dedication always lead us towards the success so does if we are always doing something to accomplish the task. Doesn't it sound foolish that inactivity also serve the purpose. It somehow can help to accomplish taking much time but not the same way like if we are always doing somethng.

There is a famous saying that ""Rome was not built in a day"". Here the people were always working for many years to built Rome into a beautiful city. We can see their hard work and dedication really worth it as it is one of the most beautiful city among the world. Would it have been possible if they were doing inactivity? Obvioulsy no nah? Doesn't it sound foolish that inactivity also serve the purpose. It somehow can can help to accomplish taking much time but not the same way like if we are always doing somethng. As ""Where there is will there is the way"" in the same way if we really want something then we can achieve it if we keep on working and always do something for that. I can support it by saying that failure will never ever take you if your determination towards success is strong enough and keep workng for it.

Let's take an example of two students. if two students are assigned a long project in the summer vacation and one student started working from the mean day so that it will be easier from him to complete before the due date whereas the other one kept on realxing thinking that he will start working on it at the last of vacation. Now all of us what the result gonna come. One student happily submitted the project accomplishing it before the due date and the other one had to suffer a lot. So which one would you prefer accomplishing by always doing something in the right time or rushing to complete task in due time.

So,in my opinion always doing something to accompish more is better idea than thinking that inactivity also serve a purpose. No one want to rush to complete any task at the due time so we should be always doing somehing to accomplish more. Slow and steady always wins the race but it doen't mean to say that doing work slowly will worth it everytime. I mean that you should be always doing something in oder to accomplish in time. We can learn lesson from tortoise and rabbit story. From tortoise side,like topic says we should be always doing something to accomplish more or in time in the same way tortoise kept on walking for the race although he can't run having faith in himself that he can do it. From rabbit side we shouldn't do mistake to think our competetors not strong enough than you. We should always respect your competetors thinking that they are as stronger as you and keep doing our assesments to be the most deserving one of that victory. We should have strong believe in ourselves that I can do it then nothing seems impossible.

In conclusion,last but the least I would like to end up saying that if we are always doing something then we can accomplish more compare to the one who works inactively. Time is the most important key factor in our life. Once it is gone it is gone for forever..So,the key point is we should understand the importance of time and utilize it properly and make it effective by always doing something which leads us to the accomplishment of our task.",0,0.007507127,0,True
0C1A8B5D2903,"Mrs. Principal,

I understand that you are reconsidering our school's cell phone policy, and I would like for you to take my ideas into consideration.

I believe that both policies are honorable ideas, but neither is shear perfection.

For the first policy, you proposed allowing students to bring phones to school as long as they were turned off during class time.

The students would most likely be satisfied with being allowed to use their phones during lunch periods and other free times.

Yet, there will, in all likelihood, be a select few that will attempt to continue to use their phones during class time nevertheless.

The second policy stated that students should not be allowed to have phones at school at any time.

Although this would dissolve the issue of phones being on during class, most every student would be outraged at the thought of not having a phone on their person.

Plus, parents might be disgruntled about having no way to contact their child once out of school.

I propose that you combine both policies to create a more plausible one.

Say that students would be allowed to bring their cell phones to school, but it must be turned off and put away at all times.

The only exception would be before school started and after the final class of the day is dismissed.

I sincerely hope that you take my proposals into account when making your final decision about the cell phone policy.

However, I am aware of the fact that you are the principal, and the choice is, in every respect, yours to make.

I heard that you came up with two new cell phone policies and you cant decide which one to use. You probably think since I am a student that I would go for policy number 1 but you are sadly mistaken. I am in favor of policy number two because I know us teenagers. We might agree with turning it off during class time but I assure you we wont. I think we will be on the phone all the time looking on facebook or texting a friend we would hardly pay attention. that would probably be the worst policy in the history of policies.

If you don't believe me you can do an experiment. One class can have policy number 1 and one class can have policy number two. You can teach them the same exact thing and give them the same test on Friday and see who gets the highest percentage passes. To make sure its accurate you can do the test multiple times I'm sure you will get the same results. one reason I think this policy would be a bad idea is that we aren't mature enough to handle having phones on in school . We would probably cheat on tests or something, but that's just my opinion on the matter.

Why Asking More Than One Person is a Good Idea.

Sometimes people ask mutable people for advice. Why people ask mutable people for advice is that more than one person is less likely to be wrong. The three main reasons that a group is less likely to be wrong are different people know different things, they often have different life experints, biases are less likely a group than one person. Asking more people is better than asking one person.

With people knowing different things. That is from that the fact that no one person has the sum toddle of human knallige. Just because two people know the same thing they may have different waste of doing it. In short asking more people will end you up with more infrmashin.

Some people may work in a job outside or inside for exeapul so asking mutable people can have different exeperints. From that asking people with different wases of doing thing so you can find the best way. Anther thing to consider is people have different acutes. With people having different life exepernts it is best to ask more than one person.

In being human comes biases so to avode them you must ask more than one person. Why biases are bad are that they waste your's and others' time. Biases also are more afotin than not wrong. Last they are baste on feelings and not facts. All of those reasons are why biases are one big part of why you should ask more than one person when looking for advice.

In short you should ask more than one person for advice. Why that is the prevesly stated reasons different people know different things, people have different life exepints, and to avode biases. All that is why asking more than one person is better that asking one.",0,0.0068486277,0,True
94110224A627,"Transportation. A means of arriving at your destinations, a reliable way to get around. Humans use transportation everyday whether its by car, walking, biking, running, etc., but we mostly rely on cars to get around. Cars, although very useful in needing to travel, have very unresourceful qualities that humans tend to overlook. These qualities are effecting the enviorment in negative ways. Many countries are taking action to enforce a better protection for the enviorment by limiting usage on cars to reduce the smog pollution and to distance human's reliability on cars.

One of the main issues faced today is pollution because it causes diseases and illnesses, ruining the earth's population. Smog is caused by car pollution which is increasingly more common found throughout the world because of the mass amount of vehicle usage per day. Paris has banned driving on Monday's ""...to clear the air of the global city"". (Par. 10) Many face a 22-euro fine if not obeying by the no-driving policy. This has helped decrease congestion by 60 percent and decrease smog pollution. Diesel fuel was blamed for most of the problems in France due to the majority of diesel engine fueled vehicles. Taking away usage of vehicles minimizes this problem. This drastic change in transportation has encouraged Obama to spread limited car usage to the United States to help the greenhouse gas emissions. The U.S. is most reliable on cars for transportation. Less people in the U.S. over time have delayed on recieving their leaners permit and license, decreasing car usage. ""...beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the enviorment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions..."". (Par. 34)

Although pollution is a prime issue, humans rely way too much on cars as a means of transportation. In order to help this problem Vauban, Germany has gotten rid of cars. They have limited car usage to only a few places, such as huge highways where they're necessary, and they have limited parking to huge garages instead of ones in your house. This has become an increasing impact on the world and other countries by showing ""...an example of a growing trend...to seperate suburban life from auto use,..."". (Par. 4) Bogota, Columbia is also eager to spread the decrease in car limitiation to other countries by taking off days from car usage. This has helped humans to become more proactive and to become active in keeping the enviorment safe and pollution free. Relying less on cars benefits humans as well because not as much of their money will be turned towards automobiles. ""In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport"". (Par. 9) This has impacted the enviorment and humans in a beneficial way.

Promoting more car-reduced communties, has proven to be more effective in caring for the emnviorment. Many countries that take action in reducing automobile usage have more control financially and decrease pollution meandering through the earth's precious air. Limiting car usage is an advantage on society because it reduces smog and makes humans less reliable on cars for transportation.    ",0,0.0068305316,0,True

They get us from point A to B for sure but, do we really need to rely on them that often? I don't think so. As we limit our car usage, the air pollution lowers, fewer car accidents happens, and road rage? Gone.

Limiting car usage have many benitfits, such as the air pollution lowers. In some countries, for example Paris, they ban driving due to smog. fter near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the gobal city. As of that Monday, they would fine motorists with even-numbered license plates a 22-euro fine($31). The effect of this was that public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday.

In Bogota, Colombia, millions of Colombians participated in a car-free day leaving the streets traffic jam free. It was their third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted. It didn't stop people from participating even though gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" said a businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bike with his wife. This campaign began back in the mid-1990s. Without cars, parks and sports centers have bloomed throughtout the city. They even fixed the uneven pitted sidewalks and replaced them with smooth sidewalks. A city of 7 million, rush hour have dramatically cut traffic as they have their car-free day.

As for the United States, President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions. Recent studies shows that Americans are buying fewer cars and getting fewer licenses as each year go by. Another study has shown that there has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39 year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age, Mr. Sivak's research has found. Without cars, people are expected to walk more and car pool with friends or take buses. This will dramatically decrease greenhouse gas and air pollution. In Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Moter Company, has laid out a bussiness plan where they create cities in which pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and impove safety.

In conclusion, by not driving a car, air pollution lowers, fewer car accidents happen, and no traffic jams. From different sources, different effects happens when cars are banned. In Paris, smog is a thing in the past, no traffic jam for a city of 7 million in Bogota, and in Barcelona, public transportations are connected and is faster to get to point A to point B.

They are busy in the day, so they like to have fun at night. They don't do their homework because they go out at night. It effects their studies really bad.

Now, with the advancement in computers and technology, homework can be transformed into classwork that students can do throughout the day from the bed they sleep on. Many benefits are offered to both students and teachers when using online videos and conferencing for students at home. Almost every student has online access, encouraging sick and injured students to still do work at home without missing class time. Though a few problems exist with attending class from home, the benefits ultimately outweigh the negatives.

With current day technology, students have access to the internet almost everywhere they go. With the introduction of

Google's Chromebook more than 5 years ago ,

students are able to use their schools laptop for completing online work at their house. This encourages the idea that students don't need to have a phone or a home computer in order to complete work online. Even with no internet at home, students have the ability to go to the library to get free public WiFi. Thanks to another Google based website;

Google Classroom is a website where teachers can create private online classes where they upload classwork and other useful information students can view via an invitation code to the class. With a site like

Google Classroom, students have an extremely high chance of doing online work without much hassle, such as needing hard copies of the missed classwork and lessons. Theoretically speaking, hundreds of millions of students around the world already do this. This enchances the idea of ""Online Classwork"" instead of just ""Online homework, which many of us are already familiar with.

Additionally, the incredible online accessiblity grants students who are sick, injured, or missed school because of snow days, the option to do work online. When students are sick or injured, they are highly advised to stay at home. This brings up the still occuring problem of missing assignments and lessons. By offering online lessons and assignments, these students are able to complete their classwork without being behind and having F's put in for assignments, even with an excused absence. Furthermore, if school is cancelled because of snow or even the spreading of the Coronavirus, teachers have the ability to assign online work to their students. Teachers also have the ability to post videos of the lessons, which may help the students in need. With that added benefit, both students and teachers have less work to worry about. This introduces the idea of saving time. With the addition of online lessons and classwork, students and teachers are being granted the ability to not miss a certain unit or lesson, limiting many students from falling behind on classwork and other assignments.

However, there are a few negatives that come to play when it comes to online conferencing and classwork. As many adults are aware of by now, laziness is common amongst many teens. Students who don't feel like completing their online work will instead: play video games, hang out with friends, or do non-educational activities. While this is completely up to the student, online assignments can be brushed off and seen as useless if given many opportunities to fix that mistake. Along with laziness, students are more capable of cheating by looking up answers or asking friends whether or not they have completed certain online assignments. This limits students from learning and not taking classwork seriously, which possibly limits their potential of passing future tests. If a student does not understand an assignment they are doing even if their teacher uploaded a video of a lesson, the student will need to schedule a time to have a video conference with their teacher. This can be a problem due to the teacher being unavailable until a certain time, or unvailable the whole day.

Even with the few added negatives of attending online classes from home, students are offered the ability to keep their grades up by doing school work online at home. Teachers can also save their time chasing down a student for missing assignments as long as the student is able to complete their work online. In conclusion, attending classes from home is a great idea for students in need, as they get the opportunity to complete their assignments without hassle, stay on top of class lessons, and save both their and their teachers time.",0,0.011416014,0,True
E0E527C91133,"I believe the use of the technology to read students emotional expression is pretty suffisticated, but i dont think it is nessisary. in the article, humans can assume other people's emotions because we have the same emotions as everyone else. Us humans know what it looks like to be happy, suprised, angery, disgusted, scared, and sad because we all go threw it. I know that there is obviously more that only 6 emotions, Some people feel jellousy and some may feel uncomfortable, others may feel paine and some will feel stress. That is already 4 more emotions that we can calculate and a computer can't. Another thing that humans can callculate is sound. We can here if a person is crying, We can detect that they might be sad. If someone is yelling, we can detect that they are mad, or got hurt, they might even be excited depending on the tone of the voice. Those are a coupple of reasons why i think we dont reqlly need the technology of reading emotional expressions, maybe that is just a little extra.

I dont think we need to ""calculate"" the way people feel threw a computer. I wouldnt want everyone knowing how i feel at all moments. I'd like my privatcy! If i want to talk about how i feel to someone that i trust then i would but i know that i definitally would not like anyone and everyone being able to know my emotion whenever theyd like. Just knowing that this could be possible... gives me chills. This should not be used on everyone, especally if they dont feel comfortable about it.

I understand that the machines can modify lessons like an effective human instructor or it can make computer-animated faces more expressive for video games or even video sergery which is pretty amazing. I do agree that the emotion analyzinig shouls be used for things like that. it helps out the way technolgy looks and aslo atrackts more people to it. ""The facial expression for each emotion are universal""

that is something they have said while detecting the Mona Lisa.

Tecnologhy like a computer can obviously change the world wit5h people creating and discoveribg new idias to shar with everyone including the world.

I say we dont ditch the tecnology all together, but maybe just the parts that we can handle on our own like, detecting emotions on other people. Instead we can focus on comuincating. We can develope these skills to distinguish emotions instead of not gaining any knowledge and letting technology do all the work for us.

There are many kids who want to participate in community service and others who do not. I think that students should be required to attend a certain amount of community service in order to graduate. However the amount of hours the students are required to attend should be kept at a minimum.

Students should have to attend a certain amount of community service because it will teach them that it is important to help others. It is important to learn to help others because in the future it will help them mature, and become a better person.

Community service is also important because it will give students a chance to see what kinds of jobs they would and wouldn't like to do in the future. This way they would have a easier time choosing their careers.

The required amount of community service should be minimal because it will still give the students a chance to do what they want. Although it is important to help others it is also important to be independent. Students must be able to express themselves in order to be independent and that should not be taken away from them.

In conclusion, students should be required to attend a certain amount of community service, however it should be kept at a minimum. This is because it will help them mature as a person, give them an idea of what they would like to do in the future, and still give them a chance to do what they want.",0,0.006614296,0,True
05B240EC2A33,"Have you ever wondered if there are any other living things in the universe? Maybe some where in a far away place, maybe on our neighbor Mars. A picture surfaced during 1976 showing what looks like a face on Mars, people were saying that it is in fact a fact of aliens on Mars, but it could also be a landform.

First of all, the face in 1976 is much more noticable than it is in the most recent picture from 2001. Also, if it were a face were is the rest of its body? Is it just a huge head sitting in the dirt. As well, how would such a huge person fit on the planet? The picture's pixels come in at about 46 meters per pixel. Could a face really be that big. Conspirests can believe that it is proof there is other living things on Mars, but wouldn't finding something on Mars benifit NASA's budget?

NASA could be getting millions if not billions of dollars if they found other living things on Mars. Goverments would be preparing journeys and preparing astronauts to go investigate the face. Also, if NASA was hiding it from the public, the would lose more money because they could start fundraisers to help send people and robots to Mars. They would be credited world wide for their findings. The people who controled Viking 1 and 2 would gain publicity from their findings as well. Why would NASA hide something that could put so much money into research? They wouldn't, it cannoto be anything else other than a landform. Plus, wouldn't we see many other things surrounding the place.

If the face was really part of an extra terestrial civilization, why would they have just a face and no other things surrounding it. Wouldn't there also be a little person or something walking around the place. Some may say that they are all inside teh face, but then shouldn't there be a visible way of entry into the place. They can't just breach a wall and rebuild it every time they want to enter the place. The camera pixels in the most recent 2001 photo is 1.56 meters per pixel. That is shorter than most teenagers, The photo would cleary show some sort of person or another form of transportation in the photo. I personally doubt that the face isn't home to other people who live on Mars. I maybe wrong, but until I can see actual information showing that there is and photos, I don' t believe it.

Maybe one day there will be a voyage to this face on Mars, but until then I belive that it is just a landform. Other people may believe what they want, but it looks exactly like a landform to me. There isn't enough facts to support it is something else, but unless there is a voyage to this place, then it will continue to be just a landform to me.",0,0.008187531,0,True
0504EEB01AD9,"Dear ,

I have recently heard that you are considering changing the C average for participating in sports or other activities to a B average. Although I do fully understand why you would choose to do this I believe that it should be kept at a C average. Many students in this school participate in additional activities and it is hard to keep your grades at tip top level. It's sort of like multi-tasking, it doesn't really work. Some students may want to take up a career in a certain sport or major in a certain activity. It's not always easy to be the best at both.

Many students at this school play soccer on the school soccer team and are considering doing it professionally. That may sound ridiculous to a person who works business because a sport doesn't sound like a suitable job for a life. An athlete would disagree. That is the job that person would enjoy doing for awhile. Work is supposed to be a job you do to earn money, but it should also be enjoyable, after all you do have to work everyday. It would be difficult for a student to have to focus on two things, grades and sports. If that student so chooses to be an athlete, than they'll want to focus on their sport.

Changing the grade may be one positive thing for our school, but many negative things follow. Trust me, you will get many complaints from students and parents daily. A grade C has always been the average for participating in sports/activities and I think that is very reasonable. Most people anyways do better than that anyhow, but pressuring students to keep their grade above a B may be asking a lot. Again that means they have to focus on academics and activities.

Think about when you first wanted to become a teacher or a principal. In High school and college you just wanted to focus on academics and becoming a great, fun teacher. But college required you taking extracurricular activities. How did you feel? You only wanted to focus on one thing and they made you focus on two, but less on one. Students who participate in sports feel the same way. They have to take both academics and sports, but they would much rather just be doing the sport. Aren't teachers, parents... grown-ups always telling us to follow our dreams. Limiting our dreams is only going to be misguiding your words.

I really do want you to think about what I said before you change the Grade average. Thank you so much for taking your own time out of your day to read this and consider it. I, and the students really do appreciate it!

I think we should be aloud to use cell phones during free periods. Technology is part of the future and we will use it when we are older. It will help us become adults. We can also keep up with our friends and our parents can call to tell us if there is a problem. Kids already use them.

But the cell phones should be shut off during class to stop distractions. We all need to face it we will all be using technology in the future. Most of our jobs will require a computer or cell phone. Why not let us express our freedom. If you tell them they cant use there cell phones they will want to use them and if you tell them they can they will think your cool and wont argue with you as much.

Another reason cell phones should be shut off during class is because the kids could text each other the answers. Let us express our freedom. If teachers can use them let us so we our all equal, and we don't look down on each other. I agree There has to be rules but we also should be aloud freedom.

You might love the place I want to go to or you might not like it,at the end its your choice if you like the place or not. Where is one place in the world you would like to visit this place,and what you would want to do or see once you arrive there.

First,One place i would want to visit is Spain because there are beautiful places like for example Generic_City,Spain orGeneric_City,Spain. Those are the two places that majority of the people wants to visit those places. Majority of the people want to visit Generic_City,Spain orGeneric_City,Spain because of the soccer teams that are there. One of them its called Generic_City and the other team called Real Generic_City. Those are the two soccer team majority of the people in this world prefer.

Second,One place i would want to go specificly is Generic_City,Spain because there a stadium thats from a soccer knowns as the Real Generic_City. I heard that it's a good place to be distracted from all your work and issues. What i want to see when i arrive at Generic_City spain is the beautiful statue that are in there. In spain there is beautiful places people can go. You can go to resturant which some of those resturant have good food.

D1D8B04AF3A3,"Many schools in America assign summer assignments so the students will continue to learn throughout their summer break. Now this has people starting to question whether the assignment should be designed by the students or by the teacher. Which would be more beneficial to the students work ethic in the classroom for the upcoming year? While teachers have the experience and abilities to create the summer assignments, the projects should be designed by the students because the they would not feel as pressured or stressed and the students would base the project around what they need to learn.

To begin with, students designing their summer assignments would put less stress and pressure onto the student. The students being able to choose the amount of work they do over summer break will help the students feel better about the work and not feel as stressed about turning it in. While learning in school is a requirement and need for children and teenagers, it puts a lot of pressure onto the students which is harmful to the students well-being and mental health. During the summer, students should not have to worry about more work to get done by a certain due date. Instead, they should only be worried about their mental health and taking a well deserved break. After going to school for about nine months with very short breaks, students deserve to be able to sit back and relax for a little but instead they get bombarded by test graded projects from the school. Most of the time, students are unaware of the assignments or do not understand what they are supposed to be doing so they just do not turn in an assignment at all which results in the student starting the school year off with poor grades. It is important and beneficial for students to do these projects but the teacher-designed ones often become too much for a student to handle, especially with numerous ones from different teachers. The school should not put more stress onto their students by giving them projects that can lower their grade at the very beginning of a new school year.

Another reason summer assignments should be student-designed is because the students would focus the project more around what they need to learn. Most summer assignments are based on subjects the student has already learned, when the projects should be teaching them about what they are going to learn within the new class. If the summer assignments were student-designed, they would dig further into the new subject rather than working on items that they have already learned. It would be beneficial to the students if the work was more centered around what is going to be taught within the next school year. The students would also center the work around what feels most comfortable to them. Most teachers who give summer assignments do not think about what the kid may or may not be able to do. Meanwhile, students would rather work on items that they are able to do by themselves without any outside help. Some may say that the students would just give themselves less work resulting in them being lazy and not learning anything over their break and that the students would be unaware of the curriculum that they would be learning within the upcoming year so they would have no clue about what to focus their summer assignment on. While the students would give less work to themselves, it would be more beneficial to their learning experience and well-being. Also their teachers could provide a copy of the curriculum to the students so they would know what to base their project on.

In conclusion, teachers do an outstanding job at teaching during the school year but students should be able to design their own summer assignments. Students should able to create their own assignments because it would help the student not feel as stressed or pressured over their break. It would also be beneficial to their learning process because they would focus more on what they need to learn versus what has already been taught.",0,0.0071405,0,True

First, the students has topic. When a student has a one topic, they cant go talk about another topic. The student doesn't have to struggle between three or more subjects because they have one given to them. The teacher gives a specific topic because it's supposed to challenging.

Second, the topic is easy. Some school teachers give their students easy topics because they wants students to enjoy their summer break. The subject should be easy for two reason for example: they had the topic before or its very simple.

Third, the subject is fast to do. The topic should be fast to do because the teacher was able to do it. Their previous students was able to do it with no problem. The student should get the project done because it helps them retain the information the learned.

Students-designed projects are interesting to give over the summer break. They are interesting for many reasons. The first reason is because the students has free to work on any topic they want. Second, it's going to make the teacher curious to see what the student did as a project. Third, student would get it done quicker because they want to have enough time for the summer.

c3e2e9e5,"Driving is the primary way of transportation, to get from point A to point B. It's a great way to reduce traveling time, and traffic is almost nonexistent. Some people would say it's better than walking, or riding a bicycle. But what if we limited these polluting vehicles and replaced our transportation for our daily routine? Well, we can. Limiting car usage can help us from lots of city andor regional pollution. It can improve safety and conserve the resources we already have. Saving even more time is also something all people want to try to accomplish. Limiting the use of cars can help make this world a much better, and more breathable, reusable, and not a timeconsuming place.

To begin with, the answer to why we should limit the use of cars is stated in the form of pure science: pollution. All around the world, from North America to Asia, every continent has a majorly polluted city. Beijing, London, Mexico City, Miami, New York City, you name it! Major cities nowadays are becoming more polluted than ever before, due to gasoline and diesel fuel used in cars today. Overpopulated cities can have too many cars, and too many cars driven can increase the amount of polluted air around us. In document two, the capital of France, Paris, is home to almost ten million people. After days of an almostbroken record amount of pollution intoxicating the city, Paris enforced a driving ban for two days. Cars and motorcycles were forced to be left at home, or a steep fine will be charged. Even though almost 4,000 drivers were fined, congestion in Paris decreased by nearly 60%, after intense smog. Diesel fuel was the culprit to this pollution, due to France's tax policy that favors diesel fuel rather than gasoline. Diesel fuel cars make up about 67% of cars in France, comparing to an average 57% of diesel engines in Western Europe, according to Reuter's. The smog cleared enough on Monday for the French politicians to rescind the ban. In document three, Columbia's capital city, Bogota, had a goal to promote alternatives to personal transportation and reduce the amount of smog throughout the city. Day Without Cars was born, one day every month where cars are not allowed to be driven, or a fine will be charged. The turnout of people was immense, even though rain showers and thunderstorms poured onto the event. Mayor Antanas Mockus stated that the Day Without Cars ""was a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Parks and sports centers rose from the city streets, and sidewalks have been paved for bicycles and ongoing pedestrians. Limiting car usage is not be a bad thing, considering we need the air we already breathe.

Furthermore, limiting car usage is not a bad solution to the global pollution, and is not a bad solution to improve safety and conserve resources, either. Teenagers all over the world are more prone to accidents than any other age group. Getting your license is great, and driving alone is equally as awesome, but having no regard for safety while driving? Not as awesome as it sounds. For an additional document, it's life itself. Driving on a daily basis takes up gasoline, and lots of it. On average, a normal driver takes up about twenty gallons of gasoline a week, if not, more. Diesel fuel used in pickup trucks and semitrucks is more expensive, but lasts longer than regular gasoline. Resources have dwindled since the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico of 2011, and regular Americans are running out of the food for their car. On the safety spectrum, looking out for a street to turn at, for pedestrians, and for people that may cut you off sounds like a blast, but safety and crashesaccidents end up to be a result in many driving situations. Many people consider for driving to be unsafe, due to the statistics of daily crashes on highways, and even intersections, which happen to be the most dangerous place you can have an accident. Those types of people have put a hold on driving, and have caused a decline in the nation's miles driven per person scale, stated in document four. As of April of 2013, the number driven per person went down almost nine percent. Factors to that decline may have been the 2008 stock recession, or the fact that cars got smaller and more expensive. As a result, more people started to walk to work, or buy a bicycle, like they use mainly in Amsterdam in the Netherlands. Safety is becoming a subject that is mainly disregarded by citizens, and resources are becoming less and less, yet the alternatives for driving, such as walking or taking the city bus, are becoming more and more popular.

Moreover, car usage should become more limited because they are other ways, faster and more efficient ways, to get to your destination. Major cities all over the globe have a multitude of ways to transport people from one side of the city to the other. Taking buses, walking, taking the subway, helicopter, taxis, anything! Except a car. Car use in major cities is almost unheard of, as traffic is everywhere in a big city, and overpopulation can cause the traffic, or at least, be the contributing factor of it. People want to get to another place in sixty seconds or less, and driving in that matter never happens. For example, car use in New York City is busy. Of course, being ""the city that never sleeps"", cars are not the best way to get around. Walking or taking the subway underground helps get the people around easier and faster. As expected, a large drop in the percentage of teenagers getting there license has occurred, according to ducment four. New York has a new bikesharing program, and it's skyrocketing bridgetunnel tolls reflect those new priorities taking place. Driving by young people decreased significantly between 2001 and 2009. Woven into a connected web to save time, new alternatives to the polluting machines we call cars are slowly backing up into reverse, and disappearing from the category of main transportation.

In conclusion, limiting car usage is the best option to acheive all of the contributing factors. Pollution hurts cities and their environments, even their people. The air we breathe is more important than the amount of time it takes reach our destination. Safety improvements need to happen to make drivers have common sense and to not run over someone crossing the street. Resources are limited everywhere, and what we'll do after they've been gone? That answer has not been found yet. Saving time is our numberone priority, and we try to beat our records every time we go somewhere, whether it be using the same mode of transportation, or trying out a new one. Next time, be spontaneous for a day, and don't use a car. Try a new way to get to work taking the subway and watching a new scene come at you every two seconds or walk to work and admire the time slowing by around you. Breathe the fresh air like never before. Remember: it's not the destination that yiou should look forward to it's the journey.",0,0.0070355334,0,True

Even though this face is so detailed with the mouth and the eyes and nose, it's just a natural landform. NASA even said it for themselves.

A67891ECF902,"The foundation of a summer project is very important, as it introduces past topics for a student over break to evaluate once attained. When deciding whether a teacher or a student should design the summer project, i believe it is best for a teacher to create the summer project. The reason i choose for the project to based off a teacher was due to the teacher being professional,experienced, and for their effort.

Given the fact that teachers are professionally trained to educate, it helps establish the projects legitimacy and create's a sense that the project is resourceful. Also teachers have been taught how to teach at colleges and are certified to be apart of the educational system. Their number of years teaching adds on to their own experience and would help show how well they are at educating students. Because teachers teach for a living, it induces a feeling that a teacher does their job with all the effort they can put and prove that they are reliable to teach youth effortless. Being a professional helps a lot with any task, like a mechanic repairing a car who can fix it expertly, while a business man who has not much knowledge in the field of auto repair.

The effort teachers put in their work is amazing, as it helps the students understand and learn the subject more easily. Every teacher is different in a way, and their difference helps implement certain techniques to teach students a topic. A teachers skill can vary in multiple ways, and this helps their teaching ability, which also affects how a student learns. Depending on how much effort one teacher puts into his or her job may also determine how resourceful they are in helping a student learn, so that all students can rely on their teacher for help when it is needed. When someone puts effort into anything they desire, what comes out from that hard work is success and when teachers devote effort they only help each student succeed in learning.

When it comes to learning, a teacher is best related to that subject and are best known for the experience they have. Being in the educational system helps the teachers show the students they are not new to teaching and experienced in the education stage. While being in the education system so long they have gotten used to their own way of teaching. Because of how experienced a teacher can be, they can encourage students better and work harder, so they know how to help any and all students to strive better. A good example of this would be a officer in the army, who is experienced and can encourage and make a good example of himself to help his recruits strive and work better.

All these reasons help prove how much it would benefit if it were a teacher who is a professionally trained, greatly experienced, and most importantly, puts in the effort needed to help his or her students succeed. And the summer project would be absolute perfection if made by a teacher.                ",0,0.0066191168,0,True
2825E9B520B0,"At the end of the year, the only thing the students can focus on is the prospect of summer break - a time filled with laughter, bikinis, and the absence of school. Unfortunately, these dreams are dashed when the hated summer projects are assigned. The idea of these dull, time-consuming projects swallowing their break would make any student feel dreary. However, the only problem with assigned summer projects is that they are often nothing more than busy work. The solution is simple - if summer projects were tailor-made to excite and interest creative minds, they could transform from a boring chore to the most valuable experience in a student's life so far. So, we should allow students to pick their own summer projects according to their personal taste because the projects will be more creative and they will have many more positive effects on the students's lives; although some may disagree.

Although many view children as naive and unable to have in-depth ideas, children have an incredible talent for these skills. For instance, I have never met an adult that would be able to come up with a completely furnished fairy castle, a complex story arc involving multiple close shaves with terrifying villains, and an entire gown made only of tissue paper, glitter, and their mother's scarf; yet, I have witnessed children create these beautiful, nuanced universes in which they can completely lose themselves time after time. Clearly, children and teens are much more adaptive and able to create interesting, all-encompassing ideas than adults, so we might feel called to ask why it is assumed that students in school require adult supervision and help when creating something to study. This positive aspect of students' minds should be extended to school - especially summer projects. Students will happily spend the summer creating something centered around what they love most, be it graphic novels, painting, or the like.

Along this vein, not only will students be inclined to work on their projects if they are interested in them, they will also be prouder of the work they do. Personally, I have completed many projects that were assigned to drill the same information over and over; even if I am interested in a subject, it is extremely hard to be invested when I am drowning in monotony. However, when I am presented with a unique, self-directed project, my creative juices start flowing. For instance, I was recently tasked with designing a way to treat Cystic Fibrosis with Gene Therapy. I knew nothing about this treatment, however, I researched the subject and ended up creating an extremely interesting presentation that I am immensely proud of. When students are assigned interesting, challenging projects, they throw themselves into them and are able to create things they actually proud of.

In contrast, many would argue that, without the direction of teachers, students would flounder and could not even come up with an idea let alone research and design it. However, this does not take into account students' ability to adapt and flourish in challenging situations, or that the only reason these students haven't shown enthusiasm and creativity in teacher-assigned projects is that they have not been given the chance. No student will excel if their teacher treats them like they're incapable of intelligent ideas. I have seen so many smart and able students' lights dimmed by overprotective teachers who do not let them use their brains. For instance, a friend of mine has dyslexia, which makes classes were one has to focus on spelling or reading long texts very difficult for her. Because of this, she was kept behind in multiple classes when she was growing up despite the fact that she is incredibly smart. However, when she started attending highschool, people finally started giving her a chance, and she is now excelling in Latin and is a talented artist. Clearly, students are able to handle much more than they are given credit for, and should be allowed the freedom that comes with self-designed projects.

Obviously, inflexible teachers and unhelpful outlines only hinder a student's success by not letting them use their creativity to design something they love and can be proud of. Undoubtedly, summer projects should be student designed because they will foster creativity and give the students an immense sense of pride in their work. Furthermore, this principle could be extended to all areas of school because children are much more able, creative, adaptive, and impressive than our suffocating school system allows in certain areas. Given this freedom, our new generations can lead happier, healthier, and more creative lives.",0,0.010042447,0,True

I do not think it is fair that you are requesting students to possess a t least a grade B average because, to some students use sports to ""get away"" at and some students struggle to achieve high academic grades in class.

To begin with, to certain students they use sports to "" get away"".

Some kids use sports to get away from struggles at home, having to deal with drama or certain stress they may have.

Now Students have so much stress and drama that some come to the conclusion of suicide, sports may be a vent were the don't have to worry about things. Students may feel like sports are the only thing in which they don't have to worry about things. It could be a place where they can meet up with their friends who they know wont cause stress and you would be taking that away from them.

In addition, Some students struggle to achieve high academic grades in class.

Getting good grades most times isn't easy. Some students have high school credit classes and honors classes and this is hard to be in. Students can get nerves during test and not score as great of a grade as they could because of this. It wouldn't be fair if a few bad test grades would not only cause their grades to suffer but to punish them away from a sport. Also i think a grade C average is just fine because for those who struggle to get high grades it is an easier step. It wouldn't limit them from doing something that they really want to do or that they have fun in doing.

In conclusion, I do not think it is fair if you change the policy to having a grade B average because, it wouldn't allow students to "" get away "" from stress and it wouldn't be fair for the students who struggle to get high academic grades.            ",0,0.006984769,0,True
B00B5447FE83,"I think we should be able to have cell phones on during class (Policy 1) . It's free time. It won't change our education.

You wouldn't be able to ask your friends the answers to a test or the homework or anything like that.

If there would be a family emergency, we wouldn't be able to know about it. If we had our phone on, they could call us and we would know about it. We then wouldn't be left out. If a family member was about to pass away, we could talk to them for the last time instead of rushing to the hospital before it's to late.

If there was a gunman in the school, we could just reach in our pocket and tell the police where were at instead of having the phone in our locker and risking our life to get it.

Having the phone with you and on could save your life one day.

It could come to a simple thing such as missing the bus in the winter. Then you couldn't call your Mom to come and pick you up. You would need to walk home in the freezing cold. If you live far away from school, you would need to walk all the way home and risk being hit by a car if you have to cross a highway. Then you got your parents worried where you are and if your ok.

If we forgot our school project at home, we could call our parents to bring it to school so we don't fail the grade and miss the Honor Roll. Then we wouldn't have a failing grade for ourselves and if we have a partner. Your phone could help you both pass.

There is one new technological advancement that could change our lives entirely, the self driving car. The self driving car is a car that well does what it sounds like, it drives its self. Although there are many positive aspects for this new invention im here to talk about the bad. This new technological advancement should not be develped because, the driver would still have to be alert, if the technology fails who is to blame, and it is just to pricey.

It would suck if you were in a car that can drive itself but you still had to be there alert. The self driving cars requires you to be there constantly holding the wheel. If you are at the wheel aready why shouldnt you just drive the car yourself? Plus the car can only move no faster than 25mph. We tend to go faster than that so you might as well do it yourself. Also it would be like your waiting for your turn to drive. You would only be getting the car to drive in risky or dangerous situations. Lastly it would get boring waiting there in your car with your hands on the wheel.

Say you got into a crash, who is it to blame? You take your eyes off the road for a split secong and bang, your self driving car just crashed into another car. Is the fault yours or was it the cars? See if we make these cars we would have to make new laws on whos to blame. Also it wouldnt be safe for pedestrians and you. If the systems fail you could go crashing into something or someone without a warning. The best way to ensure someones safety is with a human driver behind the wheel.

Most people wouldnt even be able to afford a self driving car in the first place. If and when these cars come out, the average american wouldnt be able to afford it. With all that technology on and in the car it would most likely double the price of cars if not increase it drasticly.

A4D245A77427,"Dear Principle,

I believe that students should be able to have their phones during school. I think that phones are a nice resource to have. Although students are allowed to have their phones you could put restrictions on when they are allowed to be used. You could tell students that they are only allowed to be used during free times and not classes. If you find a student using their phone during class you could take it away.

I think letting them use their phones would resist them from the temptations to hide using it. Whether they are allowed to or not they will still use their phones. They will just hide the fact that they are using them. If you don't let them use their phones. It would make it less cool to use their phone because everyone will be using them but if you say that they can't then they will just be more rebellious and try to use it without your knowledge. You could make consequences for misusing your phone.

Our phones are a good source of communication and something that we should take advantage of. It makes communicating with your parents much easier and quicker. Instead of going through assistants or teacher for parents to talk to their students they could just contact them. It is also a good way for students to find each other. If they are working on a project together it makes it easier for them to get in contact to talk or find each other. I think that the pros are greater than the cons and in either one of these policies their will be issues but they can be worked on.

I think that students should not have their phones at school at all because not all students will listen to the rules.

One reason I choose policy 2 is because some kids would use them during class and then they would get in trouble.

They would be used to cheat on tests, text friends, and get on the internet.

Many kids would use them to look up answers for papers, tests, homework, or any other projects.

Some might even use them to get on chat rooms or any other website, like facebook and myspace.

Some students would then forget to turn them off, if they were allowed to have them on during free times.

Then they would become a interruption to the educational process.

Teachers would have to stop class and have to tell the student to turn it off or even some teachers would take the phones.

Many kids would have to pick up the phones at the end of the day so they didn't get in trouble again.

More kids would get their phones out after they finish something in class, like homework or a project even if they weren't allowed.

Many students would get in trouble with their phones then without them.

Some students could even use the cameras on their phones to take mean pictures or inappropriate pictures.

There would be more bullying going on with classmates and friends.

Mean stuff could be sent around the school about other kids.

Some kids would even send out rumors causing someone to get hurt.

There would be more causes of kids getting bullied if students were allowed their phones.

Many students would use them so much during lunch that they would get into their conversations with others that they would not eat their lunch.

That would have more students wasting their lunches.

Sometimes there would even be a ton of leftovers that the cooks made and then you would eat the leftovers the next day for lunch.

Students having their phones could cause some major damage to friendships and grades.

I ,as a SCHOOL_NAME Student, think that having community work should be required. Community work will help not just the community but will also help your self. Doing a little help for the community is not something that should just be thought of as not important. It should be something that people like to do, I mean its your community the place were you live, why wouldn't you want your city to look as great as any other place.

Being a student here makes me proud to be who I am. Helping the community out is nothing to pay for just being here at this school. Without a community this school would not be here, even if it was no one wants to go to some dirty and totally nasty school. Why would you want that, when if every one helps out for just a little while your community would look great and then every one would want to go to your school or your community to live in, meaning more jobs, more money, and more families.

Now I can see why someone would say, ""Help out the community, why would I do that. I have better things to do. That's why they have jobs to clean the city."" Well that is true, but I say that if no one was to help the community why would any one want to come to a place were every is to lazy to help out the community. Which in turn will have people, say like your neighbor, who will need your help with something like putting up Christmas lights up, and you might just say no and say to hire someone to do it for you. The community is a place of friends and families growing up together, not fighting each other.

First, student can make it a peeling for one and another, many will only do it if the works grabs their attention. The more students what to do the project the mare effort or thought will be put in to it. who better to make a project to keep students attention the the students themselves. Because while students are on break many do not have people to push them and make sure they are doing their work so it has to be a project that they would want to do on their own. and if a blunder is made the student can't say they didn't understand because the students designed the projects. This will be a way to grab the attention of whoever grades the project, like a hook in a essay.

Next, it will help build creative students, just as school is supposed to do for students. Yes schools are a place of learning, but while students are in school they are building creative thoughts that are just waiting to be used. giving the students the chance to design their summer summer project helps give the schools notice of what future creator you are putting into the world. If the students are creating their own summer project it teaches then about Independence, and that they don't need a teacher standing over top of them to do their work. With student designing their own project it will make great business skills.

EB39727D0F7B,"This is the age that students should start to find new hobbies, passions, and goals they wish to have for the future as well as have available careers and colleges. I agree that students should participate in after school activities, here's why.

This idea could bring students to discover new hobbies and interests they might really enjoy. Evidently, this can help students to make new friends that share similar interests. This activity they might participate in could keep them active physically or mentally depending on what activity they wish to join. Every student is different with different interests, so they might not all like the options available. Students should look forward to what they enjoy doing in there child hood and carry those hobbies into there adult lives.

This is a great time for students to understand and follow there passions into the future where they can find career options and scholarships. These activities help students become more open minded about there future and over all make them better than ever in school and outside of school as well. Finding the right passion for each student is important so they know what they will strive for and where they believe there path leads into finding the best future they can have for themselves. Finding the right passion for the students is very important depending on which club they want and what the students want to learn in school as well.

Finally, all these ideas could help plant the goals they wish to achieve into their minds so they can work harder to achieve them and become more responsible with time, money, education, and work. Students have a wide variety of career paths and options to chose from, this is giving them a step in the right direction so they can see what they enjoy doing.

The second is based off of conspiracy. This idea is based off of external life outside of Earth. The people that believe in this point of view think that aliens have created this landform.

I myself believe in the research part of the concept. There is just not enough physical evidence to say that it is aliens. This is just an idea that many conspiracy theorists believe. Sometimes their theories can be a little enticing, but they never really have any evidence to back up any of it. The idea of aliens making this lanform had been created by some ""very creative"" minds and was probably thought of when the pictures weren't high enough quality to make anything out of them.

Now lets say that there are aliens living on Mars. In order for them to make this landform, they would have to know about humans. They would have to know what a human face looked like. They would also have to know that we are smart enough to be studying them and they would have to be smart enough to study us. The chances of them finding out all of this information without ever getting recognized by anybody are slim to none. Again, it all coms back to research. There is no evidence of aliens.

D0A7DA572ED0,"Summer break is a time of joy for adults and students alike. However, for students their brains still need to be stimulated so that when they go back to their everyday school-lives they do not forget what they have learned. The means of producing that knowledge for students however, can either be from teachers or from their student peers. Although students should be assigned teacher-designed projects because their assignments are guaranteed to be curriculum based, summer projects should be student-designed because students are able to enjoy themselves over break, they are given the chance to be creative in their learning, and will not be stressed over the summer.

To begin with, students are able to design projects that will bring enjoyment to their fellow classmates. Pupils have common interest to one another, so they would be able to create a project that would be equally enjoyable to their classmates. As a result, this enjoyment will make students more willing to participate in their summer assignment because when someone enjoys doing something they are more apt to do it no matter the amount of time or work that goes into it. Furthermore, if an assignment were to be given over the break, that assignment should be something students enjoy doing. The reason being because summer is the season of enjoyable recreation and by allowing students, who are equally eager to have fun over the break, design said project they are able to stay true to point of summer.

In continuation, student-designed projects give students the ability to add creativity to their learning. On a regular school day teachers are the ones who decide how students will lean. Sometimes what the teacher chooses is only beneficial to a handful of students, and the others have to make due with what they have. By giving the students a chance to make a summer project, they can come up with a learning process that is geared towards their peers. Students feel more comfortable expressing the way they feel they learn best with their classmates, so by giving the creative liberty to students the product created will be something that benefits everyone.

Furthermore, with students designing their own summer projects they will not be stressed over the break. Students are aware of each others needs and their own personal needs, so as a result, they will create an assignment that will not overwork their classmates or themselves. The reason being whatever project is created by the students will most likely have to be completed by the creators too, so if they assign something that will take the majority of the summer to complete or cause a decrease in their mental health, they will have to participate in this assignment as well. However, if a teacher made the summer project they would not have to pay the same price. Which is why a project made by teachers will not be as mindful to the students need to de-stress and prepare for the upcoming school year as a student-designed project would.

Finally, students should design their summer project because they are able to create something everyone will love, they get the chance to think creatively, and they reduce the stress that comes with a summer assignment. If students are given the chance design the summer project the students will come back to school having better learned the material they were given.

But this overuse of cars is starting to have a negative effect on our environment and is causing mass traffic jams that put cities on halt. We as a society must start limiting our car usage to help save our environment and to stop traffic jams that do not let the city run smoothly.

Cars were and still are one of the best inventions man has ever made, so it is understandable why people would have such a hard time letting go of something that is so useful. But one must understand that although the car is useful it is also hurting other things, whether it be inadvertent or not. Cars have always been bad on the environment, now so more then ever. According to In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars passenger cars are responsible for 12 % of greeenhouse emissions and up to 50% in some car intensive areas in the United States. This shows that we as a society are one the of the main reasons why are environment is crumbling around us. These greenhouse emissions and mass pollution by cars are hurting the environment whether we want it to or not. Everybody must take a look at these numbers and see the negative effect they are having on the environment and realize that by simply not using a car they can help save the environment. Another example of the bad effects cars have on the environment can be found in the article Paris bans driving due to smog.

In the article it talks about how Paris had to enforce a driving ban due to the amount of pollution in the air from cars. The fact that a driving ban had to be implemented to stop pollution is absolutley ridiculous. This alone should show people that refuse to see the negative effects they are having on the environment around them that car usage should and must be cut down. By simply cutting down our usage of cars we as people can help save the environment. Who would not want to be a part of that?

Cars have always been viewed at as the best mode of transportation. Everyone believes that their car can always get them to the place they need the fastest. But what most people do not think about is the mass traffic jams in cities that the usage of cars can cause. If people simply cut down there car usage and try out other forms of transportation it actually could get them to the destination they want the quickest. An example of this can be found in the article Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota.

In the article it says when they banned cars for the day the huge traffic jams in the city suddenly went away. This allowed people on bikes and buses to actually get around quicker than they usually could with their cars. So by not using cars people actually got around to the places they needed to be due to the lack of traffic jams in the city.

The amount of cars driven on the road per day has risen to an astronomical number over the years. Although cars may be efficient they also have many harmful effects. Two of the worst are the effect they have on the environment and the mass traffic jams they cause. We as a society must recognize that by cutting down our usage of cars we can actually have a positive effect on our environment while also allowing ourselves the ability to bring traffic jams to a minimum.",0,0.0072685215,0,True

The opposite, in fact; the survival of that little habitat is becoming powerful on the thriving scale. Rosenthal intelegently implements the opinion of a mother of two in this article. The mother, Heidron  Walter, states "" When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Now, we can all agree that most moms usually have places to be prevalent to their children. As you can see, Haidron seems to be just fine. Not only is Haidron doing well, apparently, but she is now a source of the rehabilitation of this Earth.

Since we're in the area of Europe, what of the beauty and the capital of the world of love; Paris? Well, according to Robert Duffer's article on the pollution of Paris, there was a small outbreak of smog given off. In the very first sentence, I read a jaw-dropping sentnce that said ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" Looks like the beauty of Paris was lost. Dont' worry though, your honeymoons will still be available in this city, thanks to that partial ban. In fact, if the smog were to become more of a definite factor in the environment, then it would of broke the record in Paris for that particular reason. Sadly, that was not all that was concluded from this observation; "", after five-days of intensifying smog...[The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world,"" concluded Duffer. Incredibly, this did not occur due to the fact that cars were simply at the off position, which is a way of change that you and I can easily achieve.

Enough of the safety of the ozone layer, what about your safety in a car? Did you know that the percentage of you entering a car and driving inreases your chance of getting in a car crash? Pretty obvious but you never thouoght of it that way have you? Now, think of this but the statistic will be towards your child/future child. Everyday, a teenager dies of a head on collision. May it be a drinking problem, texting and driving, or a simple mistake, either way, someone has been lost that day. Families lose a big part of them, a future is lost, an education that could've been used one day. Gone. Rosenthal states in her article ""The End of the Car Culture"" that 23% of young people have stopped driving between the years of 2001-2009. If I was a father, I'd add on to that statistic of 23%, not the other statistic...

You may be a brother, a sister, a friend, a father, a mother, but you are human. As human, it is your responibilty to stop our foe, greenhouse gases and U.V light. The time of gasoline cars have ended and we have entered the era of higher, more environmentally friendly versions of cars. Thes cars are detteriorating the world with malice.

0BCB61C92C49,"Extracurricular activities may interest some students at schools, but not everyone likes the idea of doing things after school or during school. If the principal of your school decided that it was required for everyone to participate in at least one activity after school, would you be for or against it? I would be against this idea because many students have other things to do that are more important than activities like sports or yearbook staffs. Students may have rough times in their lives that require for them to attend to their family's needs, or it could be they are very busy and need time for other things like church or even family time, and finally students may have to make important, unscheduled trips if an emergency occurs.

Rough times in a students life sometimes makes them unable to attend certain school activities even if they are required by an administrator. It may be the students needs to work to pay for food, or the house needs to be cleaned because the parents are working overtime. No matter what the principal may say, family is much more important than a meager after-school activity. Any occurrence in a students life that requires they be home to help is completely understandable, and they should get the full support of the school.

Being overloaded with work also contributes to the fact that students shouldn't need to be enrolled in after school activities. Homework is almost always given to students to test their knowledge and what they learned, this is a leading factor in being busy and unable to be part of a after-school activity. Church or non-school-related events also make extracurricular activities more difficult to be a part of. Family time and curfew also relate to unavailability for after-school events.

The unexpected can also contribute to a student being unable to participate in after-school activities. A family member may have been involved in a car crash or shooting, a loved one may pass away, or even a beloved pet can easily make extracurricular activities a big no to some students. Students may have to attend a funeral, or rush to the hospital to see a loved one. After-school activities makes this harder for the student.

In conclusion, students should not be required to be involved in extracurricular activities because students may have rough times in their lives that require for them to attend to their family's needs, or it could be they are very busy and need time for other things like church or even family time, and finally students may have to make important, unscheduled trips if an emergency occurs.

D176ABB06812,"""Can you imagine a time in the future when no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore?"" This seems to me like a bad idea. The driverless car, while having some good qualities, is overwhelmed with bad qualities. The risk and danger of driving would greatly increase due to the cars being more in control. Not only is this dangerous, but the cost of the vehicle will increase because the product is new and ""advanced"". When adding up the time being taken to drive a car rather than take a taxi, the taxi takes a greater amount of time to deal with. Some of the negative aspects of the driverless car are much greater in numbers than the positive.

The risk of the driverless car is much greater than the risk of simply driving oneself everywhere. Like taxis, putting your life in someone elses hands is always a greater risk. The driverless taxis just double the chances out wrecks considering that the car still has more kinks than anyone cares to recognize. In the reading, it was stated that the car can brake on it's own. While that could be seen as a convienience, it can also be seen as a danger. The car may brake when it's is not supposed to which could cause a wreck. The driverless cars are still not totally able to navigate through traffic with ease. Having a regular car seems to be the safer option, because the driver is in complete control.

The driverless car is much more costly to manage than a car controlled by the driver. The product is new, so the initial cost will be much higher. Also, the technology is supposed to be more convienient and user friendly. These positive aspects always seem to cost more than a regular car. The driverless car will have such a large initial cost, the owner of the car will be owing the company in which he bought it money for a long time.

It always seems more convienient to take a taxi rather than drive yourself in a big city. In larger cities, taxi services are found everywhere, but in smaller towns the number of taxi's are much smaller. It is unneccisary to take a taxi in smaller town because the traffic is more manageable. The taxi services are only needed for large cities to handle all of the traffic. The new driverless cars are still not managable on their own in high areas of traffic.

The number of cons seems to outweigh the pros. Safety is always a big issue to everyone because it is important that everyone is safe at all times. As the world progresses money seems to be more of an issue. Driverless cars are seemingly too expensive to buy in the first place, let alone the price of gas being a taxi service. The convienience of a taxi is always so pleasant until they are unneccisary, like in smaller areas. Personally, the driverless cars just seem to have too many negative qualities to be worth production. ",0,0.0076568117,0,True

My name is STUDENT_NAME. I agree on policy two, that there should be no cell phones allowed in school.

I think that if we would choose policy one, students wouldn't obey the policy. Even though Students would enjoy using their cell phones at lunch and other free-times, they would most likely sneak their phones and text during a lesson in class. Also, if the school allowed cell phones, students might forget to turn their phone off, and it would ring. The ringing cell phone would be a distraction to other students, disabling learning. I don't think students need to be using their cell phones at lunch and other free time because most of their friends that they would text or call would be in the same room.

If we chose policy two, there wouldn't be any distractions because there wouldn't be any cell phones at all.

What is more important? Having students not be able to use their cell phones during free time, or students not being able to learn because of cell phone distractions? Students not being able to learn is more important, and that is why I choose policy two, to have no cell phones in school at all.

Because of LOCATION_NAME I want to visit there, but this is not the only reason I want to meet my friends and family in India, and I want to enjoy the tasty food, and I also want to see LOCATION_NAME in Generic_City.

Firstly, the reason why I want to go to India is because my friends and my family lives there. India is my home country I grew and study there. Family and friends are important. I miss them all. I still remember my last day at school . Did you have that experience that you really like someone, but you have to leave them? It is not good when your family or friend leave you. Next, The problems I face when I come to U.S.A. I had some language problems. I do not want to go to school because I did not had any friends. To sum up, family and friends are important to make sure that you do not feel alone.

Secondly,I want to go to India because

I think Indian street stalls have tasty and spice food. One day, I was in front of super market and there was a burger stall called NFC they have the best burgers in the world. After, eating our burger my dad ask for bill and it was so cheep. I love that place if you visit India go and try that place. Finally, I love the taste of Indian street stalls and they are cheep.

Lastly, I want to learn how to dance because every one have their own thing, and I want to proof that if we are different that means we are unique.

you were on my place would you like to tell them about your country. If people say that,""Your country is not good.''

The thought of computers being able to read expressions is pretty fasinating, however seem unnessisary. Like hummans computers make mistakes; the Facial Action Coding System could inaccutartly change a lesson plan, missread an expression, or not pick up an expression .

At school students do get bored, but the teacher does not change the lesson plan so why should the computer. All the evidence is a prediction with no hard evidience backing it; ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts"". In class students ask questions or go to a teacher when they do not get it so a computer would not be much of a help unless it was for kids who did online school and did not have a teacher helping them through the lessons.

Most students are not nessisarly excited about school so they quite regularly wear a bored expression throughout the day. Not to mention ""each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no expression)"". Some kids just do not show emotion especialy older kids who just want to get what needs to be done finished. What if a kid is genuinly confussed and the computre missreads the expression. that could either cause more confussion as the lesson goes on or make the lesson too easy.

Computers make errors all the time they are no where near perfection. What if the computer does not have the sennsors to pick up expression. It is not like every school or home schooled student is going to go out and buy a computer that can do the same thing a parent or teacher can do. This invention ""stores similar anatomical information as electronic code"". The Facial Action Coding System is amazing to show expressions in art work, but not for students.

While coputres do aid us at many things there are somethings that should just be left to us to do. Students get confused and bored by many things but that can all be fixed by a little bit of help. If the student is really that confused then maybe that program is not for them. As well as if the student does not show emtion while doing work on the computer.

Dr. Huag and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. They can caculate Emotions like a math homework. How can a computer recognize subtile facial movements we humans use to Express ourselves.

Then it gets into Facial Expressions that could be recognized. In this paragraph it said ""you can probably tell how a friend is feeeling simply by the look on their face"". Some people havr a natural mean look and some have no expression. Dr. Huag predicts that a calssroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming bored or confused. He says the same technology can make computer amimated faces more expressive live video games, video surgery.

While looking in the mirror they give instrctions on how to make a smile. 1. Raise your lips at the corners of your mouth. 2. Then squint your eyes slightly, they will like like crows feet at the corner of your eye. 3. Hold all of that and then raise the outer parts of your cheeks up towards your eye.

Cars should be put to limited usage becuase cars are a leading factor in air pollution. Also limited car usage is helpful because it can help you stay healthy and in shape.

Cars should be put to limited usage because cars are a leading factor in air pollution.

Like it says in source 1 ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe . . . and up to 50 percent in some car-intense areas in the United States."" Cars release gases into the air which cause pollution. The pollution is bad for the enviroment and for civilians health. Like this one time in Paris the pollution form cars got so bad it created a smog over the city. After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced driving ban to clear the area of the global city. Citezens of Paris were fined if they were seen driving during the ban, only some cars were abke to be driving on specific days. Just after a few days of this ban the smog cleared enough for a vehicles were able allowed to drive.  To reduce this we must do what a few cities around the world do. Some small cities around the world are reducing car usage by creating more accesible public transportation methods, with less parking space. Also the stores are placed on a walk way, on a main street rather than in malls which are far away.

Also, cars should be put to limited usage because it can help you stay healthy and in shape. If you dont use cars you be forced to walk or to ride a bike. Doing this will be physical activity and help you stay in shape. You wont have to sit in a car and just press a pedal to move. That will get you lazy and fat. If you ride a bike instead or walk you are moving and naking your body work, keeping yourself from being fat and staying healthy.

In conclusion, car usage should be limited becuase cars are a leading factor in air pollution and also limited car usage is helpful because it can help you stay healthy and in shape.      ",0,0.006454365,0,True

I think that performing community service is a good idea and it is very significant to do so. The reason why i say that performing community service is important and that it is a good idea is because it could teach the youth how to be more involved with their community and it could teach a valuable lesson to them. For example, picking up the trash off of the ground, could teach the youth that it causes less pollution and that it could be very generous of them to do so. pollution can mess up people's community and i know that the children wouldn't want that at all. Performing community service doesn't take up too much time. it could only take up a small portion of someone's time

Requiring this performance would help out the communities and would put smiles on everyone's faces. It could get children to be off of their electronics and other things that they value, and get a taste of learning and helping out their communities. I really think that it would brighten up people's lives and cause for people to be happy. Once all the cleaning up is done or whatever the topic is, is finished, children could go outside and play ride their bikes, jump rope, or anything they want to do. Helping out the community could cause a big improvement.

Do not just do this for me, but do it for those who want a better community and those who want to see a change. I think that you would be proud of those who want to volunteer and help out with the community services. I hope that with all of this in mind, you make the right decision because once you make your final decision, there is no turning back. You have to realize that being involved and helping out with your community is very important and special to me. I hope and pray that you choose wisely and understand those point of views who want to help out with and be involved with community service.

CD7860A8F65C,"Students wouldn't benefit from taking classes at home or online. Most people who take online school have jobs and families they need to worry about so that why online is so successful for adults over the age of thirty. Most online school caters to adults who are have jobs but still want to get their education in timely but inexpensive manner. Though the concept of school is a hands on experience meant for learning, practicing social skills, that focuses on core values and ethics that every kid should endorse.

School has been a concept forever intertwined with the modern day man. Controversy about schooling is constantly making headlines in the public eye, whether it be about a head masters lying or schools giving out one thousand dollar scholarships. Public schools help us reflect on what we have achieved over the hundreds and thousands of years, whether that be basic math, science, writing, or history. Some people could argue that they understand a class enough not to attend, but it costs more to do online than it does to do public. Though not all countries have a free educational system that tries to be supportive of the lower class not being able to pay. Normally payment is at the beginning of every year and is fairly cheap compared to what it could be in other countries.

It can be argued that with the growing teenage population, more disrespect is shown in school, thus making students not want to attend certain classes. School has given every chance they have to show us that there will be people in the real world who won't care about your ability to get your work done if they are distraction to you. Being introduced to other people at a young age prepares us that we can't just think for ourselves anymore and always remember that people can be affected by what you do. When taking online classes the ability to communicate with others about how you got an answer isn't there just because you didn't want to be in a loud class. In math you can use different equations to get the same answer but some are easier than others, but without the other students their it complicates thing by making you learn one way and no other.

Core values have been an important issue that kids ,especially teenagers, are forgetting. we pick up core values and ethics from the people around us and what we emerce our selfs into to on the TV. If someone doesnt hang around a lot of people then they won't be as sympathetic or understand how to act when a situation happens.

The benefit a student would get from online school wouldn't really be a benefit but would be a crutch. A child shouldn't have a reason to stay home all day and take the classes at home. Social skills that are required for day to day life would end up being forgotten, learning wouldn't be as unique as it is in a real classroom, and a set of morals would only be tailored for that individual instead to thinking about how others would feel.",0,0.0073663658,0,True

So now you have to stay after school and cant go home until another two hours! I disagree with this decision to make all students participate in at least one extracurricular activity because kids have chores, homework, some kids dont even like sports, and we might have other plans.

The first reason I disagree with this decision is because some students dont like sports. Students should'nt be forced to do something they dont want to do. Some kids arent good at sports or they just dont like sports, but either way they shouul'nt be forced to play them, its not fair. Also, if students are staying after school to do an extracurricular actvity they wont have any time to do homework or chores.

Unless NASA sends a couple astronauts out to the moon, traveling to any other planet is not something a person would be used to hearing everyday. Imagine going to a planet where it is surrounded by a carbon dioxide atmosphere and a corrosive sulfuric acid atmosphere combined. While it only gets up to a little over 100 degrees in many places aorund the world in the summer, this planet gets over 800 degreees Fahrenheit year round. Obviously, it seems impossible to live there without dying immediately. But, isn't that why we have spacecrafts to go off and do missions? Many spacecrafts only make it a few hours when sent to this planet, making it nearly impossible. Surprisingly enough, this planet is known as Venus. Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density, size and distance, which makes sense why so many scientists and employees at NASA are so interested in studying Venus.

Venus is known as Earth's sister planet. Earth being very similar to Venus, Venus is extremely different in ways it is hard for a human being to imagine. But, once upon a time, Venus was more Earth-like than ever before. It was covered in large oceans with a suitable way for forms of life to live there. Today, Venus has some similarities, such as a surface of rocky sediment and has valleys, mountains, and craters. Being so similar to Earth, scientists decided to take up on diving deeper in the world of Venus. Venus has an incredible amount of dnager, which is why NASA has options for making the mission safe but also scientifically productive.

One of several options would be to send humans to study Venus floating above the fray. With this option, the humans would be able to survive, but still have to go through 170 degree temperatures. An obvious disadvantage to floating above the fray would be the distance barrier. It is very hard to collect samples of rock, gas, or photos from that far of a distance. Rendering standard forms of photograph and videography become ineffective because floating from such a distance provides limited insight.

The right but more difficult path to take would be figuring out a way to reach ground level on Venus. Not impossible, researchers are working on innovations that would let the machines last long enough to contribute meaningfully to get more knowledge on Venus. Some of the simplified electronics are made of silicon carbid and have also been tested in some of the extreme dangers that Venus has. A second similar machine would have been similar to mechanical computers used base in the 1940s during World War II. These type of devices make calculations by using gears and levers without the need of electronics. Today's modern technology would be fragile to be able to sustain any type of conditions in Venus, although it is way easier and faster to use modern day technology for this specific challenge.

Having danger limit the human brain is one of the ""easier said than done"" situations. After a while, humans will become to curious and will want to know more about Venus and about all of the dangers that come with it. There is no other way to figure these things out other than figuring out a way to see all of it for ourselves. Using our curiousity, researchers and those who work at NASA might be able to create new innovations or ways to see all of the dangers that are within the scary planet of Venus.",0,0.0074071144,0,True

There are many outgoing students, but there are also many introverted students. Some students may not feel confident enough to ask for something to be repeated, so they may simply sit at their desks puzzeled for the rest of the class, while a simple question could've avoided this. If this technology is instituted, it will automatically know when a student isn't confident on the information and alert the teacher. By doing this, the introverted student won't be confused for very long and the topic could be revisited without the student to have to personally ask. It not only will help introverted students, but students across the board. Every student will benifit form this technology and will display in their grades. With this technology, the students acedemic achievements will expand exponentially. Becuase of this ability for teachers to understand their emotions, the quick turn around of revisiting the topic and teaching it a little differently could help the students absorb all the information, especially the information that they mau have not conprehended initally. This technology will be very valuable for the students for both their enjoyment throughout school becuase of the reduced stress, and their improvents in acedemic grades.

This technology is not only bennifical to the students, but to the teacher as well. For the teacher they will automatically know if a student is struggling and in what topic. Thius could be very valuable to create a strong teacher studnent realtionship where the teacher is able to understant the smallest change in emotion to when they're confused or if they understamd it. This relationship could improving the learning environment and how comfortable a student with their students and peers. This technology could help teachers in both big and small schools. In big lecture halls, it may seem to be difficult for a professor to understand the emotions of all the students sitting before them, they might not even be able to see everyone because some may sit further away. With this new technology, teachers could be notified when some students become confused and then revisit a topic. Small classrooms could benifit greatly to this as well. Althought they are in a closer proximity then in lecture halls, they still will have the issue of not understanding the emotions which could lead to confusion. In smaller classrooms the teacher could know what they're doing wrong and be able to fix this easily without having to disturb the students. They can evaluate the emotions throughout the lesson and then later, they can change their lesson plans to adapt to the confusion of the students. This is again, a very valuable piece of technology that could help the teachers grow in their profession.

Initally one may think that this technology is redundant and that a teacher could just help the student, and that it may be invading the students privacy. In reality, this technology continues to prove its many values, and it's evergrowing amount of benifits that completly overpower all the ideas that some may think its unnimportant. This technology is valuable to both teachers and students equally. The teachers are able to improve their teaching techniques and the students understand more in school. This technology, however, is nowhere near done. This technology can be further improved in many aspects. I could keep improving and always creating a smarter version of the present day technology, that may one day, change the course of education forever. This could be implemented in the online schools to understand if a student comprehends the information the value of this is unspeakable and should be institued in classrooms globally.

8F13AAF260A1,"Dear Principal,

I think that we should not change the policy so that you can only play sports if you have a B average. I think that many students and parents will complain about this for similar reasons that I have. I also think that if this policy goes into effect then their will be very few people on the various sports teams and the teams would not be as good.

I have many reasons for why I don't think that this policy should go into effect. My main reason is that a lot of the people who are very athletic and good at almost all sports have trouble concentrating in a classroom because they just want to be out doing something, anything. I think that if you took away the ability for them to play sports with their friends from school, the majority of the kids would start to do even worse in the classroom because they just don't care anymore. Yes, some would work harder to get better grades, but who knows if they even could. They probable have never really tried before, so it would be a great struggle for them.

Another of my big reasons is that as the Principal of our school, you should care about how the different sports teams are doing in their various seasons. If the kids who were better at sports could not play because their grades weren't so hot, then the teams would probably be not very good or their would be no team at all because there were not enough people to play on the team. Then the kids who did want to play would not get the chance to and then them and their parents would be mad at the school and you.

My last reason is, who would coach? All of the good coaches are generally a parent of one of the kids on the team, one of the good kids on the team. So if all the kids who were good at that sport could not play, then their parent would not want to coach if their kid wasn't on the team.

So as you can see it is a very bad idea to change the policy to a B average instead of a C average. There are many rock solid reasons not to change the policy above. I advise you to read over them thoroughly and make your decision. Please make the right choice, and remember if the knew policy does go into effect then it won't just be me that you are hearing from.

Sincerely,

There are all kinds of different places you go when you are a Seagoing Cowboy. There are also some jobs you have to do like cleaning out the stables and feeding the animals, but it is a lot of fun.

The text states "" He knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime."" It will make you feel free being on a boat. The Part that is the best is getting to see all the wounderful sights. You could go to China, Italy, Greece, and other places. When you are a Seagoing Cowboy you can exlpore different places of the world. You get to meet different people and see how their coulture is different.

The second best thing is all the free time you have after the animals get droped off. The text states, "" The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time."" There are all kinds of games you can play, so you will not be bored.

It is fun getting to interact with people from different cultures. It is also really cool to be on a boat with your friends and animals. All you have to do is clean out the animals housing area and give them food and water. You also get to interact with the animals when you feed and water them.

7B279795EF91,"Have you ever been trying to pay attention in class but your friends or someone in your class is being a major distraction? Or have you been following the teachers orders but your teacher is moving at a faster pace than you can learn? Some students have these problems in public schools so I'm going to be explaining the reasons why students learning at their own pace without any distractions at home will benefit more than students learning in a public school.

One reason I believe students will benefit more from doing work at home is because they won't get distracted from other students who mess around a lot during class. Students messing around could cause other students to get distracted and not focus on their work or what the teacher is trying to lecture. If they were getting educated online at home, they wouldn't get distracted by anyone because they're alone. Being alone at home in a one on one conversation between the teacher and the student wouldn't cause any distractions for the student.

Another reason I believe students would benefit by being taught online rather than in a public school is because teachers teach at a class pace and there are some students out there that can't learn at a class pace so they fall behind and have to catch up on work later. If the student were getting taught at home, they can go at any pace they want and won't fall behind. Not falling behind will be really beneficial to students because some get really stressed out when they have a lot of work to do.

My final reason on why students being taught at home would benefit them more than students being taught at public schools is that they will get a good understanding of the curriculum. In public schools, you could possibly get a teacher that you dont like or one that can't teach well. This could cause you to not understand what the teacher is lecturing. If the student was taking the class online, they would get a teacher that they would like or they would just learn the material themselves by reading.

Taking school online at home does have down sides such as not getting much public speaking skills which could cause some people to be anti-social but thats easy to overcome. Not getting distracted, learning at your own pace, and getting a teacher that you like are some of many of the reasons why I believe that students being taught online would benefit more than students being taught in a public school. ",0,0.008026472,0,True

People wished that they could of done something to change what they do for a living and do something they will be truly happy with. There are people who are sad and deperessed on the job they have now. It takes time,focus, and motivation for a student to find the career they truly would want to take in the future.

Not everyone is the same there are people who need a long period of time to find out what they would want there career to be. Students might love to do multiple things but cant find out which one to do as there career. Sometimes the students needs to have the experiance and see how it is with there own experiance. Students should not be pushed and forced to pick a career so quickly. Not everyone is able to be like that.

Not most students can afford the right education for the carrer they are being forced to take; therefore the whole time the high schools have been forcing them and guiding them towards a specific career it would all have been a wast of time because they could of not afford the right education for that career. If student are being forced in studying a career they dont want to do and then cant afford the right education to do that they are going to be unhappy and they will b forced to go downhill to a job they would never imagine them doing. And in doing so when they are doing something that they never imagined themselves doing then depression and regret will start happening.

With the job they are being forced into doing they might not be able in doing it. For example if a student is being forced in a scientific field of learning but they know that science isnt there strong suit they will have a hard time and start having a hard time in that field. Students know what is best for them and know what will benifit them and find a path that would be best for there needs.

Some people might say that having students pick a career at a young age will help them in the future because it will give them more time so strengthen that career and become very good at it. What people dont understand is that some students might not be intersted in that and would want something they would b happy with so they can improve on the stuff they know they are good at and have alot of skill in.

C43C4C50427E,"Imagine being on a vacation in the Bahama's and realize that you have to finish two book reports by the end of the trip. Now your vacation is totally ruined! You now are going to have to postpone relaxing and having fun, because you have to do school work before classes even start. The majority of schools around the country include summer learning assignments; which purposes as a way to help students get ready for their upcoming classes. This could included a genre of ideas of work to be assign that teachers could choose from. Most student's don't enjoy these projects; since, most kids don't want to start thinking about school until, the doors are open again. They would usually prepare you at a younger age with summer reading to help the gradual adjustment to essays, projects, and many more, easier to do. The issue is that, more and more students forget or never finish, these summer homework assignments, due to the lack of enjoyment or increased procrastination. So if you could choose your own project, would it be more likely that you would complete it?

If students could create their own homework assignments, what would it look like? A student could choose topics such as, sports, television, friends, family, location, or anything else that they could think of. Maybe if teachers assigned essays over break, students could choose what to write about. For instance, maybe they would like to explain what they did during summer or, describe their favorite sport, food, TV show, and even create a bibliography about themselves. I know that many students still wouldn't enjoy writing or reading over their summer vacation; but, what if a student could choose to do anything they wanted, instead of writing. They could make a picture collage, poster, PowerPoint, painting, or whatever they'd want, to show how their vacation is going or why they like a particular topic. If your school let you pick what to work on during break, what would you choose?

Why do students prefer not to do these assignments in the first place? What are teachers asking kids to do that's so uninteresting? Since you started enrolling in school, your teachers would choose to give you work during summer break. This was to help kids be more comfortable before starting the following school year. It usually starts with summer reading to help lead up to research projects or essays. If you're about to start entering AP classes, you're more likely to have more difficult assignments. If you're not taking an honor or AP class, it's less likely you're going to be given summer projects. Kids could tend do be less interested due to amount or difficulty they're given. What's the hardest assignment your teachers given you?

The real question is, how could we persuade school districts to allow these types of learning assignments? My school's county has social media accounts such as,

Instagram and twitter , that will inform parents, faculty, staff, and students, important messages about our community. If your school has a social media account, try to contact them or research your suggestion so you could to see if your idea could even be possible. Getting a message back from a schools social media account, can be harder then finding the answers you were looking for online. You could always ask a teacher, guidance councilor, or anyone at your school, to help you with any of your issues, including learning suggestions. If I was in this position, I would tweet at my county's twitter or direct message them, to try to get the answers I'm looking for.

At last it's 2020, and our goal on easier summer projects, hasn't gotten the attention it deserves. We have self driving cars and miniature robots to plan, remind, and clean for ourselves; but, we can't make school work more comfortable for summer. If we want to show our country that there's an easier way to prepare ourselves for school, we need to create an impressive thought out plan. We can figure out our main idea and focusing points, to later show our school counties all over the country, how important this subject is.

FC6F09041098,"I think you should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program because it will feel great to help animals in need. From my experience of being a Seagoing Cowboys felt amazing because I was able to go to Greece and had a cargo filled with 335 horses plus hay and oats to feed them. I had to feed and water them three times a day. Even though it takes a long time to get from place to place, keeping the animals healthy made me feel happy for me and everbody who participated. That's why I think you should participate in this program.

First, If you become a Seagoing Cowboy it could be fun from time to time. When we were still on a cattle-boat trip, I was able to see Europe and China on the way. Another thing that was fun was that one time me and the crew played volleyball and baseball games where the animals had been housed. Other times we would have table-tennis, fecing, and boxing tournaments to help pass the time. So that may be a thing to enjoy while you are a Seagoing Cowboy.

Next, When you are a Seagoing Cowboy it may open up the world to you like it did to me. From my experience, it made me more aware of people and their needs. So after the long adventure, I had lead my family to host a number of international students and echange visitors for many years. This program had mad me become a better person so, I can help people and their needs. I hope you will do the same too.

Then, when you are a Seagoing Cowboy sometimes it can be intersting but, other times it can be painful. One time when I was being a watchman, I had to watch the animals every hour to make sure they didn't wake up. When I went to make my hourly report to the captain, I had slipped on my backside when I went down a slippery ladder. That day I was lucky to be alive because a small strip of metal stopped me from going into the dark Altantic but I couldn't work due to my cracked ribs. I hope when you become a Seagoing Cowboy, you would not make the same mistake that I did.

Finally, from this huge experience of my life, I had enjoyed it for the most part. From the beginning, I started out as a a simple man then become a Seagoing Cowboy. This is why I highly encouraged you to become a Seaboy Cowboy becuase of all the experiences and fun you can have if you join.

78EEA7477151,"Some schools implement a summer project to continue the flow of learning, and to ensure that the students' brains retain learned information. When asked to take a position on whether students or teachers should design these projects, I chose both sides. The reasoning behind my decision was quite simple: one side is more knowledgeable when it comes to the information, and has years of experience in teaching on their side. However, nobody knows the experience of living as the secondary group more than they themselves do, so it makes sense that they would have a part in this idea.

Allow me to begin by playing devil's advocate against my own thinking. One may refute my statements with the simple argument of, ""Well, students don't know how to teach, so why should they have a part in this?"". One may also describe my thinking as ineffective by stating along the lines of, ""Well, nobody knows how to plan exciting experiences better than the ones who have to endure them"". Now, both these arguments are well rooted and difficult to counter, however that in and of itself is what lends them to my cause. The first argument supports the idea that teachers are more experienced, thus more prepared to enact such ideas and projects; the second argument then supports my secondary belief, that the students better know themselves, and can lend more than a simple helping hand in the creation of such activities.

Now that I have finished counter-arguing and rebutting, I can begin my statements. I would like to begin with the teachers. My standing on the subject is that teachers are more experienced and better suited to plan the informational aspects of a summer's project. Why, if a student knew the subject matter well enough to plan such an activity, and knew how to best teach and explain it, then they would be in no need of a project or a teacher! Yes, it is the job of the teacher to... well, teach, and it is the job of the student to learn. However, this does not exclude the student from the planning process all together.

The student is quite important, because they are the target audience. They will know, better than anyone, how to reach out and grab hold of their demographic. The student knows what is fun, boring, enticing, and annoying to them as a whole. While it is true that not all students are made equal, and what is fun to one may be dull to another, a democratic poll can be issued to help even the playing field. Alternatively, multiple projects can be issued out to different types of student, or a simple skeleton plan may be issued, with which the students may piece together their own project. Perhaps all three can be issued as a choice, with students choosing which ""flavor"" of project they would find easiest to follow. Yes, the student is an important piece to project design, with the teacher serving a bigger part in project management. Let the demographic choose their product.

As I finish, allow me to restate my core ideas. The teacher is an important utility in the informational and managerial parts of a summer project; however, the student plays just as important a role in the design and creational aspects. Both sides are nearly equal in importance, and choosing just one as the end all be all is not dissimilar to how American politics are carried out. Yes, it is important to have a fair balance of both sides, with each person playing to their specific strengths. Too much equality and you have a democracy that will never move forwards. Too much freedom and you have a form of communism in which there is no order to help guide everyone to the correct paths. Yes, a balance is much needed; a balance, mind you, that will never be truly found.

How can extracurricular activites be benefical to students?

Have you ever wondered why people try excurricular activites? Extracurricular activites are often before or after school or even on the weekends. Some examples of extracurricular actiivities are sports or clubs. I agree that it would be benefical for students to be in at least one extracurricular activity because it can help boost students mental health, improve social skills and be given a chance to try new things.

The first reason why it would be benefical for students to be in at least one extracurricular activity is because it can help boost students mental health. Studies have shown that more excercise is benefical and improves overall mood. Extracurricular activitives,especially sports, have a physical component that gives students the chance to be active. Being active has shown in studies that it improves sleep cycles and overall improves mental health. Being in a extracurricular activity can help boost mental health.

The second reason why it would be benefifical for students to be in at least one extracurricular activity is because it can help improve social skills. Making friends doesn't come easy to everyone and joining an activity can give students the chance to meet new people. Joining an extra activity can introduce you to many people who over time, will get to know you and possibly want to become friends. Being a part of an extracurricular activity can help you meet new people and can make it eaiser to make friends or just talk to people in general. An extracurricular activity can help imporve social skills.

The third reason why it would be benefical for students to be in at least one extracurricular activity is because it can give students the chance to try new things. All activites have a main focus like soccer or art club, but all activites have a little thing they do that is unique. Having the chance to be part of a club is a new thing in itself and you should take advantage of that try a new thing. Being in an extracirricular activity can give students the chance to try new things.

In conclusion, I agree that it would be benefical for students to be in at least one extracurricular activity because it can help boost students mental health, improve social skills and be given a chance to try new things. School is a chance to try new things. So take advantage of the oppurtinites that you are given to try something and see how it goes.

I think the policy should allow us to have cell phones. There are certain reasons why. But i also think that if students get carried away using them until the fact that they use them during class that they should take them away from the people using them at that time and return them at the end of the day. I only like to be fair because I would love the chance to get to have my cell phone out. I will explain more about why i think this in the paragraphs below.

Lots of people get sick at school and need to go home. Some people stay in the restrooms and call or text their parents to come get them but the calling noises always bring attention to teachers and you usually get it took. If your sick and have no way to call your parents from the office then you should be able to call or text from where ever you are. But if it comes to a point where people are skipping class to go text then they should take that privilege away.

Almost everyone has a cell phone and love to text their friends. But when it comes to the no cell phone policy at school well trust me I understand. hours without calling or texting is like a day without happiness. You hear all these other kids calling and texting in class but don't get caught, then you try it and you get caught and your phone gets took by the teacher. You could never understand why that happens so of course you feel like your trapped without your cell phone.

The no cell phone policy is unfair in my opinion. We all love our cell phones and never want to have to put them up. This is why I am agreeing to the policy allowing cell phones in free time and not in class. No student likes to give up their cell phone. And I completely understand them.

I disagree with the new school policy you are trying to change because it isn't fair to the students of your school. It isn't fair that you want to change the sports activity unless these students have a grade B average. Many of the students that are involved in these sports activity have a grade C average. If they don't have a grade B average they are not allowed to participate in these school activities. It would be very hard for them to keep up with a B average for the rest of the year.

Not many students would be able to be in these after school activities because of their grade average. You wouldn't have that many students in your sports activity either if they don't have a B average. It's not fair to change the school policy now that you only have a C average.

These students who are in these activities would not be able to be in them anymore. Some students might be very good at some sports and they would not be able to join because of the new school policy you are trying to be approved.

If you do change it, it won't be fair to the other students who try to keep that average and still be able to be in the schools activities. For some students it take a while to learn a new topic and they might be really good at something else. They would not know because they wouldn't be able to try out for that sport. They might even have a C average and they wouldn't be able to be in that sports because they might have not succeeded at having a B average.

For other students they are not just good at sports; some have a talent at other things like art. But they would not be able to at least try to be in an art club because you have change the school policy. Only students that really good at their school work would be able to join these activities that they are good at.

Once again if you do change this new school policy you would be unfair to the students and you would not be giving them a chance by not letting them participate at what they might be best at the most. For some students they might not have been able to keep such a high average for these students.

437E9376FB71,"Nobody is perfect. Making better decisions is something that all people can strive for. It is important that you ask for other people's opinions when you need help making a decision. The average person would say that they would take back a decision or choice they made in the past or would want to change something. The choices we make each day affect our lives going forward and for our own sake, we need to make better choices. Getting advice from multiple people can help you to avoid personal bias, see from new perspectives, and get help from qualified people.

When being tasked to make an important decision, it is important that you avoid personal bias and take other people's ideas and thoughts into account. People with biased minds often already have a decision in mind before making a decision and usually will not change their mind. In order to avoid bias and make the right choice, you have to think about all the outcomes to all decisions and ponder each one. For example, when betting on a sports team to win a game, you must think about how realistic your preferred outcome is. People who are fans of one team often bet that they will win even though that possibility is highly unlikely. Everybody has a personal bias and it is matter of controlling it. Seeking other people's opinions can help you to be unbiased and make the right decision, rather than making the more personally favorable one. Finally, allowing your mind to be clouded and biased will not help you make a better choice.

Asking for advice or opinions from others can help you see from a new perspective. When viewing a decision from others opinions, you may learn new information and realize things that you had not before. When I make a decision, I ask my parents, siblings, and friends for advice because I want to see what type of lens they are viewing my decision from. Depending on what they may say, my thoughts, ideas, and choice may all change. Seeing from other people's view may spark your imagination to think of a new choice or to understand that a certain choice is bad. Not trying to see from another point of view or believe that your choice is wrong is like having tunnel vision, one dimensional and myopic. Being able to see from multiple different perspectives can help you to make the best choice because it is not always your own or your best friend's perspective that is the best.

Getting advice from other people can help when making a decision because they may be more knowledgeable or experienced on a topic. It is important to listen to these people because they have a better understanding on the possible outcomes, pros, and cons. Conversely, you should take the advice of someone who is less knowledgeable or is less experienced on a topic into account less. For example, asking your friend who has a bad grade in science class for help on homework is not a good idea. Asking your parents, siblings, or a friend that is very good at science is a better choice. Next, people who are more experienced and have made the right or wrong decision in the past are also people that can help you make better choices because they can tell you first-hand what to do in certain scenarios. When needing to know whether you should take a class over the summer or not, asking someone who has already been in the class will have a better understanding on if you should or should not than yourself or someone who has not taken the class. The advice of more qualified people should be searched for when trying to make the best choice.

Each day you make hundreds of choices and each choice you make effects more than just yourself. They effect your parents, siblings, peers, etc. It is important that we all try to make the best choice possible each day. Asking others for their thoughts, opinions, and advice on what you should do is critical. You must avoid your personal bias when making choices, try to see things from a new perspective and take in the wisdom of someone who is more knowledgeable and experienced than you into account. Seeking multiple opinions can help you make a better choice.",0,0.8465589,1,False

Limmiting car usage is starting to become the next big focus and some people have found some benifical advantages to the limit of car usage. It would reduce the emission of green house gases greatly. Businesses would see a tremedious profit because of people walking. Although, some people would'nt like this at all because it would take more time to get to one place, they still could car pool or even get some exersice by walking or riding a bike.

Green house gags has become a huge concern because it is destroying our atmosphere! In source 1, Elisabeth Rosental explains that passenger cars make up 50 percent of the green house gags in the United States and that just the cars! If we would limit our usage of car then we could reduce margin so muh all we have to do is find a more efficent way of transportation. In source 3, Andrew Selsky write about how Bogtoa had a car free day and Carlos Arturo says ""it was a good opportunity to take away the stress and lower air pollution."" So not only would we be helping save our atmosphere but we would be saving ourselves from stress of diving.

Businesses strive on bring in customes so they can make profit. If we would reduce the the usage of cars then customers wouldnt be problem for business men because people would be walking or riding bike and usally will stop for something to eat or even stop to look inside a shop while on there way to their destination. It would help the communites economy boost.

Some people might disagree on the idea of tring to cut the car usage rate because it will take a longer time to get some where. However, they could still car pool or even ride a bike and get some exerscie. Also, reducing car usage would help people become more social in their life. They could meet new people and get to know some one if they would ride the public bus. In source 4, Elisabet Rosenthal explains how accients from cars are a mjor cause of death but its so unsafe when you get out on the road. Reducing car usage has many advantages for our live to stress free and safe.

Deminishing car usages has many positive changes to our lives and to our planet. for exapmle, with less cars we would have less pollution being emitted into the air which i killing the atmosphere as we speak, people would be happier with less cars because they dont have to stress over driving and paying full attention on the road and conditions. Less cars would have a more social effect on the live of humans. The positive advantages on reducing car usage are endless!    ",0,0.0065126843,0,True
434145A7D215,"Projects over the summer? Seems unreal to adults, but the students are the ones who have to complete the project. All of the projects are normally teacher designed and are made to challenge the students, which benefits the students in the long run. If a student, or body of students was to design the project that the entire school would have to complete, it would most likely be too easy and would be completed in a matter of a week or two. These students also have no experience in designing a project, as the teachers do this for a living, so having a student design it, the project would be much too easy and would make no sense at all. So, teachers should always be the ones who design summer projects for the high school students.

If students designed a project that they were supposed to complete, they would make it too easy. Why would a student(s) design a project that they have to complete at some point throughout the summer, and make it insanely hard for themselves and other students? In fact, they would not, they would make the project or assignment simple and short for ease of completion. When a student goes on break he or she will not want to do anything but have fun, and by having a project this would eliminate part of the fun. So, if a student designed it, they would make it work not only around their schedule, but also around their free time in order to have the most fun during break. If a teacher was to create the project, it would be long, hard, and complicated in order to make the students think and keep their brain working over the entirety of summer break. Which leads me to my next point, why have a student do it, when a teacher gets paid to do it, and do it well?

When a teacher has been creating material for students to do for his or her entire life, why switch to students to create this work? Well, we should not, having students create their own assignments would be pointless, as they have teachers to do it and assign the project to them for a living. Teachers know much more than students when it comes to designing any sort of work that gets assigned to the students. When a student designs an assignment it also adds even more work for them to do as well as more stress for the students, which can add up as time goes on, as there is only so much work a student can do at once. Teachers are also much better at designing projects that fit everyone in the class as the teacher knows how most people learn and how they learn the best, whether that be though working hands on, via audio, or visual learning. The teacher will always produce a better project, which is why teachers should stay making the assignments and students should continue to complete them without complaining. Also, would students not attempt to post-pone the completion of the design in order to cancel it altogether.

Via post-poning the entire design of the project, students would think that this would cancel the entirety of the project, which is false. This is another advantage of having a teacher design the project, he or she would most likely get the project designed and handed out to the students in a timely manor. This is something that most of the students would not be able to do, so having a student design it is not the best option. There could also be many setbacks and distractions for the students, like phones, jobs, friends, etc. All of these are examples of distractions that could set the project design back a lot. Although teachers could have the same problems, they are much more mature and know how to deal with the distractions as well as get work done at the same time. These are all reasons that the teachers would get the project designed in a more timely manor than the students.

Finally students would not be the best option for designing these summer projects because students would try to make it too easy, post pone the project design, as well as teachers get paid for this as it is their job. So, students would slack off and get little to no work done due to distractions, and clever ways to get out of designing and completing the project. So teachers should stay designing the project and this should not change for good reason as well.",0,0.008630141,0,True
3FA5AFBA302B,"Have you ever gtten your hopes up for something special, but you secretly knew you wouldn't get what you wanted? That is how some felt once they discovered the ""Face on Mars"" wasn't actually a face. Many convincing facts led NASA's employees to believe this natural landform was actually a human face. However, there just so happened to be a few more facts and pieces of evidence to tell otherwise.

In September of 1997, Cydonia became NASA's number one priority when Mars Global Surveyor arrived to the Red Planet. The article says this was eighteen long years after the Vikings missions ended. Jim Garvin explaines how they felt this landform was important to taxpayers and they photographed the Face as soon as they could get a good shot at it. Beacause this mysterious form exsited and NASA payed so much attention to it, it shows that they only used solid facts to explain how this landform was created naturally and not by aliens.

It was not until Apri 5, 1998, a year after Cydonia became their priority, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, as stated in the article. It also says Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture which was ten time sharper than the original Viking photos. This comes to show that NASA did not just go off one photo taken eighteen years before hand. Eager web surfers were anxious to find out something juicy, such as alien life form on Mars, but to their surprise the Face had occured naturally.

The web surfers and many other people were not satisfied with the outcome and were not going to give up on their hopes, but neither was NASA. The critics said how the ""Face on Mars"" is located 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was cloudy on Mars when the photo was taken. NASA then prepared to look again. Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001 Mars Global Surveyor drew in closer for a second time. Garvin stated, ""We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of veiw."" The pixels in the most recent pictures taken spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixels in the best 1976 Viking photo. Garvin also adds how you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size. This means that it is the clearest image you could take and if there just so happened to be things such as airplanes on the ground, Egyptian-style pyramids, or even small shacks the picture could have clearly captured them.

Although many wanted to believe the Face was anything but a natural landform, NASA used strong facts and evidence to fight the arguement and convince people otherwise. I strongly believe The Face on Mars is natural and was not created otherwise because they used all facts and has three different pictures one of which could have spotted things other than the landform, but did not. Nothing but the truth was caught on camera and that is that the ""Face on Mars"" is nothing but a natural landform, and nothing more.               ",0,0.007815996,0,True
251DC3DC07F9,"Have you ever worked on a designed project by a student? Do you think it'll be better than a project designed by a teacher? Teachers are used to making the projects rather than the students. Students say that some teachers, but not all, create poor designed projects. They're wondering if they should create a project themselves rather than from a teacher. While some people say teacher design projects are better to use, it's more important that students design them instead because it helps students become independent workers, increasing their creativity, and gain a life experience.

This will give students a chance of what their made of. If students design their own projects, they'll increase their creativity.

It gives students a chance to think outside of the box. I would get more creative due to the fact that there's no boundaries, so I can do anything that I put my mind too.

Becoming more independent. Your student would feel more like this due to them being the only ones making there own project. They'll have to think for themselves, plan by there self, and create something all on their own. It's a great way to gain and be independent. I remeber when my teacher let me do a project on my own it was hard at first, but if I wanted to complete it I had to get it done myself.

Students gain a life experience. It's a good practice for students to see how it would be like in college. This will be like a foundation to them when they really have to do this all on their own. I also think from my experience is that not everything is easy it's time consuming, but it's all worth it in the end. It shows that if you put your heart and effort into something it shows no matter what.

While some people think letting a teacher designed the projects is better because it's less work for students, less stress on students, and less time consuming, however, it's better for the students to design them because it'll increase their creativity, they'll gain a life experience, and become more independent. In other words letting students design the projects is a better idea than letting teachers design them. ",0,0.0075911554,0,True
1287FB93CF6F,"Dear Principle

I think that it would be a really good idea to make students do community service because, they can learn a lot of things in life, it will also help them with meeting people in life. You should require students to complete students to complete about a total of 30 minutes of community service per day. They should have to do this for a grade kind of like reading logs that are due weekly. Here are the reasons why i think they should have to do this.

The first reason would have to be about learning life experiences they could learn about how bad some people treat earth and how much litter is all over it. They could maybe start a anti-litter group. They could get kids that are in the group from all over the world and, they could even get those kids to help clean up earth.

Another reason is that they could help tutor younger kids or help out in elementary school and help out the teachers. This would also help them in life they might get a since of pride knowing that they might have just changed a little kids life. They might even want to become a teacher when they get older.

My last and final reason is that they might also be able to volunteer at a vet. They could help save a animals life. I know a lot of people that love to be with animals and take care of them. They might grow up to love animals and maybe become a veterinarian.

Those are my 3 reasons on why i think you should require high school students to have to do community service. You could also make it a rule for them to have to take about 50 hours of community service total in a year for students to graduate 12th grade. Thanks for taking the time to read my reasons.

5938A1C7C8EE,"Did you ever think in your wildest dreams that you can be in a car with no driver? Well that may become a reality very soon. I believe that the idea for a self driving car can cause a lot of problems from who is responsible in a crash to how can the manufactures make the cars as safe as possible. There are three main ideas that may have you thinking next time you get behind the wheel. Those are how the cars need someone inside when driving, how they might not need someone inside in the future and how they can signal a passanger to assest f something were to go wrong.

The self-cars most likely need a driver today because of road blocks, construction, or any road problems that might cause the car to crash and not be able to manuver out of the way of the obsticals. The cars also need a driver because if the manufacures were to put the self driving car on the market then not a lot of people will buy it from it costing too much or they just think it's ridiculous. Also if a driver were to crash into a self-driving car and there was no-one in the driver seat then there would be some problems like how the driver would say that it was the cars fault just to get some extra money from the car company.

There also might be a way to alert the driver on stand-by to assest the car. If the car has a DVD player or televison screen and if there is an accentident about to happen, then the car can either shut down the devise or flash on the screen about the danger. The driver might be able to gain control over the situation. Also, if the driver does not have a screen and is using a cell phone as entrainment, then there could be lights instaled under the rear-view mirror and can flash when sensors detect danger.

Now lets say that it is a decade or two from the inital launch of the driving car and about everyone has one. then maybe there wil be no reason for a driver to be present when driving. There are some cars out there with sensors around it to tell the driver to move out of the way of an incoming car. Well I believe that it is possible to have it to where the sensors tell the computer on board the vechicule to move out of the way, eleminating the middle man. Also if there is road constuction then there might be a way to tell all of the cars about it so that they know about where to go and how to get around it.

I believe that it is possible to have a self driving car but it will take a long time. There will be trail and error along side it. But I believe that it is possible, from all of the technical advancements that have been accomplished over the years, i dont see a problem with a self driving car.   ",0,0.007740144,0,True

""How am I supposed to study for my test, If I have to do these activities"", Said Generic_Name. This is causing too much stress and anxiety among students, I said. ""Look at all of classmates, they all look so tired from all these activities"". I agree Its just too much for these students to handle all at once. This is also causing less effort on tests and other stuff. Which can also lead too worse grades and a bad mood among the students. ""My parents are gonna be mad at me now because of my grades""! I agreed my grades aren't looking the best too. We should tell the principal about this. Students shouldn't participate in any extracurricular activities because it causes too much stress and anxiety, worse grades, and from all the stress causes a bad mood.

First, extra activities are causing too much stress and anxiety for students. Stress is becoming a huge problem in schools. For example my friend Generic_Name had stress from all these activities and now he won't even talk to anyone. Anxiety is also becoming a huge problem in schools. Another example is my brother had so activities to do after school it gave him anxiety and stress that his grades became terrible. Stress can eventually lead to depression which isn't good for anyone. For example my friend will had depression form school and the stress now he has to go to therapy. Overall extra activities cause these issues and aren't good for everyone.

Next, From activities students grades are getting worse. Grades are a huge priority for students. For instance my cousin had so many activities to do his parents got mad because of his low grades in school. Low grades will impact your future. Another example my sister had low grades because she had to time to fix them had to stay after school. Low grades will make you have a bad appearance. Last example is my classmate Generic_Name had very low grades form his extra activities that no one wanted to be friends with him. In the end extra activities result in low grades for students.

Last, the stress form activities will make you more frustrated and have a bad mood. Being frustrated would lower your effort and your grades. My classmate Generic_Name was so stressed and frustrated she didn't want to do anything in school. Having a bad mood would make you lose friends and get into fights easily. Next example my brother Generic_Name was so mad and stressed he didn't want to talk to anyone and he ended up losing a lot of friends. Too much frustration might lead to depression. Last example my cousin Generic_Name was frustrated from these activities he almost had depression. At the end being stressed and being frustrated is not good for the student.

""Im so happy"", said Generic_Name. I can't believe the principal said yes I said. ""Now we don't have to be worried about our grades"", said Generic_Name. ""No more being stressed about your grades""! I agreed now we have much more time to study and learn. Extra activities cause too much stress and anxiety among students. We don't have to be worried about these activities anymore.   ",0,0.0069932877,0,True
B286E6029ECB,"I remember when asking in math class on how to do something and if there are other ways to do it and feeling the movement of my pencil and hearing on what it had to say when being written down. What is happening there is that I knew one way to do it but I wanted to know if there was other ways to do it. And if so which way I pick would be the easier way for me to get my answer for that type of problem. When seeking multiple opinion it can help someone make a better choice because it can help them lead in to a better option and help them show different ways on how to do something.

First reason on when seeking multiple opinion to make a person choice better is because it can help them lead into a better choice. When answering question on paper people may ask the teacher to ask to help them or a friend to help them with it. For example, when I don't know something I ask a friend or my teacher to help me lead to a better choice for that problem. So when people have math class they might ask a question if they can help the or a friend to dot he same. For example, when I in math class and some of friends who don't get it, I tell them the way to do it and lead them in the way to the right answer.

Second reason when seeking multiple opinion to help someone make a better choice is because it can help them show different ways to do it. When doing math there can be different ways on how to do something like your times table. For example, When I do my times table I just know it but for other I would use a calculator for it or just do it myself. Another way in math is when you divide because just like you when you times something there are different ways on how to do something. For example, in math I just know it but if I don't then I use a calculator to help me with that question.

In conclusion, when seeking multiple opinion it can help someone by making a better choice because it can show them different ways on how to do it and lead them to a better option. Just like when I was in math feeling that the way I knew was to hard I found a different one and made my life easier. An when seeking multiple option it can help you thing differently, and if knowing if there are other ways to do something. Just like when you are in math learning the other ways to do something or by show a friend the easier for you that you use. By that that just show that mulitlple option can help you or someone else to make the better choice.",0,0.007719713,0,True
69551E79C36E,"The Face on Mars

""The Face on Mars"" is a ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head,"" as NASA stated in 1976.

Many know that it is just a natural landform like on earth, but some believe that the Face was created by aliens.

The Face is nothing more than a natural landform because we have landforms like it here on earth, photographic evidence reveals a natural landform, and there is no evidence that the Face was built by life outside of earth.

The Face on Mars is nothing more than a natural landform, just like we have on earth.

Jim Garvin, who is the chief scientist of NASA's Mars Exploration Program, knows that the Face is just another landform.

""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" he said, ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

This is just one piece of evidence that the Face cannot be anything more than a natural landform--because it has many characteristics of a landform here on earth.

A second reason that the Face on Mars is nothing more than a natural landform is because of the images taken in 2001 by Mars Global Surveyor (MGS).

Twenty five years after its first photographs, clearer, higher resolution photos of Face came from MGS.

From the 43 meters per pixel in the 1976 photograph versus the 1.56 meters per pixel in the 2001 photograph, there is clearly enough evidence that the Face on Mars is just a natural land formation similar to a mesa.

The rises and dips in the landform just resemble the shape of eyes, nose, and mouth of a human face and nothing more, but after seen more clearly, cracks and crevaces in the land prove that the Face is just a natural landform.

Those who believe that the Face on Mars was built by aliens have nothing to base their beliefs on other than the fact that the landform resembles a face.

No evidence whatsoever suggests that the Face was built by supernatural life.

On the other hand, photos--and common sense itself--prove that the landform is just another landform like we have on earth.

The passage itself proves the authenticity of the landform.

It says that ""thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform.

There was no alien monument at all,"" proving that the Face is only a landform.

To conclude, no evidence suggests that the Face on Mars is anything more than a natural landform.

The Face has characteristics of a landform on earth, and images of it from 2001 reveal only a landform.

On top of that, those who believe that alien activity is responsible for the creation of the Face have little to no information to base their beliefs on.

In the end, though, we know that the little landform called the Face of Mars is just one of our universe's great mysteries.",0,0.0069638384,0,True
830E5FA9FC72,"The Negative Effects Of The Technology On People's Lives.

Technology helps people to preform many things hence, classes online, shop and communicate with others. I believed that technology has negative effects on people's lives because people have a limitation of a human contact due to the use of technology. Also technology had changed our style of lives; People used to visit parks to talk with other. Families do not spend time together. Students are distracted with their cell phone at schools. Children do not read books or have fun like in the past. Now everything had changed due to this issue.

One reason that technology has negative effects on people's lives is that now some stores closed because people do not shop in this stores anymore. Some people prefer to buy their materials or clothes online stores as Amazon. Amazon has a strong impact of sales in the world, Their sales are more high than any other stores. For example I recently heard about two store named STORE_NAME and STORE_NAME. They have this issue due to the use of technology. STORE_NAME is about to close because people prefer to stay at home and buy online. This stores are on sale of everything to close right away because

Fewer people visit this stores. Their sales had exceed on online store than in the located stores. Additionally people who work in this stores are going to have a layoff due to this matter.

Another reason that technology has negative effects on people's lives is that some places are empty namely: Parks, lakes, and malls. People decide to stay at home playing video games, and buying online.

Some people think that technology is a better way to express themselves. However, there are to many ways such as painting, drawing, playing even dancing.

Example I am a member of a dance class, my teacher was talking about this problem with technology. She was saying that sometimes our lives depend on a cell device, but not all the time. My point of view is that what she told me was true because I came to United Stated of America since 2016; I was not be able to understand or speak to others. When I did not understand some difficult words I used Google translated, so technology helped us sometime. However, I had seen some students who used their cellphone during classes. When the teacher ask them questions related to the topic, they do not know what to answer due to the technology.

In the other hand Some people will argue about technology has positive effects on our style of lives. Technology helps us to communicate with our families and friends. However technology limited us to express our ideas with no need of a cell phone device . Also it had destroyed our culture. It limited the growth of children because, they do not want to go outside to play with their friends. Children want to stay at home playing with their laptops. In fact this generation do not read books or magazine because of the technology. Example, My cousin is in the middle school he played Fourtnite everyday. He goes to sleep late, had bad grades and he wake up late for school. He does not read any book and neither go outside to play. He always is with his cell phone playing. I believe that the life is so short to waste.

In the final analyses technology will keep going to destroy our cultures. People will not go outside at all, to buy, to have fun, or to spend time with their families. My point of view is technology have a really negative effect on us because it had changed us, our world. everything in this world is going to be different. Technology limited the develop of ideas.Technology limited our communication, our knowledge, our curiosity, and our happiness.",0,0.006547312,0,True

It was established as a  compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote elected by the citizens. But people such as Bradford plumer are staring to think even the ""best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"". While others believe we should keep our ""despised method of choosing the President"" said - Richard A. Posner. but in all reality the Congress should keep the Electoral College as a way of electing the presidents and its candidates, even though it could use some updating.

The Electoral College should be kept as the way of voting for the President and his/hers candidates. ""Despite the lack of democratic predigree, its all pratical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons."" says Posner. A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible, but its not likely than a dispute over the popular vote. Basically its a certainty of an outcome, Now understanding the fact that the electoral college voters vote not for the president, but for the state of electors, and over 60 perecent of the voters would prefer a direct election. Only because the people believe the electoral college is unfair, outdated and irrational to the voters. People can see what the ones against the electoral college are upset about, its true, it is the electors who elect the president, not the citizens who vote. But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominees, and that trust hardley ever betrayed.

Ones against have said ""the large states get more attention from presidental candidates in a campaign rather than a small state"". They also have said ""the winner of the take it all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all, including South Carolina and Rhode Island.. they didnt even get a single ad"". But the electoral college restores some of the weight in the political balance that the large states lose in population.

Plumer strongly believes to abolish the electoral college. This year he already expects a close election in which the popular vote winner could lose the the presidency yet again, but the electoral college still has its defenders.. In his arguement he would call the electoral college a ""disaster factor"". The only disater factor on the electoral college is that its not a modern sense.. When you vote for a presidental candidate your actually voting for a slate of electors. The Electoral College needs to be updated in the method of selecting a president.

In a nutshell, the Electoral College should be the way to vote for the president and the candidates. It could be argued that the elctoral college is unfair and not updated, which is true, the electoral college needs to be updated. But the electoral college was made by founding fathers as a compromise, and it should stay that way.            ",0,0.007145417,0,True
06F5F6A09DC6,"More than one person's advice

Have you ever wondered or questioned yourself why do you have to ask more than one person's for advice? Yep you heard me. People from all around the world ask advice about anything. That could be video games, schools, and even Life. Obviously, there are many other things to ask advice. It's kind of asking for help, you can say. People incuding kids, teens, and even adults are asking advice that could help them in the furture, you guys even might have connections, and more than one person. More than one is better than just asking for one person's advice.

Having connections

The people you ask for advice were kids too just like you and they possibly ran into what you are stuck or struggling at right now. I recommand you to ask adults more than anyone else. That's either with struggles at school, home, family members, or even life. I almost forgot to include decisions because small decisions can eventually become big decisions. I recommand you to ask adults more than anyone else. I mean you can ask seniors but they most likely will forget everything since they were kids. The worst thing you can do is asking someone young even a 18 year old adult because you never know what happened in them. Trust and worthy friends you can ask but friends that you just say hi to once a day or even a week wouldn't be so great.

Help in the future

Advices not just help from the presents but in the future as well. According to my calculations you could use that advice over and over again. For example, let's say you didn't know where you put a comma in a sentence, therefore, you used a person's advice and it was to put a and where ever you were going to put the comma at. You can also use it to help your kids and even grandsons if you still remember.

More than one person's advice

Last but not least, why more than one person's advice you ask. One advice can help and even solve whatever you have in mind but you actually want to check if they were right. You probably want to gather the information and rethink it. Everyone in my opinion should at most ask two people for advice just to make sure. First person person wasn't being that specific enough so you decide to go to another person. If they haven't been specific enough then just go to another person. I mean how hard is that? Especially kids since they have just started growing up and will soon become young adults.

Everybody should be struggling something in a certain time of life that they ask for advice. Don't be shy for asking advice and you believe in yourself that you are a brave and confedent man that doesn't need help. Because really you will be a better one for asking advice. Therefore, the reason that we ask advice is to become someone better each day by taking that advice.",0,0.007855974,0,True

Drivers should not be able to drive with phones because of the outcomes that could happen. A lot of drivers like to text and talk on the phone, but mostly text when they are at a red light or even text while they are in motion driving. Driving with phones in hands can cause accidents like crashing into another car, running off the road causing damage to the driver and any other passengers in the car if any and injuring other drivers on the road and even causing death upon yourself. Some people are addicted to their phones and want to be on their phone every time they get a chance.

Texting while driving and other cell phone use while driving facts and statistics show that this multitasking behind the wheel is becoming a life threatening norm. Talking or texting while driving or checking or sending social media post take eyes and brains off the task of driving. "" Usage of hands free device while driving"", ""Hands free is not risk free"". The use of technology is improving more and more each day. We went from rotary phones, to beepers, to touchscreens.

We've gotten so improved that we can use hands-free devices to still carry out our conversations. It's not a bad thing, no its how and when we use such device. If using such device affects us and there around us in a negative wa, than we must make a change. The life you save could be your very own. Despite the enormous benefit derived from the use of hands-free devices, there is also some detrimental aspect of such use.

For example, walking and chewing gum involve a thinking and a nonthiking task. Help make the world a safer place; eyes on the road, hands on the wheel, mind on driving.

I believe it is a good idea to talk to more than one person because it can help you make a better choice in then end. Different peoples opinions can help build one strong one, different point of views are always good to hear and older more wiser people have been though lot's of stuff and it could be good to ask them too.

Asking for advice from many different people is the way to go. One person's advice could be pushing your in a bad direction thats why it's good to get multiple peoples thoughts. Different point of view are good on this topic because many some peoples advice can persuade you to make a bad opinion and if you get multiple peoples advice it can even it out and you can make a good opinion. Everyone has different views and it's good to see the whole picture.

Older's peoples advice is always a good choice to ask for because they have been though a lot and they have some good advice on what to say. Elders are much wiser than asking kids because they have already dealt with these sorts of things and you can trust them more than most people. Asking more than one Elder is what I would do because they are mostly right and have lot's of different views. Thats why asking many different Elders is good.

Different peoples opinions on advice can help build one big strong one. If you get the same advice from two different people and then you ask a 3rd person and they say the opposite of what the other people said, you would most likely pick the Advice that two people had said. Building a strong statement is key and if you get advice from many people that have done something like it, it will help make a good opinion. A strong opinion is the best opinion when it come to making choices and getting advice.

If you take advice from lot's of different people your outcome will be better than only asking one person. Using different points of views, using your elder's and even asking someone that you trust are all good ways to find some good advice. seeking more than one persons advice will help you make a much better choice.

694238280A93,"I think the Electoral college is a good way to vote for the president or vice president because i think without the Electoral college, we wouldn't have anyone to vote for the president or vice president. We have each candidate running for president in our state and it has his or her own group of electors. The electors are chosen by the candidate political party.

I agree that most state have a winner take all system because it awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. The 23rd Amendment of the constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College.

The word state refers to the District of Columbia. The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. We help choose our state's electors when we vote for president because when we vote for our candidate we are actually voting for our candidate electors.

I think the best laid defenses of the system are wrong because some voters might sometime vote for the wrong candidate and they might sometime get confused about the electors. After Al Gore thanks to the quirks of the electoral college, he won the popular vote but lost the presidency. Over 60 percent of voters would perfer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. The disaster factor is the single best argument against the electoral college. I agree that most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters because of the winner take all system in each state. Candidate don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning,focusing only on the tight races in the swing states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidate at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina,and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't see a single campaign ad. I agree that the it's official that the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best agruments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. The agruments against direct elections are spurious at best. It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right. Abolish the electoral college.

I think the five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President was for its lack of democratic. The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. I disagree the advocates of this postition are correct in arguing that the Electoral college method is ot democratic in a modern sense. It is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When we vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors because we're not actually voting for the president, we're just voting for the slate of electors. Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed. However it it entirely possibe that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections inn which no candidate receives a majority of the vote cast. I agree that they made the five reasons for retaining the Electoral College.

The electoral college seems to have worked for all these years , but my opinion on this is that we should change it to electing a president with popular vote. There are many pros and cons to both the electoral college and the popular vote but the positives of the popular vote outweigh the negatives more then the electoral does. If you are reading this senator of state I hope this letter will support your opinion on this or make you consider popular vote.

The united states is a democracy so the citizens living here should have the right to vote for the president of the united states. With the electoral college the citizens are'nt the ones voting for the president the electors are. In the electoral college the voters are voting for a slate of electors, who then vote for the president. In most cases the elector votes for the candidate that their party wants, in some cases the elector has chosen the opposing candidate to what his party wants according to the second source. Since the elector is allowed to do this that is one reason why the electoral college is unfair. Popular vote is when the people vote for the candidate they want this is truly what a democracy is when the people choose their representatives.

The electoral college is unfair to voters because of the winnertakeall system in all the states, because candidates don't spent time in the states they know they will lose in. They only focus on the states that they know they will win in or of a close chance to the other candidate, because of this there has been times when people would not see the candidates at all or they did'nt get to see a single campaign ad. If there was popular vote then this would not be the case and it would be eliminated, because candidates would have no choice but to put up advertisements all over the country.

Even though the popular vote is a good way to go I think that this system of electing president is still not perfect or will never be perfect. The electoral college allowed some of are greatest presidents to win beacuse if they got more electoral votes then popular vote it would'nt matter they will still win. The electoral college also avoids the problem of one candidate not recieving the majority of the votes cast. The electoral college has been in are country for so long and has worked for us well but I still believe that the popular vote can be and should be used in future elections.

Helping each other is one of the easiest way to get done with something but working alone you may take longer because you have to search up things and some times they do not know where to start.

Teachers put students in a group to see how they act around each other like if they act goofy or if they do not have self control. When working with a group there has to be self control because if the group is just being goofy then they would not get work done and they can get a bad grade and not work together in that class ever again.

30293E16144E,"Dear, state senator

I believe we should keep the Electoral College for the president of the United States.

Because it's easier to read when voting, everything is label right, and the President has alot of trust in people.

First of all, I believe we should keep the Electoral College for the president of the

United States because it's easier to read when voting. In source one, by the Office of the Federal Register, it states that ""The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President"". This shows that when all the votes are tallyed up theirs no need to go through so much problem, when their's basically a rubric to go over the electors and the electoral votes. For example, if this wasn't invented, we would have our own people just sit their on long day and nights. Without any sleep and count all those votes. This could lead to alot of miscounts. This is why I believe we should keep the Electoral College for the presidnet of the United States.

Furthermore, I believe we should keep the Electoral College for the president of the

United States because everything is label right. In source one, by the Office of the Federal Register, it states that ""Under the 23rd Amendement of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors. . . ."". This shows that whatever the 23rd Amendment is under, that's what the District of Columbia is allocated. This is just like an case at court or when you getting arrested. For example, when you are pleged guilty for murder. The judge is going to read every amendment you broke and what's your charges. And everything that's she's reading is made up. It's all labeled in United State Constitution. This is why i strongly believe we should keep the Electroal College for the president of the United States.

Lastly, I believe we should keep the Electoral College for the president of the

United States because the president has alot of people to trust in. In source one, by the Office of the Federal Register it states that ""Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors."" This shows that whoever the president of the United State is choosing for his or her own group of electors has put alot of trust on each and one of that individual. And it's time for the President to see who or who he can't put his trust in. For example, A president has alot of things that we depend on him or her to do for our Country. And the Electoral College is the best way to see if he or she could do it. This is why I believe we should keep the Electoral College for the president of the United States.

In conclusion, I strongly believe we should keep the Electoral College for the president of the United States because; One, it's easier to read when voting. If the Electoral College didn't existed their would be alot of miscounting. Second, everything is label right. Their's no need to get things from the top of your head. Third, the presdient has aot of in trust in people. Us humans gets to finally see if we could depend on him. If he choose's the right group of electors.

I have been thinking quite a bit about your idea of making it required to do community service. In my opinion this is a great idea, but an even greater idea not to. Instead of making kids do community service, you could just reward the kids who do. If there is a reward most kids would like, then more kids would want to do community service to get the reward and would feel good about doing something right.

They also would really enjoy the fact that they made the decision themselves and were not forced to do so.

For example the kids really like your cut in line passes. You could say for 2 hours of community service you can have enough cut in line passes to get you through the week. This would really tempt them because they hate waiting in line for lunch because they are cranky and hungry.

Another example is rewarding them with free time. Every Friday for the kids who gave at least 2 hours of community service can have the choice of skipping his or her last two periods and getting full credit on any of the assignments they will be missing. To just go to the gym and hang out, and not have to worry about their classes. This would also really draw kids attention because they already hate school and even though they might not act like it really wish they could get ""A' s"".

Therefore, rewarding kids for community service hours would be a great idea. It would also greatly increase students wanting to do community service so they to can be rewarded with fuller stomachs and less of a headache.

Many schools require the students to complete summer assignments to keep their knowledge from the past school year and to begin learning for the next school year. These assignments should be created by the teacher instead of the students, for it will benefit the students more when the teacher creates them.

These summer assignments should be teacher designed, for if students made them, they would make them as easy as they would be allowed to. While students are enrolled in school to learn and gain knowledge, they are also being pushed to receive high grades; therefore, they will try to make their own work as easy as possible to ensure a relatively high grade on the assignment. For example, when students do peer reviews in class, students will usually give each other high grades to make sure that the other students are giving them a high grade as well. It doesn't matter how the others truly did, they just want to have a high grade ensured for themselves, so they will give a high grade to anyone. If a student has a way to without a doubt receive 100% ,they will make sure of it. If the summer assignment was from Geometry going into Algebra 2, they would pick the most basic algebra questions that they could come up with and use what they thought was the easiest unit in geometry to make up the review portion. The students would create a summer assignment that is too easy for someone at their own learning level, making the summer assignment remotely pointless to the students.

Half the information on a summer assignment is review from the year before while half is the new information for the coming school year; therefore, students are unable to create their own summer assignments because they wouldn't even know half the information they are writing about. Writing the review portion of the assignment may be able to help the students go over the material once more; however, they gain nothing out of writing the learning portion. If a student is trying to learn something will trying to create an assignment for others to learn it, they will just end up confusing themselves and not grab any knowledge from the said subject. Students are doing the learning portion of the assignment to learn new material, hence why the teacher create these assignments in a way to make it easy to teach it to the students even when they are on break. Teachers will use the information in the review portion in the learning portion to make the process easier for the students, making it even more beneficial for the students.

Summer assignments are a vital part of a students learning experience. These summer projects help students have an easy transition from one school year, through summer, into the next school year. These assignments make it possible to immediately begin learning at the begin of the school year, for the students already have the background information that they need.

CD8F95C18776,"To whomever it may concern,

The process of the Electoral College has been a problem for many years and deserves to be abolished at its roots. The Electoral College should not be kept due to the fact that not many Americans comprehend this legal process, swing vote catastrophies and other problems, and its lack of democratic pedigree. You may wonder why someone like me is even writing about this or why I even care, but I care about what happens in my country's economy and government, and others should too.

First thing's first: knowledge. From personal experiences and research, you may realize that the majority of Americans in 2014 couldn't describe to you what the process of the Electoral College even is. Each state is different in this process, just like each opinion is different about this topic. This is an immensely confusing subject to read about, especially when you're just an average person watching the news or reading an article online. Although, let's be real for a minute: its really difficult. The process consists of selecting the electors, and the meeting of the electors where they vote for our President and Vice President. Also, in school curriculum across the country, you never really go into depth about the Electoral College unless you're taking a hardcore government class. In this case, the students are yet to be informed about the causes and effects of the Electoral College and the disasters it can cause in our economy.

Let's continue, shall we? The swing vote catastrophies, the worrying about who will be elected and whether or not they'll do a good job controlling our government, it's just not worth it. Over sixty percent of voters would prefer a direct election rather than the system that we use now. When citizens vote, they're basically voting for slates of electors, who then eventually vote to elect the President as well as the Vice President. The question is: Who are the electors? Who picks them? Are they responsible with the task at hand? The fact of the matter is that you really have no control over who the electors vote for. A ""faithless"" elector can vote for whomever they please, even if it isn't their party's candidate. This process is extremely unfair to voters across the country, and I doubt the phrase ""Life isn't fair"", a quote by my grandmother, would even apply to this discussion.

As previously stated, the process of the Electoral College isn't the greatest of them all, nor is it fair to voters. I asked who the electors were, and who picks them... but where is the abundant democratic pedigree? To remind you, a democratic pedigree is the origin and history of something, especially when it is good or impressive to others. The Electoral College is outdated and irrational for our modern day concepts. This extensive process lacks alot of opinions, evidence, and background knowledge that is necessary when voting for candidates. On the other hand, there is usually a certainty of outcome in the election, and it avoids run-off elections which is pleasant to citizens who are for the Electoral College. What about the swing votes? What about the values?

To wrap things up, the Electoral College is not needed in the United States government because of lack of understanding, disasters that may be caused, and the democratic pedigree and honesty that is nowhere to be found. I hope you consider my decisions and grow very fond of my reasonings.

Participating in an extracurricular activity can help you later in life. It can help you because people would be there for you.

Another effect of participating in an extracurricular activity is it will get you more involved with different activities. Just like the second paragraph this is one is great too. When you get more involved its good for you because you meet different people and famous people. Thats how it can help you later in life.

If the person feels like its taking away to much time for stuff that they want to do they don't have to. if others want to help they can tutor elementary kids or clean up the litter they can even create other ways them self. when i see people doing community service that want to do it makes me feel good but if i see kids that don't want to do community service them it makes me feel bad that their doing it.

student that feel like they have the time and that their in the right place can do what ever they feel like doing . do you ever think about how the kids feel about homework or community service. some are different then others. some will do it, some wont do it. for people that want to help the community they can help around by a park, help old people, help old people cross the street and do all that for no money but just for the thought of helping people.

i believe you should make it an option ether yes or no.

B5015A51C0A5,"Dear Senator,

The reason for writing this letter is because in a recent topic brought up to the nation the Electoral College was being revised to see new changes in the way we choose our president. The Electoral college is a fundamental way on how we control the voting process for our president. In an article ""What is the Electoral College"" by the Office of the Federal Register it had an interesting statement that stood out. In the text it said "" The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election by a vote in Congress and election of the President by popular vote..."". This is telling us that the Electoral College that was established many years ago is the same thing that people are voting for now, because people today are fighting for voting by popular vote but the current Electoral College is the same thing. The current Electoral College is working fine, this is one of the reasons it shouldn't change but there are more reasons as to why it shouldn't change.

The current Electoral College has worked greatly to our nation even though people don't see it that way but it has. Another reason that the Electoral College should stay the same is because many people want to abolish the Electoral College even though its helped them choose a president that is either fighting for the nation itself or fighting for the people. The reason that people want o abolish the Electoral college is in an article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer. In the article it states "" It's official: The electoral college is unfair... Abolsih the electoral college!"". This is telling us that some of the people in the nation want to abolish the Electoral College because they want their own system of electing a president.

The Electoral College has been named man things and has been tried to change but it can't because that is the only way people as a nation know how to choose a president. In the article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer it says "" ...The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. and the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best.."". This shows us that even the people that are fighting agaist the Electoral College are making random statements that either go for it or against it because they don't know what they are fighting to achieve.

The Electoral College is the same thing people are trying to change because in the article ""What is the Electoral College"" by the Office of the Federal Register it states "" The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect a president..."". This textual evidence shows that the Constitution was actually compromising what the people are fighting for and what is already used. This also tells us that the current Electoral College is what is needed and shouldn't be changed.

In Conclusion, the Electoral College shouldn't be abolished or changed to popular vote elects the president because the current system is working fine and the reason people are fighting agaisnt it is because they might not know what they are fighting to change or maybe they think that the Electoral College is changing the vote so that they government has their chosen president rather than the peoples president. All those ideas are things that people think when their favored senator, mayor, or President loses their chance. The people just need to realize that the current Electoral college was made by the fathers of this country in order to compromise what they are fighting for and what is already used. These are the reason why the Electoral College should not be changed.            ",0,0.0075620385,0,True

In Vauban, Germany, people have given up their cars. There is a fee to park in Vauban which is a coast of $40,000.  No one is going to want to drive do to that outrageous price.  70 percent of the people living in Vauban doesnt own a car and, 57 percent sold their car once they moved there.  ""'When I had a car i was always tense.  I'm much happier this way' said Heidrun Walter"".  This quote shows that cars just bring you done emotionly and you'll feel better with out one.  In Vauban, cars are causing 12 percent of greenhouse gases.  The percent of greenhouse gases are four times higher in the U.S do to car's gas emissions.

In Paris, there is a smog problem going on.  There is so much pollution in the air that there was a forced ban on driving.  If anyone was found driving they were fined $31.  4,000 people were fined and 27 had their cars taken do to not wanting to pay the fine or being difficult.  Paris had the most smog out of the European country; in Paris there was 147 micrograms of particulate matter, Brussels had 114 and, London had 79.7.

Bogota, Colombia has an annual car-free day.  A day full of hiking, biking, skating and bus riding.  If found driving on the car-free day you are fined with $25.  ""'It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,' said businessman Carlos Plaza"".  President Obama is getting envolved with the limiting car usuage aslo. His goal is to curb the greenhouse gas emissions.  There have been less cars bought and licenses given out as the years go by.  Lastly, there has been a 23 percent decrease in young peolple driving from the years 2001 to 2009.

These are some reasons why car usuage should be limited; and as you can see many countries are starting to make a difference.    ",0,0.0067281746,0,True

If student do a summer project about just studient animals look for there behavior, some student mite think is fun.

Teacher can grade something interesting not some boring work they tell us to do. i think even the teacher can have fun reading all the thing we come up with in the summer is just going to be fun for student and teachers.

I think teacher would be even happier if student do something they are going to get the benefits of it maybe a student wants to learn about how to treat a open cut or how to save the world from pollution. That would be something interesting that a student can learn about and who knows it mite come in handy and same the world from pollution and treat open cuts because your mom or friends got a dip cut in the house or in school.

I am addressing the new policy that you are considering changing. The new policy of, any students who have below a B average, then they cannot participate in any sports or other activities. I think this new policy is unfair to most of the athletic students and coaches. Usually, a sports team has students with a C averages. They barely can play. If this policy is applied, then there will not be many players on a team. The players are stressed enough to play a sport and keep a C average. It would be too much of a struggle to keep up with all your work and play a sport. At least at a B average, it would be. The idea would have some of the players/students working on a class to keep up that grade but may forget about the other subjects, and go down in that grade.",0,0.0074740024,0,True

A lot of students hide all of their emotions and hold them inside and that sometimes can make us do crazy irrational things, like shooting up a school full of kids. If we had this technology we could figure out how a student feels and try our best and do whatever we can to help them before it gets to that point. If we had that technology we would be able to get a student into counciling or to a therapist or just to a close friend to talk to because who knows that could save that students life. If we knew what was bothering students or knew that there was something bothering a student we could maybe avoid all of those student v. s. teacher fights that happen because that student isnt in the right mindset and that teacher had no idea.

Another reason why that type of technology would be useful is learning. Say a student was doing some school work on a computer and they start falling asleep because the content is so boring. If we had that type of technology the computer could change the way the content is being presented into a wat that is more interesting and exciting to the student. Every student learns differently and if we had that technology then we all could excel in school.

Not only could we learn better and help the teachers understnad us better we could understand the people around us better. We could learn how to recognize those faces and understand how the person we are talking to is really feeling. Not only that we could make a whole new lie detector test for authorities. If they had those they could truely find out if someone is guilty because as the passage said faces dont lie. Maybe if we had that type of technology helping the law the crime rate would go down emencely because if criminals knew that no matter what they did they would always fail this test if they lied they wouldnt commit those crimes and risk getting caught.

In conclusion, having this technology could help the world beyond our imagination. If we had this, maybe, just maybe our dreams for a better place might start to become true.",0,0.007994924,0,True

There are many benefits to participating in these activities. It is a good idea for students to be required to participate in at least one team or club. All students should participate in extracurricular activities because they encourage healthy lifestyles and stronger communities.

Activities like sports promote a healthy lifestyle. They include lots of physical activity which is something many people aren't getting enough of. Exercise is very important for children and teens. It has been proven that participating in some sort of club or team also decreases the risk of joining a gang. These activities also promote mental health. They send many positive messages to students. Clubs and teams build strong communities and friendships, which can help improve mental health.

Extracurricular activities make a stronger sense of community between students.

Activities like sports and student council are great ways to make friends and find new interests. They can help students meet people with similar interests. Many kids find it easier to make friends with people they can relate to. That is why extracurricular activities are such a great opportunity to build friendships.

Not only are extracurricular activities healthy, they are also fun! I love playing sports and getting to do what I love with my friends. By participating in extracurricular activities, you can find new hobbies that you enjoy. You can explore a variety of fun activities when you join. Extracurricular activities are a great way to have some fun with friends while also exploring your interests.

All students should join an extracurricular activity because they help students live healthy lives and be more connected within their community.

365BF456DE1E,"A Face To Remember

A distinctly human face, nearly two miles in length, stretches across an arid, barren landscape. This came to be known as ""the face on Mars. It is a highly debated topic, being that some believe it was made by intelligent lifeforms, and others believe it to be a naturally formed landform. The latter is, beyond the shadow of a doubt, correct, the reasons range from picture evidence, to the same landforms forming on Earth, to the fact that it would help NASA's budget immensely if life were to be discovered on other planets.

To begin with, concrete photos have been released to the public that clearly show that the ""face"" is merely shadows cast onto a natural landform. Since the beginning of its discovery in 1976, ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoah."" Guess what? They were right, because in 2001, Mars Global Surveyor brought back a photo of the mesa that was in the ""...absolute maximum resolution,"" and it perfectly showed the mesa for what it was; a naturally formed chunk of land.

Another thing distinct about this landform is that we have similair, proven-to-be natural landforms on Earth. To quote Garvin, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" This means it is an undeniable truth that these kind of things can form naturally. Of course because something can, usually means that it will, so, without denial, this landform is proven to be real, and able to form.

The final fact of the matter is that NASA would get an enormous amount of funding if they could prove there to be life among the stars. So the truth is, ""...defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" This discovery would lead to a piqued interest in space, and a need to conduct further research, meaning people would begin to give more donations to this new, interesting cause. In the end NASA would benefit, and the point is proven wrong.

Over all, consiracy theorist seemingly wish to stir the masses, and make distrust flourish, but most times their theories are easily dissproven. The theory of the face on Mars was simple, and very wrong. The topic of solid photographs seems not to be enough, but the similair landmarks being on Earth, and the way it would positively effect NASA's budget should be. After all, there may still be life on Mars, for this is but a bump on a planet.",0,0.0067810393,0,True
51C2E40EE994,"""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus with even more challenging clouds that are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere"". Venus is very dangerous for humans to step foot on and could not have spacecrafts to last more than a few hours due to the temperatures and atmospheric pressure. In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author implies that exploring Venus is worth the risk by explaining the dangers and the motivation of human curiosity.

To understand Venus clearly, NASA wants to explore Venus on their own. They can either consider the exploration as a risk, or the exploration can be thought out as a challenge that people are willing to take despite the dangers. ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet"". Humans cannot undergo, let alone survive stepping foot on Venus with these extreme conditions. Earth's ""twin"" planet also has ""the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system"". Although there are many dangers to explore Venus, astronomers are fascinated by the idea that Venus has been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.

Human curiosity has motivated NASA to send other humans to study Venus. One way of doing so is by ""allowing scientists to float above the fray"". Floating above the fray would allow humans to avoid the harsh ground conditions. Miles away from the surface will still be ""170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth"". These conditions will not be easy, but will be survivable for humans. To contribute to the knowledge of Venus, researchers are are working on different task that will allow the machines to last long enough on Venus.

In conclusion, Venus presents a great amount of reasons that can be dangerous for humans to explore. Since Venus is the most Earth-like planet in our solar system, Venus was probably covered with large oceans and could have supported many forms of life. Predictions like these cause people to want to meet the very end of imagination and innovation to finally see the true value of Venus to make the exploration a worthy pursuit.

Cellphones are a major distraction due to the fact that they can be taken and used anywhere. due to this students are easily distracted. Cellphones also can recieve call and texts at any time.

In Vauban, Germany, people do not use cars. They find other means of transportation, such as biking and walking. In Bogota, the construction of bicycle paths has made 118 miles of passages for residents. According to David Goldberg, ""All our development since World War II has been centered around the car."" While that is not entirely true, it does have a good point. We should move on from the all-powerful box with wheels.

One major reason for not using cars is pollution. As most of us know, pollution is bad for the environment, and for most life on Earth. Unfortunately, our use of cars and power plants is generating pollution faster then plants can take it out of the atmosphere. ""Transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions"", Elisabeth Rosenthal said. In the article, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", 60% of drivers in Paris stopped after five days of intensifying smog. That means that the smog was dense enough to where it was dangerous for drivers to go anywhere.

The article ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" mentions that: ""The turnout [for car-free day] was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota."" Why would people continue to participate in car-free day if they hated it so much? Despite the fine of $25, it really isn't a big deal. One of the participants, Carlos Arturo Plaza, said, ""It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.""

Now, how can you simply stop driving? You need to get to your job! Nobody is telling you to move to Vauban. However, biking or walking to the park could help. You don't need a car to go to your neighbor's house. They're right next door. Of course, not using cars is not going to stop the pollution from power plants, but it will certainly slow down how fast it is going into the atmosphere.

We simply can't allow pollution to go where it is going. If we all stop relying on cars to get us to places, we will have enough time to think of an easier solution. Bill Ford laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. There is a chance that being car-free won't be as bad as everyone thinks.

Changing to election by popular vote for the president is a better choice and it is fair.

That example shows that the electoral college is unfair because the people arent actaully voting.

in your state it shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in december of the election year. but then if you think of its actually wrong because its of how many votes can the electors can get not the president. after the presidential election, your state governor prepares a 'certificate of ascerainment'.

If we were able to use our phones when we have free time, there wouldn't be as many kids trying to be sneaky about texting in class.

To begin with, the nurse has a lunch right when we do.

She wont let you into the clinic unless you have a pass from your teacher.

Except, if you fall outside on the patio, or you get sick, there isn't going to be a teacher to write you a pass.

There also isn't going to be a nurse to call your parents for you.

This sounds like a pretty good time to be able to use your cell phone.

Just last year, when I was in 7th grade,

I was running a all day and I was trying to wade it out to see if I could make it through the day.

I tried to go to the clinic, but she wasn't there, and I threw up on the patio.

Had I been able to use my cell phone, I could have had my mom come pick me up.

Also, what if you get hurt out on the patio, such as a fall the cuts your knee wide open.

when there's no nurse, what are you going to do?

I believe this is a reason to think about when considering the cell phone policy.

Teenagers love to communicate.

What better way then with a cell phone?

Now, I know what you're thinking, but I'm not talking about allowing us to have out phones out during classes.

We need to focus on out education.

That's what those core classes are for.

But during lunch, or an elective, if our friends have a free period as well, what would the harm be in texting them?

It's not like we're distracting them from learning math, or science, or another important class.

Just by allowing us to have our phones out for the two or three classes plus lunch we have that aren't core classes, you wouldn't have near as many problems with kids texting in their actual classes.

I believe kids would actually focus more in their class knowing that they don't have to risk getting caught now, when they know there will be a time for them to text later.

When thinking about the cell phone policy for SCHOOL_NAME, I hope you'll take my ideas into consideration.

Though, technology like the Facial Action Coding System is extremely advanced, and could have a major positive affect. Not only could it have a major positive affect on today's society, but it could also have a positive affect on future generations. I believe that the Facail Action Coding System could be very valuable; if it is used for the right reasons. The Facial Action Coding System could help solve many problems in today's society. It could help the law, it could help teachers form better teaching methods, and it can be used for medical purposes.

The law has trouble with telling when someone is lying or even when they are telling the truth. I believe that the Facial Action Coding System could help solve this problem. Acorrding to the paragraph, the Facial Action Coding System can calculate the percent of the certain facial expressions that you are making. Which we all know that when most people lie, they make a certain facial expression or they act a certain way. If police and judges were able to use this sofwear they would be able to tell when someone is liying, and when someone is telling the truth. They could use the Facail Action Coding System as a lie detector. Doing this could help reduce crime rate, and it could help lock away people that deserve to be put in jail rather than innocent people.

Not only could the Facial Action Coding System help the law, but it could also help in schools. According to the paragraph, it can notify teachers when students are becoming bored of what is being taught. By the teachers being notified that their way of teaching isn't helping the students learn, they would know to change that teaching habit. By the teachers changing their teaching habits and making it more interesting, students would be more likely to learn the information that they are recieving. Rather than just being bored, sleeping, and waiting for the bell to ring. With teachers changing the way that they infrom students, students will recieve better grades. Therefore, the Facial Action Coding System, could help make the students better informed, and no longer just bored of the subject that they are being taught.

Most importantly, the Facail Action Coding System can help with medical conditions. There are many mental medical conditions, but suicide is one of the largest mental conditions. No one really knows that someone is planning to commit this action because they do not notice the signs. I believe that if we were to use the Facial Action Coding System we could detect things like this faster, and do something about it before something tragic happens. Yes, we humans are able to detect when someone is feeling bad, but we are not always able to tell whether or not someone is faking their happiness. According to the paragraph, the Facial Action Coding System can detect when someone is faking a smile. With the Facial Action Coding System being able to detect this it would enable us to know if someone is truly feeling down. The Facial Action Coding System could help reduce the rate of Suicides in todays society, and even in future generations.

Even though the Facial Action Coding System may not be able to help with everything. It could be the solution to many big problems in todays society. It could help with some of the worlds biggest problems. The Facial Action Coding system could help the law reduce crime rate, give students a better education, and it could help with medical conditions.

Not driving a vehicle can have many advantages, such as the driver having a less chance of getting injured on the road because of an accident. You never know if you are going to be safe while behind the wheel. You are always at risk while operating a vehicle. Also you can save money by not driving, you wouldnt have to spend money on a car and also not pay for gas and maitenence of the vehicle. In Paris they had to enforce a partial driving ban so that they could clear the air of the global city. This shows that so much carbon dioxide is let out into the atmosphere.

In bogota, Columbia , an event took place to help cleanse the air in columbia. Two Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event for the first time. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said a buisnessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife. A study found that the driving of young age people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. Younger people may be getting more atheltic and excersising by running or riding a bike.

In conclusion, limiting car usage could be a good thing and help our world. People can save more money, less lives would be at risk and there would be less pollution. I personally think riding a bike to places is fine. People can begin to be getting more fit and healthier by walking, running or riding a bicycle to there destinations. But if where they want to go is to far they can always take a taxi.    ",0,0.006999854,0,True
4267fbae,"In every presidential election, thousands of americans vote for their most favorite candidate, however, most voters feel that their votes don't count because a process called the Electoral College are the ones who are voting. I have heard that since people have been rioting in protest for a change, you the state senator will ask the government to abolish the Electoral College. Unfortunately, we can't let that happen, the Electoral College is very important to presidential elections because provide the certainty of outcome, allows the presidential candidate to have transregional appeal, focus their campaign efforts on the tossup states,and avoid runoff elections. Without the Electoral College, the elections would be a mess.

First, the Electoral College is important because they give the certainty of outcome. For example, the Electoral votes of a winning candidate exceeds the popular votes he gets. While both votes have disputes on the outcome, the Electoral votes very rarely get disputed. For example in 2000 Al Gore had the most popular votes but lost because Bush had more Electoral votes. If there was no Electoral College, the winners of many campaigns would be their opponents.

Next, the Electoral College is important because it requires the presidential candidates to have transregional appeal. For example if a president decided to only do his campaign in one region, there wouldn't be enough electoral votes to give him the win. This means that the candidates have to spread their campaigns throughout the country not only for enough Electoral votes but to have the people in the other regions feel that the president will have regard of their interests.

Next, the Electoral College is important because Allows the candidates to focus their efforts on the tossup states. For example, in tossup states, the voters are more likely to pay attention to the campaign. Because of this, the voters will pick the most respectable of the candidates. Since the Electoral College allows this, people in tossup states will listen to the candidates, review the information about each one and decide on which one to vote for. If it weren't for the Electoral College, the candidates would be clueless on which states would rank up the popular vote.

Finally, the Electoral College is important because it avoids runoff elections. For example the Electoral College avoids the problem of all candidates not getting a majority of the votes. If there is a runoff election, it would complicate the entire process, but since there is an Electoral College, they provide a clear winner.

If there was only popular votes, the change of runoff elections would go up causing problems in the election.

Many people in this country also believe that the Electoral College is important, however many others do not. I am a person that believes that the Electoral College is needed because of certainty of outcome, requiring the candidates to have transregional appeal, focus their campaign efforts on the tossup states, and avoiding runoff elections. I write this letter to you, the state senator to not give up hope on the Electoral College. Without it, elections in our country just wouldn't be right for everyone.",0,0.006765972,0,True
B526FB8B0323,I think the Facial Action Coding System is valuable in a classroom because it helps the student get a better understanding of the lesson. For example if a student is confused about what to do the computer will detect this and modify the lesson so that the student would be more successful. In my opinion i think this would help out alot in the classroom because many students get confused or bored while doing work and most of the time its because they do not understand. with the new technology this would limit confused students and may save the teacher the time of having to explained the instructions again. it may also prevent the student from giving up or recieving a bad grade on the assignment due to preforming poorly. Although we can determine another human's emotions sometimes it is difficult because a person might smile at you but may be hurt inside so you may take this as if the person is ok. the person may also have mixed emotions which gives a person a different emotion instead of the correct emotion or how the person is really feeling. However with the computer you'll never br mistaken and can always find out a person real expression regardless if they are forcing a smile or not. In the article it states that when a person smiles muscles called the zygomatic major will lift the corner of their mouth and when a person is forcing a smile their mouth strectch sideways instead of upward. but how would a teacher know the difference if they are not aware of this. This new technology helps out with that and makes things better not only for the student but for the teacher as well.,0,0.0068847127,0,True

Also in this town there are only two places to park and this means that 70% of the population there down own cars and 57% sold their cars to live there. People in this town say that living there with no cars relieves stress.

In the city of Paris after days of pollution they made a ban on driving to fix the smog.

On mondays motorist that had even number license plates were told not to drive or face a $31 dollar fine. On the next day odd number license plate couldnt drive. 4,000 people were fined and 27 had their cars impounded do to their reaction to the fine. Their were a couple exceptions like plug-in cars, hybrids, also cars carrying more then three people but they make plubic transit free from Monday to Friday.

These acts are happening in countries like Colombia. In Bogota, Colombia they celebrate their third year where cars have been banned with the onmly motor transportation being buses and taxis. They call this day ""The day without cars"" in the capital city which has about 7million poeple. They are doing this to pormote other mean of transportation and violators adn fined $25. A lot of people like to participate in this because it lowers air pollution and stress. Because of this day this city has made 118 miles of bike paths.

In America scientist have found that people 16- to -39 years old are not etting their license. With this drop scientist think that pollution will go down in America. In 2005 the number of miles was at its peak and dropped steadily after that. In April of 2013 the number of miles driven per person was 9% below the peak and is even with the the amount in 1995.

So far we are the only school to embrace this new idea. Now i know some of you probably dont like sports and enjoy reading and writing and all of the other work we do in class. Yes that work is important but being active is also important. Some of you probably think that your not as good as the rest of the kids so you would not be ably to make the team but you should try anyways because you might surprise your self. There is so many sports in the world so if you dont like one or your not good at one then just try another one. Even if you cant find one you like then you could always just invent a new one. It might even become a huge hit and then that could be your job or you could sell the idea off to some big sports company. If i were going to chose or had to chose a sport in would be either basket ball baseball or football because your mostly active all the time in those sports and your always running around. Well maybe football basketball or baseball is not your thing. Maybe you like golfing swimming or even wrestling.

And those are just the sports i cant believe i havent told you that you could be part of the student council. I dont know much about that kind of stuff so i really cant help you there but i recommend that you join that if your not going to take part in any sports. i assume that its like helping out your town or school or like a nursing home or something like that. Or it could be managing your schools activities and events and meetings. I dont really think that would be that much fun but to some people that might be the time of there life.

A3A00BA86199,"Studies have proven that 80% of students who have been involved in a technology-enhanced class from home, have been unsuccessful. With over a million kids in the U.S, an online class or video conference is a non-beneficial program that is being varied in present time. Many students who are not eligible to manage their necessities, are growing down the failure path. The belief that students who partake in online classes from home is invalid, due to the fact that students can evolve to become unproductive and unhealthy.

Each day students become more equipped with technology and their time becomes unproductive. Since most of their time is being used up home, many sources become a distraction. Technology, which grows immensely everyday, can make students fall off topic with their online class. Due to the program not being used wisely, students can take the easy way out and cheat through the class. Most students grow relationships with their teachers who they see everyday; however, students are not obtaining the same beneficial education as if they were to sit down and have it taught to them. An online class is not being explained or brought upon the way a professional would teach it. Attending an online class can be taken advantage of and your work ethic submerges. Which is why the productiveness of students attending an online class is unsatisfactory.

Sitting at home all day can become unhealthy, mentally and physically. Without any socialization with peers or teachers, students may start to feel lonely or stressed out. Having no physical contact, students have no trusted adult for communication, which affects their mental state. Being isolated, while taking an online course, can grow anxiety and depression. As much as student can be affected mentally, they are as well affected physically. A huge percentage of students attend school and return straight home once it ends. If those students were to began online classes, they would be sitting at home all day which becomes physically unhealthy to your body. Online courses promotes laziness for students who are not active or have non-related school interest and extracurricular activities.

Many students who are responsible enough are able to manage their time and succeed with online classes. The idea that students who benefit from online classes is successful due to their independence and time management.

As students grow they become more independent of their work and time management. Since they are able to have their own time at home, they can become more trustworthy of their needs. Students grow to become their own person by prospering from online classes.

Overall, the belief that students who partake in online classes from home is invalid, due to the fact that students can evolve to become unproductive and unhealthy. Taking online classes has many disadvantages. Students are not learning in a resourceful matter and do not have a way to portray what they have learned. While they are at home with no social interactions they began to feel alone and walk down the laziness path.

That's like taking everything they have. What if kids want to become good at something, but now they cant because of that school policy. If they have a C average they should still be able to go out for sports or activities. A C average isn't that bad, its higher then a D average. If the school police was if you have a D average of lower they shouldn't do sports or activities. If they have a D average in school for not working hard, that's means that they in ain't going to try hard. If they have a C average and there trying hard they should be able to out for sports or activities.

Doing an extracurricular activity can help the students learn new things about their self. For an example I have always thought basketball was a boring and pointless sport but when I saw others playing in this sport I ended up giving it a chance and started playing this sport. I eventually started to like this sport but it took some time getting use to, now it's the only thing I can think about all day.

Most students get really bored and have nothing to do in their extra time and when students have extra time they just sit around and complain how that there is nothing to do but if a student does a extracurricular activity they will engage in much more activites and not be as bored than before.

CDF6072AB1D6,"The Case of the Driveless Cars

How many movies have you seen that depict the future with advanced technology such as holograms or even driveless cars? How much of a reality could that be? The case of driveless cars has been something that has been going on for awhile. Even around 2009 Google came out with their first almost driveless car. Although driveless cars are depicted as futuristic and magical, really driveless cars seem like more of an endangerment to our economy, our safety and our time.

To begin, the manufacturing of driveless cars is insanely expensive. Where would all this money even come from? We would have to fund it to provide research for a car that doesn't know how to back out of a driveway yet. There has already been 200 million dollars spent on radar a device on a hiltop. So why waste money on something that only goes up to 25 mph and won't even drive if you don't have your hands on the wheel? It seems like driveless really just means assissting. But assissting to who? Obviously not the wallets of the buyers.

Secondly, the driveless cars are supposed to help for the better of the people, they say it would be ""safer"". But where is the proof that it is safer? Many states have already banned the use of any self-autonomous cars, just leaving out four states who have left them limited use to test out the cars. How can the world just expect for these cars to be safe when we already have superstition over these cars and those who don't will barely let them use the cars too? They also suggest since the driver will probably be bored that they should put in some entertainment in the car. But what happens when, the car stops and has the driver do what they're supposed to, but they aren't prepared because they were entertained by something else? It's unsafe to assume that having all these distracting things around people who are supposed to be driving won't effect how they do in a sudden situation. There is also the hastle of having to reconstruct the roads, which goes back to the point of money and also safety. It is never safe when there is construction going around, especially when they have to reconstruct the whole road in order to make the driveless cars work. This also leads to the third point.

Time is very limited in this day and age. We barely have time to do anything, we have so many errands to run, so many things to do, but it's like we never have enough time. If the expansion of driveless cars would continue we would have to reconstruct the roads, delaying many people with getting to work or going to school, or just everyday things. Then we have to go to the government too, to repeal the ban put over on many states. So, naturally, that will take forever too, because when does the government ever get such controversial things solved super quick? Why waste the time of millions for something we aren't sure of yet?

All in all, the manufacturing of driveless cars is pointless when the car isn't even really driveless. It seems more of a hazard to the economy, the safety of many, and the time of others than it does as an ensuring safe way to get around. In the case of the driveless car, the driveless car lost. There are too many negative effects for it to ever succeed.   ",0,0.008022248,0,True

buying video games, and shopping. and looking for technology as a way to communicate which can limit the opportunities to use verbal communication.

I strongly disagree with this statement on the use of technology, because it limits the amount of outside interactions and technology can do everything for you. For example, now people mostly use text as a way to communicate with someone through social media. using only this form of communication can limit the use of verbal communication with a person. Resulting in negative relationships with a person causing misunderstandings and negative relationships. avioding verbal interactions is very bad for somone. Technology can also be damaging for the health.

Technology be both physically and emotionally unhealthy. For Instance the use of so much technology can damage the eyes and can cause brain damage this can result to unhealthy problems in the future. On the other hand people think that by using there phones, tablets and computers. They do not have to be mobile and do a task by themselves with no technology. By sitting around and not getting up to go out and finish a task can lead to loss of energy and many other physical problems. The lack of day to day verbal communication can cause negative emotions. For instance not verbally talking to people can make someone feel lonely and unhappy.

Using technology as a way to purchase things and avoiding to go to the stores can have some negative outcomes. For Example purchasing an electronic on a website and having it delivered it can result to being broken, missing pieces, and can be the wrong thing this can lead to loss of money and can lead to no possible refunds. people use this as way to shop for food, clothes, and books instead of being able to feel the object or know the quality of the item it self or asking an employee about the items pros and cons.

In conclusion, Many people agree that technology allows them to complete many tasks without having to come in contact with others. as a result Technology has a negative impact on people limiting contact with person to person resulting to negative impacts on there day to day life, Although, technology is smart it is always best idea is to be able to do things more off technology and using more verbal communication with a people rather then a phone or computer using verbal communication is a best way to being positive out comes and being able to go to a store instead of relying on technology.",0,0.0073005417,0,True

However, a time will come when you have to make a difficult decision that could affect many things in your life. In these situations, people tend to turn to their friends and family for advice. Before making the final decision, it is best to collect the opinions of multiple people. Seeking advice from more than one person will benefit you as everyone has different experiences and opinions, and you will learn the pros and cons of different views.

The first reason you should talk to different people before making an important decision is everybody has a different experiences an opinions. For example, if you are deciding where you want to go to collage and you ask your uncle, a James Madison University graduate, where he thinks you should go, he will most likely try to convince you that JMU is the best option. However, if you ask your aunt, a University of Virginia graduate, she will probably give reasons why you should attended UVA and not JMU.

It is important to talk to multiple people so you can better understand different perspectives and experiences.

The second reason getting advice from multiple people is helpful is you can understand both the pros and cons of your options. People are biased because of their experiences, and this can lead them to tell you the wonderful things about their opinions and the horrible things about otherÃÂ´s ideas. If you only ask one person for advice, you will only get half an opinion. This will leave you as misinformed as an inexperienced child. Collecting advice from many people allows you to hear positive and negative points about your choices.

It will give you more knowledge about your decision and help you feel more comfortable with your final decision.

The election of the president should be based on popular vote because it is unfair that not everyones votes count, their is a chance of a tie breaking out, and the disaster factor because so much could go wrong. Although it seemed like a good idea at the time, it is unfair and irrational to all voters in the United States.

It is injustice that not everyones votes count under the Electoral College. The process of the Electoral College consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president, and the counting of votes by congress. Voters are directly related to this because the popular vote of a state usually gets the electoral vote of the state. This is good for the majority but what about the minority. The Electoral College is a winner-take-all system so their voice does not get heard. If a voter is democratic in Texas it would be a waste of time voting, because  most of texas is republican and the 38 votes would go twords a republican. If it was based on popular voting then the minority would get a say and could help.

One of the most worrying situations is the prospect of a tie in electoral votes. Because the Electoral College is made up of an even 538 electors, Their is the possiblilty of a tie. If that were to happen, then the electin would be thrown into the House of Representitives, where state delegations would vote on the president. This would be a problem because some states, such as Wyoming, would only get one or two votes but others, like California, would get more than thirty. Also, the House of Representitives would vote for the canidate they want, not reflecting the will of the people at all. If a tie seems unrealistic, just remember in 1968, 41,971 votes would have created a complicated mess.

Moreover, their is the disaster factor, Their are many problems and kinks in the system and some of these can destroy the system. The worst one we ever expiriednced is the recounts in Florida in 2000. The state legislature could always pick electors that will defy the people. In 1960, the Louisiana state legislature almost changed Democratice electors with ones that would vote againts John F. Kennedy. Also in 1960, Hawaii sent two states of electors to congress. Perhaps the worst is a party's canidate casting a vote for whomever they please, ignoring the people. This is one of the biggest downsides of the Electorial College.

The Electorial college is no longer usefull or democratic. If instead we vote the president on popular vote we won't expirience the unfairness to voters, the problems of a tie, or the disaster factor. It can help in some situations but for the most part is spurious at best. The Electorial College is outdated, unfair, and non- democratic and should be replaced by a popular vote.

32440040C61B,"If schools offered online classes regularly to students, I believe many students scores will begin to jump off the charts. I have friends and family who have taken online classes, they all scored well and loved completing assignments in their beds. Some students may like going to in school classes, but this is not the case fore everyone. Students would love to do a project at home in their pajamas, it's a lot more relaxing. Although some may disagree, attending class from home could truly be beneficial.

As a student, if you were to attend class from home, this could be helpful in many ways. If you were completing your work in your living room, you would be learning in your own environment. For example, every class has one kid that is very loud. Loud learning environments can make it hard to focus; furthermore, can cause test scores to decrease. Also, if you have class and you are sitting right next to your best friend, you're not going to get much work done. While attempting to work with friends, you may begin to joke around and slack off. So, being at home can help you focus on completing your task individually. In some cases, a few students need to learn at their own pace. If a teacher is speeding through the lesson plan, it can be very hard to comprehend the information. Sometimes students need to go over it a few times to fully understand the lesson. Although, if the lesson was online, you could go over it as many times as you need to. Sometimes, students learn better individually. They possibly could learn better while working without teachers, parents, or friends. If a student was having trouble making friends at school, it wouldnt be right to force him or her to work with a group of unfamiliar faces. Also, students could like to challenge there selves by not getting any help. When they complete the task individually , the students could feel as if they accomplished something. Which may give them a boost of confidence while working.

There are a few more ways on how attending online classes can be beneficial. It can be a hassle trying to complete a project within a span of a hour and a half. Being able to work on your project throughout different times of the day will be more relaxing and give your brain a break. Sometimes, in school having a lot of work to complete in a short time period can just be tiring and hard on students.

While completing assignments sometimes your teacher does not explain it in the best ways. Taking classes online will make you available to receive help from multiple sources. For example, my mother has two degrees in math. So, if there is a new concept that i don't understand, she would be the best person to explain it to me. Also, my grandma taught biology for over 30 years, so she also could share her knowledge with me to help me understand. One of the most important reasons, it is tough to learn on a empty stomach. Certain classes in schools will not let you eat , like a science lab or computer lab. It's very tough to focus on a test if you have not eaten since breakfast and you have the last lunch of the day. During the test, you are only thinking about what you have packed for lunch. Taking online classes can fix this, you can eat all day whenever and wherever you would like.

Although some may disagree, attending class from home could truly be more beneficial. Online classes could improve scores by students being allowed to learn in their own environment, learn at there own pace, learn individually, complete work at different times throughout the day, have different sources of help,and being able to eat while learning. Students may like attending in school classes, but online classes would be a lot better. Overall, letting the students choose they way they want to learn will be the key to success, so online classes should be offered for any student who would like to request it.",0,0.0075120633,0,True
04effeb0,"Dear Senator, Many people might agree theat we shouldn't have an Electoral College at all, since most of thee time it doesn't seem to work at all since of instead just voting on thee person or candidate you would prefer, you instead vote for a slate of electors instead of thee preferred candidate. This is not thee case, however, and in fact, thee Electoral College does seem to function. It can be proven in two simple reasons on why thee Electoral College still works certainty of outcome and thee simple fact theat it's everyone's president.

Foremost, thee certainty of outcome can easily prove why thee Electoral College still works. If we even do go to a system where we actually vote for popular vote, it would work as well as we do right now withe thee Electoral College, since theere will be more disputes on popular vote thean on thee Electoral College. In Richard A. poster's article on thee defense for thee Electoral College, he states in his first reason on why theeir would be much dispute over popular vote thean on thee Electoral College, and why it's less likely to happen on a Electoral College. He states ""The reason is theat thee winning candidate's share of thee Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of thee popular vote."" It's true, after all theat thee Electoral College's votes exceed over thee popular votes. It could be also said theat even if thee government actually switches to popular vote, we know it would work since it does not exceed how on Electoral College votes go, which can be also seen as a simpler process of voting. On anotheer note, in some cases, theere can be ties between two candidates, as seen in 1992's Election between Nixon and Clinton on thee popular vote. To summarize, thee certainty of outcome is far greater in thee Electoral College ratheer thean thee popular vote due to sheer number of votes in thee Electoral College.

On a second note, thee fact theat thee american people can vote enough theat it's everyone's president is anotheer reason on why thee Electoral college does work. The Electoral College works by havng thee winner win transregionally ratheer thean just focus on just on region theat just favors theem and only theem. So instead of one region getting thee candidate theat prefers and focuses on only theem, everyone can have a candidate theat will focus largely on thee nation's issues ratheer thean just a specific part ot thee country. For example, let's say theat thee largest population of people in a regon in thee United States is thee southe not saying it is or isn't, it's just an example. The southe is mainly republican, so theey will only vote for a republican theat will focus majorly on thee southe. It is unfair for thee rest of thee regions, such as thee Northeeast, Middle, Pacific, and otheer regions of thee United States, since theey are mainly democratic not really, it is used as an example who would want focus on theeir region as well, too. In Bradford plumber's article on why thee Electoral College should be gone, he states theat thee electoral college is unfair to voters, since most candidates did not botheer withe thee states theey know theey have no chance of winning at all. There could be an easy counter argument against theis, since theose states have probably already made up theeir minds on who to vote for, like a democratic candidate visiting Texas where it's mainly republican, theey know who Texas is going to vote for, theere is no use in trying to convince theem when theey have already made up theeir minds, same goes if a republican candidate tries to convince thee democratic California, theey already know theere is no use in reasoning and convincing when someone has already made up theeir mind. Also, someone can easily counterattack most of thee arguments brought up in the plumber's article, since theis was written before thee 2004 election, and it has been a decade already, plenty of theings could've changed during thee course if ten years in politics. In order to make a greater argument against thee electoral college, one must have an updated list of facts in order to back it up, as certain theings could've changed during a certain course of a decade. During thee course of a decade, we seen how affective thee electoral college was during thee 2004 elections people who disagreed during thee 2004 elections and also agree theat thee electoral college doesn't work at all have to see thee events theat transpired before thee 2004 elections and thee promises made before it also, thee 2008 elections again, if thee people disagreed on how thee electoral college worked at theat time, you would need to look at how people saw change during theat time and thee amount of younger citizens voting at theat time, and thee 2012 elections as well also again, if disagreeing withe thee electoral college is reasonable at theat time, you would need to look at how people reacted at theat time and how different events before thee election affected thee outcome. In a final note, thee electoral college is thee vote on thee people's president is true, and witheholds it since it can focus on ratheer thean on one specific region, but thee nation as a whole.

In summarization, thee electoral college should be kept due to thee simple reasoning of certainty of outcome and thee voting on thee people's president. The reasoning of certainty of outcome can be applied here is due to thee simple fact theat thee votes for thee electoral college are far more greater thean thee votes for popular vote, same goes to thee voting on thee people's president, since it focuses on thee entire nation ratheer theat just one region of thee country. Senator, we should be able to keep our electoral college, as it proves effective during thee recent elections, and can certainly prove itself useful and reliable during thee next elections to come.",0,0.0076247845,0,True
BA007250F304,"Did you know that over eighty percent of the population asks more than one person when they tend to ask questions? I believe that it is helpful to seek more then one person because one many people could have experienced it, two other people may have a different answer, and three I believe that it is a good idea to ask more than one person because they might just be wrong or right or they might have no clue what your talking about at all.

My reasons for my statements up above are one because that person may have experienced it and may just know what you are talking about. My reasons to support this are one if you simply ask more than one person you may get a better answer because they may or may not know what you are talking about, two if they experienced it they may not a lot about the topic and how they can help you, and my last statement about this is that if they experienced it rather than not at all you could always do research about it more and maybe asking more people could increase your social skills more. In conclusion to this paragraph I believe that you should always ask more than one person because they might just have a good feeling that they know what your talking about.

However, I also believe that as well as what I just said I think that you may get a better answer to support this is if you simply ask one person they might not even know at all, two you could always ask more and get a better answer and sum it up more to answer it, and finally, my last reason to support it is that one person you decided to ask might not even be right at all. In conclusion I believe that you should ask everyone because that one person might not be right plus you never know you may get a good answer.

My last reason to support this is that is you ask more than one person you could have a high chance of increasing you social skills by a lot, two if asking more people increases the chances of your answer actually being right, and finally it is always good t ask more than one person because they could have just honestly tell you a lot about it if it is something they know a lot about.

In conclusion,

I believe that it is never a bad idea to ask more than one person a question or and idea.

I believe the main idea or thesis of my topic is that it is a good idea to ask more than one person a opinion or an idea because they could just simply know more about it or they could just give a more honest opinion about it.

The lesson you can learn from this is that you should always ask more than one person about a question or just a simple opinion because they could honestly just know more depending on what your talking bout while if you just ask one person it can be just a twenty percent chance either they know it or not. You should listen to me about what I have to say because why would you risk the chance of just asking one person about a question they might not even know about at all? Or why even waste your time on something when you do not even know if they lied about it even being true or not or even knowing about it.

If you do not listen to me and just ask one person then good luck actually looking for the answer you want with only a twenty percent of someone even knowing what you are talking about or them not even giving you what you want or the correct answer. In conclusion, you should just really ask more than one person to get what you are really looking for and that might just improve some skills along with social skills.",0,0.006920027,0,True

And there is way to much mercury on the plant. The plant havs a rocky surface. It has valleys and mountanins. It is kinda like earth.

NASA has an idea thst they want to send people up to go and study the plant but not put then not the plant cause you can't land on it. They want them to fly above it and study it.

B75BF6FFD9A2,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I clearly agree with you. I do think that in order to participate in sports or other activities the students should have a C grade average because, I think that students should not let anything come across them and learning. Also because this lets us know that we are falling behind in our school work and its also warning us that we are either failing or barley passing.

Students should focus more on their future than on anything else. If they want to live in the streets its fine, but they warned them. They should be more aware of their knowledge and grades than anything. The sport and competitions, it doesn't matter if you loose or win, its just a game to begin with.

On the other hand, students should have the right to play whatever sport they like, but it's their grade and future, not ours. It's better to let them handle their stuff, and then maybe they'll know that something is wrong. Students should learn how to handle things and do things right. It will be affecting their grade, not anybody else's.

So I state my point, students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have a grade C average. This helps students know that what they are doing is wrong and that they are caring too much about the sport or activity that they do.            ",0,0.00737933,0,True
4F26841CD3C8,"Some schools have begun to offer distance learning as an alternative for students to take classes at home through online or video conferencing. I feel that many students would benefit from a distance learning course because it allows them to learn in a private and comfortable setting, the students would have more time to complete their assignments, and it would allow them to do the work on a more flexible schedule.

First, students would be able to work from the comfort and privacy of their own homes. In doing so many students would have less distractions, due to the fact that there would be very few people to keep them from focusing on their work. They also would not have to worry about being judged for what they wear to their classes because there would be no one to comment on what they are wearing. They could also do the work wherever they feel comfortable, if they really felt like it they could lay in bed and work.

Second, students would be given more time to complete their assignments. With them being given more time to work on the assignments the deadlines, for the assignments, would be even better. Students would not be restrained by a bell schedule to complete their work. And if they have any questions they could talk to their teacher directly rather than having to wait for the teacher to finish with another student.

Third, the schedule for the students would be a lot more flexible than having to go to specific classes at specific times. Students wouldn't have a specific time they are required to be attending their classes. They are able to work on the assignments whenever they have time to. And they can leave the assignment and come back to it at another time, rather than being required to finish one assignment to move onto another.

In conclusion, I feel that schools making distance learning available to all students would help benefit the ability of each and every student because it would allow students who want a more private work environment to do so in the comfort of their own home while also giving the students more time and a more flexible schedule.",0,0.007270214,0,True

I think we should all be required to do at least 3 hours of community service. It would be a great way for everyone to get involved in their community and help others. It looks good if you have community service on your college application. This can help you with your life goals and make you a better person.

We can tell the students about this in a way that makes it sound exciting like giving examples which makes it easier. We could say,' you can clean up trash in your neighborhood with your friends'. This might make it sound more exciting if you say you can do it with a friend. They can also help out at a daycare or assisted living center with their friends too.

Some of the kids say that they don't have time to do community service but they can make time.

28F2073AD0CD,"Many Students dread waking up extremely early every morning to go to school. Some schools have found an alternative for these students by offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it allows them to receive extra help, to learn in a comfortable environment, and to have more free time.

Attending classes online allows students to access help from online teachers and students more easily. By using online classes, students can ask the teacher as many questions as they need without being nervous of other students' opinions. Many students are anxious to raise their hands in school in fear of embarrassment. Younger generations feel very comfortable communicating with others online, so students could ask each other for help too. Video conferencing with teachers also allows one on one help. Teachers can spend more time with a student by giving them extra practice on a topic the student may struggle with. The method of face to face communication through video conferencing provides the same benefits as communicating with a teacher at school. This allows students to thoroughly understand subjects from home.

Learning in a comfortable environment is a major key in education. If students are in the comfort of their own home, whether its sitting on the couch or laying in bed, they are more likely to retain the information learned during class. They can even wake up and participate in classes while still in their pajamas. It is much easier to sit through lectures and participate in class while being comfortable instead of sitting in a sturdy, uncomfortable desk at school. Students do not have to worry about their appearance while using online school. This allows students to roll out of bed and participate in class without worrying about immediately brushing their teeth, taking a shower, or putting on presentable clothes. It also allows kids to participate in class even when they are sick. Learning from home gives students the ability to learn in an environment they feel safe and comfortable in to maximize their education experience.

Many students struggle to find time for extracurricular activities because of school. Online classes opens up more time for students to participate in extracurricular activities such as sports or clubs. Class schedules can be flexible to fit each student's own schedule. This will help balance their school and personal life and reduce stress. A current major issue many students face while in school is the lack of sleep they get. By attending classes from home, students can obtain extra needed sleep. Individuals will function and perform at their highest ability every day by getting the required amount of sleep. Every person is different, so attending classes at home can help students balance school and their own personal interests.

Distance learning allows a lot of benefits for students by taking classes at home. This allows them to obtain extra help, to learn in a safe and comfortable area, and to have more time for their own personal interests. Some students may prefer traditional schooling, however, it is clear that attending classes from home is the best path for many students.",0,0.0065108486,0,True
279E53FA45F6,"In the passage, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus', the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit for scientists. The author includes many advantages and disadvantages in the passage. The author is very good at explaing why and how we can acheive this goal. He also explains his stance very clearly, offering advice and explaining both sides. Venus is very much alike to Earth, yet scientists have yet to truly understand the planet. While there are some challenges that his idea presents, there are more benefits and advantages. Exploring and continuing to study Venus would benefit us greatly, both in the present, and in the future.

The author says that studying Venus would be beneficial for many reasons. One being that Venus is very much alike to Earth. The author states that ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system"". He says that both planets share many important qualities that we as humans, need for survival. He states that ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of like, just like Earth"" and ""Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. This information shows that Venus and Earth are similar and with more knowledge about the planet, they could possibly visit Venus in the future.

Another reason why Venus should be further explored is to further our knowledge and our basis of understanding. The author says in the passage that ""Human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."". He also says that ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"". This is very true. Struggles and obstacles in our way or obtaining knowledge should not prevent us from continuing forever, but should motivate us to find another way to acheive our goal. Although there may be obstacles that seem impossible to overcome, scientists can and will overcome them. Continuing to study Venus will acheive just this concept.

How we are going to visit Venus without getting injured by the elements is simple. Although Venus has many obstacles that will make it hard for us to come in contact and learn more, NASA has a great solution. The author says that by creating a type of vehicle that could hover just over the Venusian landscapes, scientists would be able to study Venus safely. Being at a certain height above the planet would prevent unsurvivable conditions and make it bearable for humans to be there. The author does say however, that because they are so high, their vision would be limited. This idea is favorable and definetly acheivable in the near future.

In conclusion, studying Venus is a very worthy pursuit. The author gives many benefits for the continuation of studying Venus and he also gives reasoning as to why and how we can do it. He supports his idea very well with immense amoun of evidence to back up his claim. The universe is hugely immeasurable and Venus is the next door neighbor to Earth. While scientists have access to improving technology and while they have the resources to do so, they should take action towards studying Venus.         ",0,0.007313983,0,True
a47cee9d,"Dear Mr. Senator, I am writing you concerning a topic that is very important to our country, and the citizens that preside in it. The electoral college is the current method of determining who will be elected as the president of the United states of America. As you know, it does so by allowing our citizens to vote for electors that then choose who they want as president for us. Citizens will most often vote for an elector that has sworn to vote for either the democratic or republican party's candidates for president. However, I don't quite agree with this method of election. Through my research on this subject, I have discovered that not only do these citizens not have the access to vote directly for who they want to run their country, but also that many electors go back on their word and vote for another party's candidate. I believe the system should be changed and the president should be elected through popular vote, and I'm not alone, according to a gallop poll taken in 2000, over 60% of the population agrees with me.

If the popular vote elects the president, every citizen will have their own choice on who they want as a president. In an electoral college, many people will merely have their votes casted aside becausetheir decisions or thoughts aren't the same as eveyone else in their state. Though some people say an electoral college is positive because it requires the candidate have more than just regional appeal, but if people in that state like a specific candidate, even if they vote for an elector, the rest of their state may not like that candidate, and that person's vote will be cast away.

Also, the electoral college doesn't always follow the peoples' vote. For example, if there were to be a tie in the electoral college, the election would be given to the House of Representatives. Since many people vote for a different party candidate than who they vote for, for the House of Representatives, they would not get their vote for president counted for anything, and the House may choose the president they don't want, without getting a say in any of it. Not to mention the 2000 election when Al Gore got more votes overall, but Bush won the presidency due to the unfair, outdated system of the electoral college. The electoral college puts the decision of who will be the president into a couple hundred peoples' hands, instead of every American citizen.

Another reason for changing the method to popular vote is the fact that all of the electors count the same. Since each state only counts for one electoral vote, the one elector from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, will count for the same as the 55 electors from, California, who represent 35 million voters. That simply isn't fair because it's the same as saying the opinions of only 500,000 voters in Wyoming are as influencial and important as the entire 35 million voters' opinions from California. The fact that not all American citizens, promised to be able to vote for who will lead their country and influence their everyday life, are able to do so is absurd.

Many people argue and say that just one vote won't make a difference, but there are 34,500,000 people in California alone that are being disregarded and not counted for anything more than the 500,000 in Wyoming.

Why should the people living in smaller states have more influence than those with larger populations? Why shouldn't those 34.5 million people in California be able to make their own decision and choose their own vote for the President? The entire population of every single state in the United States of America, that has the legal right to do so, should be able to vote, and to have their vote actually counted for something instead of just having their decision made for them by someone they've never even met. With the popular vote deciding who will be president, everyone will matter just the same, which is how it should be since we are all created equal, and we all should have the equal power to decide how our country will be governed and who will govern it, we should all be counted not just the small percentage that is at the top.

Some classes teach you about tecnology so i think it would be helpful and a good example to show around.

I know that I would love to do that, but the principal thinks that us students should partake in a extracurricular activities. I don't like the idea of that, but he is right. Students should take part in extracurricular activities. If kids just stay inside and play video games or watch videos on YouTube or Disney+, we could grow up to be dependent on other people, we wouldn't be strong, and maybe become very violent.

The first reason why kids should take part in extracurricular activities is because if they just play video games and watch videos on YouTube, Disney+, Netflix, or Hulu, they could get lazy and depend on somebody else to do things for him. This also ties in to the fact that I said that they wouldn't be fit or strong. If they spend their whole life not doing anything productive, they won't be very strong and if somebody asks that kid to lift something up, they may not be able to do it.

Since I already talked about the second reason why kids should takes part in activities, lets take about the last reason. Some movies, videos, and video games are very violent like Call of Duty or GTA. Kids that play those type of games may think that all that stuff is normal and become violent. They may start to say bad things or destroy stuff. If we let them play many different activities, they they may develop teamwork skills and make friends.

287F79B6D6F6,"After a long and tiring day at school, students often look forward to returning home to retire in a stress-free environment. People's homes remind them that their strenuous day of work has come to an end and that they can now comfortably enjoy their home alongside the company of their family and friends. Students have come to have a negative perception of school as it exhausts their energy and causes them stress. But what happens when they choose to attend their institution from the comfort of their home? Does their home, a prior safe heaven from school, gain a more stressful connotation? School and home are two very important, but separate, institutions that students should not make the mistake of combining. Therefore, students will not benefit from attending online classes at home as they will get easily distracted and be less motivated to learn.

First, students will not benefit from attending online classes at home as they will get easily distracted. Students are often young and their brains have the power to rapidly grasp and process information. However, this ability can be negatively affected especially when the student is in an environment that they are well acquainted with. A well known area where students have limited interactions can dull their curiosity and aspirations for learning, causing boredom. This boredom is able to take over a young student's malleable mind and replace curiosity with distraction. In a world where technology is ubiquitous and can bring the world to one's fingertips, students would much rather research the latest scores of a basketball game or catch up on celebrity gossip, than they would learn about the Pythagorean theorem. At home, a student's mind is able to roam around freely, especially without an instructor prohibiting such distractions. Making it less likely that students are being attentive to the subject being taught on an online forum that limits their participation in the class. Therefore, students will not benefit from attending online classes at home as they will get easily distracted by the comforts in their home.

Another reason students will not benefit from attending online classes at home is that they will be less motivated to learn. Many students will agree that a commonly enjoyed perk of going to school is to meet and mingle with friends. However, when students study on an online forum at home, they do not get this opportunity to engage in conversations with peers as there are lesser chances to forge a personal bond with the students in the class. If learning online removes some of the greatest opportunities a student has to establish bonds and friendships, is it really worth it? Students need to know the faces and personalities of the people in their classes to gain a confident observation of each of their classmates' beliefs. Lighthearted conversations with one's peers are a key to developing relationships, and without the assistance of such relationships, students are likely to lack motivation in their goals and studies. Additionally, students will lack motivation in their coursework if they have less need to participate during lectures. An online study forum greatly hinders a student's ability to communicate with peers and take part in group discussions. These discussions are essential for a student's success in core classes as they captivate the student and make them play an active role in the class. Being an active learner provides students with the necessary skills to communicate with the professor and their peers, as well as to actively observe the essential components that are being discussed in the classroom's environment. The lack of opportunity to discuss topics with another student can create an uninteresting perception of that class and make students less inclined to partake in class activities and lectures. Therefore, students will not benefit from attending classes at home as they will be less motivated to partake in the class when their abilities to create relationships and be an active learner are hindered.

In conclusion, students will not benefit from attending online classes at home as they will get easily distracted and be less motivated to learn. If students are to properly balance their home life and their studies, a more reasonable approach that doesn't compromise their relaxation or student life needs to be found. Also, students who attempt to take an online class at home are more likely to be distracted by the comforts that are at their reach. The inability to forge relationships and connect with peers is another drawback of taking an online class at home. Likewise, the lack of opportunities to partake in in-class discussions creates barriers for students to succeed as active learners. Nobel Peace Prize winner and educational activist Malala Yousafzai once said,""a paper and pen can change the world."" Yousafzai overcame many hindrances before she could provide education to the girls in her village, so why do we undermine its importance?

489d3798,"We should keep with changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Because it is logical and is very fair, these are my reasons why.

For one, it seems a lot more leveled out. The Electoral College is not as fair, because the electors help the president, the the president helps the electors. They could have past experience or an old relationship of some sort. bradford Plumer quotes, ""The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" He clearly says Electoral College needs to be abolished, over & done with.Because they don't have logical information on everything they do. And they only have practical reasoning, not liberal or conservative reasoning.

Next reason, their method is not bulletproof as they claim it to be. No method is perfect, but the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope in succeeding. Richard A. Posner quotes, ""Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote..."" He is saying the way the method is set up, makes it seem worthless to even vote for the person you choose or chose.

Finally, my last reason to why we should keep with changing to election by popular vote is confusion.The Electoral College is unfair to voters. Some candidates don't spend time in states the know they have no chance of winning because of the winnertakeall system. Richard A. Posner quotes, ""During 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" That is pretty selffish and ridiculously unfair.

However, having the election by popular vote has it's flaws as well. Such as the certainty of outcome. Electoral College having a dispute over the outcome of an election is possible, but it's less likely than the popular vote. Richard A. Posner quotes, ""Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winnertakeall basis, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoralvote victory in that state."" He is simply stating that if there is a difficulty in the popular vote election, they have an electoral vote to choose the winner.

Those are my very important, detailed reasons why we should change to election by popular vote. Recap, fairness is important & is needed in any method, the Electoral College method is not as solid as they believe it to be, & all of the confusion the Electoral College puts off to some states.",0,0.0073699476,0,True

I think that students should have the choice to do community service. I think the only time a student should be forced to do community service is when their being punished. Most students might have too much to do for community service. If there too busy doing community service the students might not be able to take care of there more important responsibilities. Students might have homework or house chores to do.

I think you should let the students that want to do community service do it. If they're always doing community service, when will the students be able to have time to enjoy for themselves. Doing community service takes a lot of time out of a persons day. If there was a test a student had to take the next day after doing community service when schools over and if that student spent a lot of time to do that, then when that student got home, he would be restless and probably wouldn't have enough time to study for that test. I just don't think that community service is healthy for a lot of kids learning environments. So, this concludes my theory on students doing community service.

Over the past week, I have heard that you might be requiring all students to participate in community service. As our community is relatively dirty, and has a lot of trash and litter everywhere, I certainly think that all students should participate in community service at least once over the school year. I think that the town certainly needs a clean-up and this is a great way to do it. Of course, most students have busy schedules, and may not be able to participate in it on a certain day. As a community, we need to take care of it ourselves and therefore, all students should be required to take part at least once over the year. I would be willing to help you, and maybe could be the assistant in the community service.

The town of LOCATION_NAME has some very disgusting neighborhoods and this causes water pollution, air pollution, and any other type of pollution you can think of. This causes diseases and other sicknesses that could possibly be fatal. Well, as it is our community, I definitely think that we need to do a large pick-up at least several times a year. For example, in the neighborhood of Trianon, families will take out the trash and then it will blow away, and they don't care one bit. If a neighbors pet eats something that blew away, you could get sued and the pet could get very sick.

As some students have a busy schedule, they may not be able to take part in some of the days where we do community service. Therefore, I think you should definitely make ten or more days where students can come out and do something good for the community. I will go out and find who can do what on which days as the assistant in this. From there on, you and I could make a schedule for days on which most kids could do the community service.

Finally, I would be asking you to allow me to be the your assistant in this job. I have done a community service before and know how to get it done properly.

The Electoral College is an unfair process. With multiple presidents winning the popular vote and losing their presidency, it is nondemocratic. Myself, along with many other people across the state, believe that elections should be based on popular vote rather than the decisions of 538 electors. Although the Electoral College has its advantages, I believe that a majority vote by the people of the United States would be more accurate as well as fair.

The Electoral College is a winner-takes-all system, meaning that candidates spend lots of time campaigning in the ""swing"" states rather than others. In 2000, seventeen states didn't even get to see the candidates. This means that almost 34% of voters didn't get a real feel for who they will be casting their votes for. Even though presidents should focus their time on big states with larger populations, it is unfair to the smaller states who don't get any visits from their candidates.

With the Electoral College system, voters vote for a slate of electors, rather than the presidents themselves. This means that when you cast your vote for Barack Obama ,for example, you are not voting for him. you are actually voting for a certain number of electors who contribute to the candidate's electoral votes. Electors can be anyone not in public office and they are usually chosen by the state. This is a corrupt system because the electors could be anyone, and change their ideas to not reflect the views of the people. In 1960, Louisiana legislature segregationists almost replaced all of the Democratic electors electors with new Kennedy-opposing electors. The errors and problems in this system could be much greater, and goverment officials must be monitoring it at all times.

In the event of an Electoral College tie, the president election decision would be given to the House of Representatives, and the vice-president decision to the Senate. This doesn't seem too terribly bad, but one representative from Wyoming would be representing 500,000 voters, and would have as much say as the 55 representatives representing 35 million people inhabiting California. This is not fair because of the widespread views of people in each state. There cannot be one candidate that the whole state agrees on, as people's ideas differ across the states.

There are many reasons to keep, as well as dispose of the Electoral College. The negatives outweigh the positives and a popular vote would be more democratic. We are supposed to be a democracy, and democracies thrive on the views of the people instead of electors.

8f89a4be,"Dear Florida state senator, The Electoral College may seem like a great thing to have but I think it may not be the best idea. There are plenty of reasons and one of them is that it is kind of unfair that we really don't get to vote. We vote to see who is more popular with the people but if the Electoral College wants someone else, they can vote for the person they want. People think they are voting and no one else is making the decision for them but they are being lied to. It is an unfair way of voting and is is nondemocratic way in most people's eyes.

Although, most of the time the voters get who they voted for, it happened to not be that way one time. In 2000, Gore had more popular votes than Bush but Bush won because he had more electoral votes and the people were angry. The Electoral College didn't go with what the voters wanted, but what they themselves wanted. People are being lied to that they have a say so in who should be president. Yes, most of the time they go with the voters but at any time they can disregard the popular votes and vote for who they want. If that's the case then no one should vote since they basically only have an opinion on who should be elected.

I said it was a nondemocratic way before and it really is. It isn't really a free way of voting, we give an opinion and the Electoral College votes for whoever. It fits back when America was just becoming America, but it is too old now. When the Declaration of independence was made and a little while after that is what time era I think it should have died out. It is other people voting for us. In America, we have a voice, we can state opinions, we can vote too, but the Electoral College votes for us. It is telling our opinion, it is telling who we want, but why can't we have direct voting? It just isn't fair to the voters because they aren't really voting, just expressing an opinion.

Speaking of unfair, the number of electoral votes each state gets is outrageously unfair! Why is it based on the number of people in the state? Why can't people just vote directly and not have to worry about how many electoral votes they can get? For example, Florida has 29, Texas has 38, and california has 55. They are all big numbers and they can easily make a huge impact on who becomes president. The less populated states on the other hand, don't really do much justice. Maine has 4, Hawaii has 4, and Alaska has 3. It seems really unfair to those states because they have a small chance of actually making any sort of dent in the numbers. Alaska's numbers compared to California's numbers is just really unfair. If people were able to vote directly, then it would be fair game for the states with fewer electoral votes.

In the end, people know the Electoral College is an unfair way of voting. People are lied to about being able to vote because it is not direct because it is the Electoral College decides anyway. The state numbers are really unfair, it is a nondemocratic way of voting, and people think it is way out of date. If the Electoral College were to trade spots with the voters who aren't in it, I'm sure they'd say that it is really unfair. People don't really get to vote, if anything, there should be direct voting like most people believe there is. It would be more fair for states like Alaska and all the other states with really small numbers. I'm sure it is easy to keep track of the numbers with electoral votes, but yet like I said, it is really unfair for the smaller populated states.",0,0.008113933,0,True
827C8F96A128,"When assigning mandatory summer projects for students, they should be student-designed rather than teacher-designed. The first reason is because the students can make it whatever they want and however they want to do it. The second reason is it is more fun and creative for the students if they do their own designed project. Lastly, it is a lot easier for the students to complete the project if they design it themselves.

However, some may argue that these summer projects should be teacher-designed. Assigning projects that are teacher-designed will probably make it easier on some students because then they do not have to think about what their project could be about. They can just follow the teacher's instructions and the rubric, if given one, and then complete the project based off the teacher's design for it. Nevertheless, there are other viewpoints to consider.

The first reason for having a student-designed project would be that the students can make it whatever they want. They can think of their own ideas and how they want to do their project. If a student has an interesting and unique idea for the project that he knows will benefit him more than whatever a teacher could have designed, then he should be able to carry out that idea for his project. Not only would he/she be doing a project they can actually learn from, but it will be interesting for them to do.

Another reason for a student-designed project would be that it is more fun for the students. You are already assigning them a mandatory summer project that they have to do and take away from their summer break, the least you could do is let the students decide how they want to design their projects. Sure you can give them a general idea of what the project has to look like and an overall basis of what it should include and be about, but I believe the main point of the project and how they create it should be up to the students.

Lastly, a student-designed project will overall be easier then what a teacher would design. The students are just trying to relax and enjoy their summer and will probably just not do the project at all if a teacher designs it to be hard or uninteresting to the students. If the students decide what and how they want to do the project, they are more likely to complete the task because they chose something that is interesting to them which will not only benefit them, but also fulfill the school and teacher's requirements to complete a summer project.

In conclusion, if schools require that students have to complete a summer project, the least they could do is leave it up to them to decide how the project is designed. It would not only benefit them more if they designed it, but also make it more interesting for them so they actually want to complete it. I can personally guarantee that the majority of students either do not finish any summer assignments they are given or just don't bother to do them whatsoever. That is because they find it pointless to them and they know it will not benefit them in anyway. That is why teachers should assign student-designed summer projects rather than teacher-designed projects. ",0,0.00741241,0,True

I think that it is a very good idea to change the policy for athletes to have at least a B average in every subject.

By having the policy change into having a B average in every class will help the students to feel the pressure into having good grades. If they have the pressure they will pay attention in class, do homework and , improve the schools as well as the students test scores. Making the students smarter and more confident.

In addition changing the policy will make the student body more responsible in life. It will teach to have responsibility to have their assignments done on time. Turn in homework when its due. Thirdly to finish class work in class. All this is very important in school.

Also this will tell they students that everything is important not just the sport or sports that him/or her may play.

DD00E48BC258,"Honestly, I do not agree about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success. The pursuit of success in life is achieving it in many ways.. Therefore, you can push yourself to be successful by putting in effort.. Failure can lead to serious conflict because then you will not be able to succeed. The important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success is not agreeable because you can overcome obstacles, aiming the goal to success, and to achieve the plan to .success.

First reason, is to overcome the obstacles, for that you must have to work hard. Also, it takes practice the better you get to succeed. Do not give up on something you are overcoming in life. One of the biggest problems that people have in life is not overcoming what they are afraid of and from being afraid will not get you to succeed. Most of all to overcome the obstacles. is to try them not to give up on them.

Second reason, putting a great effort can lead to improving. Efficiently the work you do can increase a great impact towards your achievements. In order to achieve a method, working pays off and by earning it. For example, people push themselves to making progress. Others might work hard in different ways to be successful and to aim what they want. Eventually, when making progress towards something, can influence the goal your improving.

Third reason, to plan the success is to try achieving what your aiming for. In other words, enthusiasm can be those people that want to be successful in life. Pursuit also aims for the goal your trying to influence. When planning goals, is the most valuable thing to achieve. There must always be a plan towards the target you aim. Majority of the people, look for something easy they can achieve in their future goal and that is how they succeed.

Finally, the key to being successful in life is by achieving it. To be honest, I do not agree about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of improving. Many people find success by putting in effort and time towards big things. It is not to late to start pushing yourself to be successful and being something in life. Therefore, is it not an important role that failure plays in pursuit of success, and to achieve the plan to succeed",0,0.05494138,0,True

Getting students involved in community service is a great idea! By doing this students will have the opportunity to help people in need, help the environment and feel good about doing things for their city. I think all student should be required to do at least 10 hours of community service each year and in this letter I will convince you of that!

By students performing community service it gives them the opportunity to have fun by helping the environment. For example, if all the students from each grade got together and went somewhere in their community and planted trees, that would be a great learning experience for the students and teaching them about how global warming is effecting our planet would be a great way for the teachers to encourage the children to do more with helping the environment.

Next, by children performing more community service it gives them the chance to help others. For example, students could go on a field trip to a local nursing home or a homeless shelter and sing Christmas carols to the residents around Christmas time. I would have loved to have done something like that in school but it was never required that we do community service so it was not done. Also by doing this, the residents would enjoy it and would talk highly about the school.

Finally, by children performing more community service students might feel good about themselves for helping others and the environment. Who could not feel good about helping others and making a difference? By feeling good about themselves students' self esteem level will increase and they will always remember what they did to help someone else and help the environment.

I hope my reasons and examples have convinced you to require all students here at SCHOOL_NAME to perform community service. I think helping save the environment and helping others are so important for young students to do so that whenever they are older they will also wish to do community service. Please take my request into consideration, the world will thank you!

9EF6AC7590A2,"When someone does not know or is confused about a situation why is it not ok to ask multiple people for advice? When people ask for advice they sometimes ask multiple people instead of one. Asking multiple people for advice can be beneficial in many different ways depending on the situation. Like how Hearing about other peoples experiences and depending on the ending determines what you should or should'nt do, and lets you see stuff from different perspective to see different advantages, gives you more than one choice to choose from.

To begin with, lets you learn from other peolpes mistakes so you wont make make the same mistakes they did. If you ask someone about their experience and it ended badly then it most likely was not a good idea. But thats the good thing about asking multiple people if one had a bad idea you can always ask someone else to see if their advice was better. If they find someone that had a good outcome to their story that may be a good choice to make. But depending on the outcome you want to get ones advice can be more useful than the other.

Furthermore, maybe their situation is different from from the people they are getting advice from. Although hearing stories from different perspectives can teach you different things. Hearing how they felt about it and what they used to their advantage shows that you could use some of the same methods they used. Hearing varietys of stories starting in different places whether it be at work or home shows a different way to do something. Seeing from their perspective and not just their own helps them find advice that will work for them.

If they let one person give them advice it may help but maybe not as much as they wanted. Hearing multiple people can give you many choices on how to do something. They wont only have to do one they could have lots different choices. Studies show that people do better when they have more than one choice so they could do better when facing the problem. By letting them have more than one choice they can think about it and determine which one is the best for them.

In conclusion, people should listen to more than one person when asking for advice. They could learn from others mistakes so that they wont make the same ones. Can teach them different advantages they could use against their problem. and Give them more than one peice of advice they could use for their problem. These are advantages of listening to more than one person when asking for advice.           ",0,0.007812843,0,True
DAFF03EE1185,"Being stuck in school wasting time is one of the biggest tortures a student faces. How can teachers teach when they're talking to faces looking down at florescent screens with Airpods in their ears? The best way to reach them is by using technology, which is more interactive and entertaining for the students; phones aren't the distraction, it's the lack of interest. In order to provide a better education, teachers should adapt to a new method of teaching: virtual classrooms. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes at home because distance learning provides more opportunities to those who are unable to get to school and in order to enhance learning environments, allowing personalized educations that provide better opportunities to all students.

Usually, snow days are a time for excitement and fun for students, but high-schoolers would probably spend too much time worrying about what they are missing in class. Ever since the introduction of Google Classroom, students have been able to keep better track of their assignments and not fall behind in their educations .

Last year, a huge snowstorm caused my school to be canceled for two weeks, but it wasn't as enjoyable as it sounds. Too much of my time was spent worrying about what assignments are due, what quizzes I have to prepare for, and how I would be able to finish all of my work in time. Luckily, I was able to use Google Classroom in order to see my late work and ask my teachers questions on what I was confused on. Emailing my teacher Generic_Name is very different than being able to have online classes with her, as it allows for more connection and a stronger understanding of the subject. When having a video conference, she can answer my questions in depth when I would otherwise be lost without answers. Not all of the class I take are available in my school, and virtual classrooms allow me to access more opportunities for education. Distance learning allows students to have access to an education if they are prevented from reaching it in physical schools.

Some people believe that a traditional learning environment is the best way to provide an education, because this style allows the best of the best to flourish. In the book

Outliers , one could argue that by having a specific place to learn, it would separate those who had the motivational drive to continue on and those that would settle for less. Those who went above and beyond would have access to more education in order to provide different levels of learning, allowing the smartest to receive the most education while not wasting 'unnecessary' supplies on people who wouldn't put their skills to use. The problem is that motivation is an external influence, and different levels of interest doesn't mean that those students would be less successful or deserve less help. With many new styles and methods of learning, along with more support systems in order to allow students to succeed in their classes, students are able to find a method of teaching that best suits them and allows them to become successful. A major reason that students are uninterested in learning is because of the pressure put on them and the lack of interesting topics to learn. By having virtual classrooms, students would be able to freely explore and develop their own education path that would have previously been inaccessible.

Not everyone has the same opportunities to learn, and distance learning is able to bridge those gaps and allow more people to have access to an education. In the book

Educated , none of the family had a formal education, as none of the children were able to attend a public school and the parents never finished high school. By having a digital classroom, they would have been able to pass the GED or SAT in order to move out of their parent's house and live their own life. The oldest brother had a learning disability, and wasn't able to find any work because of his lack of education. If he was to have an online tutor or teacher, he would have access to more suitable environment to continue to learning while getting the help he needs. Along with providing additional help in school, a virtual learning environment also introduces students to new cultures and people that they would otherwise not have been exposed to, thus enriching their lives. Attending online classes allows students to have access to a better education and introduce them to a world of possibilities.

Giving students the possibility to reach their full potential should be the goal of every teacher. By having students attend online classes, they are able to gain a stronger education that what they were able to previously access. Virtual educations are the path of the future, allowing easier accessibility, diverse learning opportunities, and additional help to all students.",0,0.007318782,0,True

I am very concerned about the new school policy that is students may not participate in sports or other activities if you do not have at least a B average . I don't think that should be a school policy because there are kids that try there best 100% and they don't get B averages but they really want to play sports. I think that it should be that if you are a hard working student and you want to be able to participate in sports or other school activities , you should be able to . and for the kids that don't try there 100% best on their work they should be the students that are not able to participate in the school sports and activities. also the students that are not getting good grades but are trying 100% , they might not feel well they might be sad and so if they participate in sports or school activities that will bring joy into them and they can have fun instead of constantly thinking about how bad you are doing in school. and you will have the chance to have fun and get exercise. the kids would be able to get exercise and they will be in better shape and will be a healthy person.

Today, The majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basic.

When going to work, School, and so much more. Humans also use cellphone while driving drivers should not drive while texting or talking on the phone. It to dangerous in the United States, automobile crashes due to distracted driving are increasing. The leading cause of distracted driving is cell phones. In 2015, six hundred and sixty thousand drivers in the United States were estimated to use cell phones each day, while driving behind the wheel during daylight hours. Cell phone use while driving has become a leading cause of vehicle crashes over the last two decades.

Drivers who text when behind the wheel, are twenty-three times more likely to have an automobile crash.

Some states have implemented laws in regards to using cell phones while driving, there is more to be done. But there a good system call ""handsfree"" an adjective describing equipment that can be used without the use of hands (for example via voice commands). That's a safe way to call someone without touching or seeing the phone. Overall, It may be said that texting while driving is bad and maybe just put your phone on Do Not disturb mode.

88DD3D58EA57,"Driving a car has its ups and downs to life. It provides transportation, but it can also be very dangerous. Another issue with cars today is the amount of pollution that cars give off. Smog is caused by cars and is not good to the environment and certainly not good for people to be breathing in. Both ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" and ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" discuss the affects cars can have on the evironment. ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" and ""The End of Car Culture"" talk about the decrease of the amount of cars used today. Many communities today are turning into car-free places to clear up the smog and dangers of driving.

Smog in Paris, France and Bogota, Columbia have reached record pollutions and both cities do not want to deal with it any longer. Robert Duffer writes about how the Paris government enforced a new rule which allowed both even and odd numbered license plates to drive on a certain day and would alternate everyday. This was very beneficial, however some people needed transportation but would be fined $31 if their car was used on the wrong day. Being that Paris is one of the most famous capitals of the world, one would expect to see more smog than usual. Andrew Selsky also writes that in Bogota, Columbia, a day without cars was put into place in the 1990's and still continues today. Once a year, buses and taxis are the only transportation allowed in the whole city. If not obeyed, there would be a $25 fine. This day was put into place as an improvement campaign which also benefitted the city. Bike paths and smooth sidewalks were put in and during rush hour has cut the traffic in half. It also opened up restaurants and shopping malls which were widely used by the public. Both Paris and Bogata saw improvements in their environments without having so many cars on the road.

Life without cars can also be beneficial to ones community because few people will be buying gas or diesel fuel for their cars. Elisabeth Rosenthal tells her audience that Vauban, Germany has an upscale community where nearly everyone has given up their cars. Here, people sold their cars just so that they could buy a house in peace without having to hear traffic jams and honking horns all the time. Many say that this environment makes them happier because it is so peaceful. 70% of the community do nott own cars and the ones that do must leave it in a large parking garage outside the developement  that is purchased with the home. In another article, also written by Elisabeth Rosenthal, discusses America and the recent  decrease of the amount of driven by a single person. Research shows that the amount driven in 1995 is about the same as the amount driven in 2013. This is due to environmental protectionists who walk evrywhere they go and due to the dangers of driving. There are fewer young adults driving today as well; in eight years, the amount has decreased 23%. Many are giving up their cars today to make a better, happier living.

There are cities all across the world that are limiting the amount of cars being used. Smog is a very pollutive that many don't even realize. Many say that walking and biking around provides them with a more peaceful lifestyle. Limiting car usage will provide less smog in the air and will save you money from having to buy gas or diesel fuel.    ",0,0.007924442,0,True
BFFDCA7C7E1E,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they can continue learning over their break. should these summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? Well personally I don't think there should even be a project, but for the sake of this essay, let's say I do think there should be. Should summer projects be student, or teacher based? I think it should be student based, but to an extent.

Summer projects should be student-based. But only to a certain extent. While giving students the option to do a project on whatever they want is a good idea, but also a bad one. For example, a student who traveled to a different country could do a project on the cultural differences of the two places. While on the other hand, a student that stays home all summer does one that is too easy and looks like a third grader did it. While I agree that giving the students the freedom to pick what they want is a good thing, it can also be a bad thing. Which is why I also think that the projects should be teacher based.

Why should they be teacher based? Well, when the students are allowed to pick their own topic for a project, they can be either good, or bad. But when a teacher picks the prompt for them, or maybe lets them pick out of a set list of prompts, then the teacher knows what to expect, and how to grade it. But even though the teacher might like it, the students may hate it. Take this SOL essay prompt into example, making teenagers write an essay about summer projects? No student wants to do that, but they grudgingly do it because they know they need to pass this to graduate.

But, while no student likes doing projects during their break from school, it's better to have the students have a prompt that was hand picked by them from a list made by a teacher. Because it's better to know that the prompt for the project was well thought out by someone with a teaching degree, instead of a quick Google search done by a teenager looking for an easy A on a project.",0,0.0073793232,0,True

Also to try and ues it on a classroom of kids? Amazing! To create such technology had to have been super difficult. Although, it didn't seem so impossible for Porf. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nicu Sebe, the creators of the Facial Action Coding System, to create such an amazing computer system!

While reading this artical I thought to myself, ""I wonder what it would be like to try and use this technology to read my peers emotions when I ask them if they are okay?"", when I ask them I usually grt the sholder shrug, a sigh, or they just don't answer. But to use this technology and get an answer to the question I ask almost on a daily basis, would be amazing! I bet the teachers would love it too, because they could tell if the students really felt on a lesson, or if they just don't care enough to pay attention to what the teacher is saying.

Also if we could use this technology say, for example, two students get into a fight and neither one of them will tell how they feel about the situation, we could just use this to read how they feel, then adress the sitiation the way it needs to be. The technology could also be used for things such as theropy, for those who really don't know how to describe their feelings, or just want to be left alone to think. It could also help with seeing how people feel about diffrent situations, and they just don't want to speak up. Or if a student is getting bullied, and they don't want to talk about how they feel about it, read their face.

This new technology could be a great thing for the future. Using it to try and understand how students feel is a good thing. But also I do feel students have a choice, a choice that means if they want to have their face's read or not. If the student doesn't want their face to be read, then so be it. If the student is willing to have their face read, then so be it.

In conclusion to this essay, I find it amazing how Prof. Huang and Prof. Sebe were able to create something as amzaing as this! Jus t being able to read the face of a human is hard for people to do, but now with this new technology, we can do so much! Because a picture, in this case a face, can say a thousand words.

Now that we know life can possibly be sustained there in the future, how do humans get there? Venus's suface and atmosphere is extremely hot and dangerous to humans. NASA has been testing a few ideas such as mechanical technology and simplified computers to help explore Venus. Paragraph seven states, "" some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chambers simulating the chaos of Venus's surface."" .With this tech humans could possibly be on the surface of Venus without having to fear the dangerous conditions. When this technology gets more advanced scientist will be able to explore Venus with ease.

Venus is a very challenging plant to study and travel to. The author gives credible facts to explain how it could benefit humans. With traces of water and animal life humans could possibly live on Venus. Scientist have been making advances in creating better technology to explore the planet so it can be sustainable in the future. With the information and technology Venus might be in our grasp one day.           ",0,0.007961099,0,True

Dr. Huang relies the work of psychologists such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS, Eckman has classified about six basic emotions which are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and even sadness after that he even then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles in which for example, are frontalis pars laterlis muscle (above your eyes) in the raises of are eyebrows when we are surprised; are orbicularis oris (around are mouth) tighten are lips to show anger.

The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to are face, while in the computer it shows it in how much it can do. In the computer imagine know when we are happy or even sad for example, if we smile when a Wed ad appears on are screen, a similar ad might follow. But if we frown, the next ad will be different.

When we are looking in the mirror:

* raise your lips at the corner of your mouth,

* when you squint your eyes slightly, to produce wrinkling at the corner of your eyes,

* when you hold it, rise the outer pars of your cheek up, toward your eyes,

In fact, these are instructionws for a face that looks happy.

In a real smile, the zygomatic major (muscles that begin at yourt cheek bones) lifts the corner of you mouth. (that's out instruction #1.)

F6F18B358031,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

To me community service is important and all students that attend SCHOOL_NAME should be required to participate in community service. Community service is very important. I believe responsibility for serving these hours should begin in sixth grade with a requirement of about ten hours. Then the hours per student should increase as the grade the student is in increases. If students are required to achieve service hours it will do a lot of good for them and for their community.

A positive consequence for the students at SCHOOL_NAME would be preparing them for high school. At most Catholic high schools community service is definitely a big part of a student's education. At SCHOOL_NAME or SCHOOL_NAME, service hours are required in a large quantity. This is one reason why I think community service would help the students of SCHOOL_NAME

Another reason is to teach kids at young a age the great part about helping people. Sure you could just tell them it is good to help somebody but telling them won't put them in a habit of helping. If the students go out and help others on a pretty regular basis then it will become a habit of helping others and they will do something to help more people in their community without having to think twice about it.

Community service would also be a great advantage for SCHOOL_NAME and attract more people to this school. People who see students from SCHOOL_NAME helping in their community will want to send their child here. Most parents would like to send their child to a school with community service to teach him or her morals and discipline. It would be excellent for SCHOOL_NAME to adopt this idea of community service.

In conclusion, I believe community service would do tons of good for the students, SCHOOL_NAME and the whole community. Not only would this go to the student's advantage and would give everyone, including SCHOOL_NAME, an edge. TEACHER_NAME, if you propose and adopt this idea, I guarantee you will not regret it.

df53de90,"From saving money to having less pollution, limiting car usage has its advantages. Many believe that having a car is needed to operate in today's society. While others think it is a last resort when all other transportation opportunities are unavailable. While they both have good points, it is said that less car usage has its benefits.

A good benefit is less pollution. In source one of "" In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosental discusses of a Vauban, a tighted fitted community suburb that is a growing trend in Europe. Despite having to be restricted to using your vehicle, passenger cars are only responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe while the United States experiences 50 percent in some carintensive areas. Then in source two of ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer tells about a ban that France enforced to help clear the air from the world known city of Paris. With cold nights and warm days it caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emission and that was when it was enough for France. Due to such a ban, enough smog cleared from some passengers could drive again.

Another is more community interaction. In source three of "" Carfree day is spinning a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky tells of Bogota, Columbia and its program of spending its citizens to experience a day without a car. Millions Colombians either hiked, biked, skated or took the bus to work. Instead of one single person being stuck in their car through traffic, they had many people placed in one bus. Due to such a wonderful opportunity many people felt less stressed. More people were seen together then by themselves that even parks and sports centers were blooming throughout the city.

Another benefit would be less traffic. In source four of "" The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal discover in recent studies of new generations buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses. As people ride the busses more, carpool with friends or even just mobility connected with friends instead of driving less traffic has occurred. Since this has been going on pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into connectednetwork to save time and converse resources.

38E5CA5C3B95,"Dear Principle,

The United States youths' job is to go to school and get educated for the future. Although you can hardly call that a job, it would be better to call it a privilege a privilege. In this country the majority of citizen children do not have to go to working job like adults, their sole job do their work from their job at school. All the children have to do is learn what the teacher says and do the assignments the teacher says. Easy as pie. So when kids are barely passing on a C average there is not an excuse.

They are not doing their job. If they can't do what they are supposed to at the level that is expected, why should they take on more responsibility. It simply does not make sense. If your barely sliding by every day, how much use will you be on the sports field if your barely sliding by on there as well. Personally i get straight A' s and it will be a rare site to see me with a B grade at all. My advice to those who do get C average and make some idiotic excuse is do your work. That is all i simply do. Do your work then, anything else that needs tending comes second. Fun which is not needed is the last and least of your priorities. No if' s, and' s, or but' s, about it as my mother would say. If you get a grade C average you easily have room for improvement so its best that you do improve. It won't be to hard, and you'll benefit from improving your grades. If you do good in school you'll do good on the sports field because you have your priorities straight and you aren't constantly on the border line between flunking your grade or passing.

Driveless cars could not only cause alot confusion and contraversy between manufacters and customers, but can also affect the roads, rules, and laws of the road.

If driveless cars were to be put into action these cars would have to be incredibly smart and be able to function and respond to thier suroundings such as other cars and .pedestrians.

aa0b24ef,"Dear Florida Senator, There has been much controversy over whether or not we should keep the Electoral College or have it removed and vote on the president based on popular vote. I believe the best decision is to change to an election by popular vote for the President of the United States. If the system would change, people would feel like their votes actually matter more then they do now. They wouldn't have to worry about the electors flipping sides. Some people though, do say that the way the election is now is completely fair in the case of votes are based on population.

To begin with, if the Electoral College was to be taken out of use, more people would feel like their vote matters. Although you may think you are voting for your choice of president, you are not. As of now, when you cast your vote, you are actually just voting for your candidate's electors, as said in ""What Is the Electoral College"". In the 2000 campaign, voters in seventeen states didn't have a chance to see the candidates at all. Those candidates went mainly to the ""swing"" states, or states that were not certain on who they would be voting for. The states unvisited, such as Rhode Island and South Carolina, were passed over because the candidates knew they would or wouldn't have their vote no matter what. The ones who questioned their vote did not have the chance to see either candidate in their state. In, ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"", the rodney and Obama election is mentioned. It brings up the fact that rodney knew that throughout the South, he was going to get their vote. He realized that there was no need to go there because he didn't need anymore popularity in the South because he had already gained their electoral votes. Those who opposed rodney in the southern states felt that their votes would not matter because majority already knew they were voting for rodney. If the system were to change, which I believe it should, more people would feel their votes mattered no matter what state they were in.

In addition to feeling like your vote matters, people never know if the electors would flip their desicions. The slate of electors is not picked by the people. It is said in, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid jdefenses of the system are wrong"", that sometimes the state conventions, the party's central committee, or the presidential candidates themselves choose who will be their electors. That being said, you don't know whether or not the electors will follow your choice of president or not. For example, in 1960, some electors refused to vote for their party's candidate and they chose whomever they wanted. If we were to switch the way things are now, that would not happen. A poll taken in 2000 called the Gallup poll, showed that over 60% of voters prefered a direct election rather then the kind we have now. This took place when Al Gore recieved the popular vote, but lost the electoral votes. You can see that the current system has its flaws.

Many people say that it is fair for all states because of their amount of electoral votes. For example, in ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"", Florida, which has a much larger population than Wyoming, recieved 29 electoral votes for Obama while Wyoming only had 3 electoral votes. This, at the same time though, makes candidates want to only go to the larger states to try to get their votes. The smaller states once again feel left out and unappreciated.

In conclusion, I strongly feel that we need to change to an election by popular vote. Above all, it is more fair to the people. Citizens would feel that their votes matter more than they do now. People wouldn't have to be worried about if the electors would flip on what they had voted for. Although some say its is absolutely fair throughout all the states, there are still the set backs that come along with keeping an Electoral College. I agree with former presidents, Nixon and Carter, that we need to abolish the Electoral College. All of these reasons show you the problems there are with the current system of electing our President and I know you will agree.",0,0.0076022674,0,True
50BC2C5D78A9,"The principal has decided that all students must do an extracurricular activity. Extracurricular activities can be fun or can just give you something to do. However, I do not agree with this. The principal might have a good reason for doing this, but students should be able to do whatever classes they want to do and not do whatever they don't want to do, and some extracurricular activities could clog a busy student's life with unnecessary work.

Students should be able to choose whatever they want to do. Some might want to take extracurricular activities, and some might not want to. One of the most important things about work, school, or any type of job is that it doesn't matter what you're doing as long as you're happy doing it. Happiness has a large effect on anyone's life. It is very important that a student is happy with whatever they are doing, because if they do not like what class they are participating in, they might not want to do their work, which could lead to bad grades, which could lead to anxiety or depression. Then, they might not be able to focus on their other classes, and that means more bad grades. There are many other paths that not enjoying your work can go down, too.

Some children's lives could be very busy. Let's say that a child is living in a family that does not have much money, so they need to stay home and babysit their siblings. An extracurricular activity such as a sport can lead to the child not being home until even later that day, which means their parents have to stay home to watch their other children, meaning the parents can not work to make more money. This could lead to very difficult financial issues for the child's family. In fact, this happens too often in real life. This could happen in real life to a student at the school, and they might not even be able to afford school anymore.

The principal should most definitely consider their decision. Extracurricular activity can affect student's lives in many different ways, but some of effects can be not at all beneficial to a student. Unnecessary work can affect emotional, physical, and mental health in more ways than you can imagine. If students want to do an extracurricular activity, they can, and if they don't want to, they shouldn't have to. Not being able to make your own decision can not only affect what you want, but also what you need.",0,0.008088304,0,True

Additionally, students will benefit taking classes online because, they will learn in a peaceful environment, getting online computer experience, and responsibilities of doing the work independently. It makes it easier to stay home rather than walking to the bus stop. Many students are having part time jobs and they are working till late night, in that case they would have enough time to sleep and attend online classes. Student will be able to take their time and finish the required work and assignments. Many students don't feel better at school, and they are filling the classes, so it is the best option for them.

To begin, students will learn in a peaceful and a safe environment, many students prefer homes or some private places to study and solve their problems. Students will focus on the topics they receives. There would be no one to distract you, while you doing the work at home. Students wouldn't have issues with people around them. Many students at school complains about bulling. If you take online classes and work independent you would have best grades and better health . Silent environment makes you work harder towards your target. It makes it easier to find the information quickly.

Lastly, taking classes online makes student work independently, learn quickly, and pay attention strongly. It's very important that student should be able to work by their own and learn methods of a work. Online classes requires more work independent. If you work independently you will learn it faster than others. Always work independent! Would you learn it easier to work independently? I would say yes, it's like preparing your self to a quiz or a test. In that case you are working alone and your results will be higher the the average.

AF642CA41345,"""Try to work harder in life, that will help you with your problems. Being lazier in life is the key to finding happiness, without it we cannot live on. Life is like an ocean, it comes back to get you time and time again."" These are things called advice, it is something that one gives to another to help them with problems they have. The problem with having advice is, due to the overwhelming population on this planet, people tend to try and focus on one piece of advice and not expand their horizon. As a result, they tend to not have a good life filled with joy but a bitter life that leads them nowhere. That is the reason why having different types of advice will help someone out a lot more than just having one piece of advice. There are three reasons why more advice is better: one person cannot have all the advice in the world, having all that advice will help people form their own opinions, and successful people around the world only became successful through the advice of more than one person.

Firstly, there is not a single person in the world who has all the knowledge of life. They cannot know every single culture, every single belief, every single way to cope with life, every single shortcut, and every single language in the world. In addition, that is not the end of the list there are many more things that make up the knowledge of life, which one person cannot have fully. When people seek for advice, they are looking for a solution to a problem, whether it be life or how to answer a question. In order to find the answer to whatever the problem is, there needs to be more than one person involved to help so that they can offer their opinion of the situation based on their experience in the problem. Finally, throughout all of history there is not a single battle won by just one person. It takes a whole army to win a battle, just like how it takes a lot of advice to form one good choice. Also, kings in the old ages had more than one adviser, so that they can get advice from many people who have more experience in life than they do. Therefore, having different types of advice from different people is much better than having advice from one person who does not know everything.

When one person is asked for advice, the advice is followed and the receiver does everything they can with the advice given. When multiple people are asked for advice, the receiver bases off their own choice or opinion from the advice given to them by other people. In this world, everyone is different because of their experience in life, their appearance, their mindset, etc. There is no way advice from one person will help with the problem of a different person, which results in bad advice. Being able to make your own opinion about something based off of other people's opinions is what life is about. The only reason why people are able to give their own advice was by forming their own opinions from people before them. Throughout life, people will face hardships and challenges different from everyone else, which is another reason why everybody is different. Because of that, it is important that everyone forms their own opinion and not just one given to them by only one person. So, that's why people who ask more than one person are able to succeed in life, whereas people who do the opposite get the opposite in life.

Lastly, successful people around the world were only able to get where they are now because of the people surrounding them and the advice they got. Important people in the world such as Bill Gates, got all types of advice; whether it be good, bad, misleading, or questioning advice they still were able to become successful. That is all due to the fact that they were able to pick out the ones that apply to them and form their own opinions. Elon Musk, the founder of the company Tesla, was not able to make a Tesla when he was just a teenager. He had to ask for advice from people on how to make a name for himself, he had to learn everything about a car and the way it works, he had to ask for advice about what to do with all the money he got when he became successful. As a result, he was able to achieve his dream through the advice of others, and not just one person. Barack Obama, a former president, did not now anything about politics when he was a toddler. So, how did he become the first African American president in all of U.S. history? It was because of all the advice he got from everyone on where to go to study politics, how to become a successful politician, how to make a campaign for presidency, etc. Only then was he able to form his own opinion through the advice of others and decide where to study politics and how to become the president. In the end, the only way a person can become successful is by forming their own opinions through the advice of not one person, but many.

""People in this world are only able to live because of the people surrounding them. Trying to forget your past is the best thing you can do. Changing the past will not help your future."" Because of all this advice, it is hard to find the right one that will help someone. So, what most people do is just ask one person for advice and stick to that when solving their problem. That is exactly what leads to bad advice, because there is not one person in the world who has all the knowledge. For good advice, people need multiple types of advice from different people who have different experiences. Using all that advice, they will be able to form their own opinions and use that for whatever their problem might be. Also, successful people around the world are not able to become who they are based off of just hard work. They had to ask for advice from people with more experience about how to achieve their goals, how to fix an ongoing problem in the world, etc. By doing so, they themselves became successful. So next time there is a problem, remember that having multiple types of advice is better. ",0,0.010180728,0,True
2D0602A6D95E,"While the idea of having a fully-autonomous is very real, scientists are still very far from it. Research is being conducted every day to improve the efficeincy and safefty of these new semi-autonomous vehicles. In my opinion, driverless cars are inevitable and I would not doubt that I will end up seeing one in my lifetime. But as of right now, cars can't do as much as scientists are hoping for in the future. With that being said, I will there will be a more positive outcome of driverless cars than negative.

Many skeptics say dirverless cars will never be possible. But, what they don't realize is that we are closer than we ever have been before regardless of how much research is still necessary to succesfully make a fully autonomous car. Google's concept car has been able to drive over half a million miles without a crash. Their car still requires a driver, but it is only for more advanced tasks such as traffic issues or roadwork. Other companies have also attempted to create a driverless concept car and the concepts have showed potential. They are far from driverless but they are going in the right direction. BMW announced that their car could handle driving speeds of up 25 mph but still require the focus of a human being behind the wheel.

While I am very supportive of driverless cars, I think there will always be flaws, no matter the size. I think there will always be malfunctions but that does not mean that those can be fixed either. The research that has been put into these vehicles have been very strenuous and have proven that there will never not be flaws in creating an autonomous car. They still may crash but the probability of a fatal crash in a driverless is much lower than the probability of a fatal crash due to human error. Humans get distracted thus creating more chances for an accident to occur. With driverless cars, there is no chance of human error or the car getting distracted because driving is what it was built for.

There are not many current laws or regulations on autonomous cars, so even if Google or BMW were to finish research and create a flawless and driverless car, they wouldn't be able to manufacture them on a commercial level. This is because there wouldn't be any laws covering liability in the case of an accident, if an accident were to somehow occur. It is undetermined who would be at fault for the accident according to the state. I think the company should be more at fault, considering they are advertising these cars as ""driverless"".

With my opinion on driverless cars being said, I still think they are a good idea and will benefit society in the long run and keep more people safe. There are bumps in the road regarding laws and the time it will take to get to where big name companies want to be. But, if we are all patient and let scientists conduct quality research, I see a bright future for fully autonomous cars.",0,0.0075055147,0,True
172A3013AF1B,"Have you ever been in a loud, tedious, and obnoxious environment? Have you ever lacked proper individual assistance? If so, you qualify to relate to thousands of students who attend public schools. It is no secret that public schools are not meant for everyone. Some students learn and develop under private school systems, meanwhile others learn and mature better through homeschooling. Nevertheless, every student is different, and each student requires proper individual care, so he or she can reach their full potential. If all schools provide online learning, there could possibly be a massive raise in most students grades, which could not only benefit the students but the schools as well. I believe students will tremendously benefit from the opportunity of online courses, as revealed through, the extensive individual assistance, opportunity for less distractions, and development of self growth and individualism.

First, many students are constantly frustrated about the lack of help they receive. Students fall behind in lessons and classes, because they are not sought after and given proper help. This frustrates many students and is revealed through their grades and assessment scores. A simple and easy solution to all this would be home school. Students can learn all the material thought in class, but in a manner where assistance is provided when needed. This allows students to go at their own pace, and ask for help at any time. Lavar Ball, a well known celebrity, enrolled his youngest son into a home schooling program. Lavar believes the transition was very simple and beneficial for his son. His son is now a professional basketball player, so this proves that home schooling can be a very open and helpful resource for students.

Next, as we know, many students have a difficult time focusing in certain environments. Many classrooms are loud and obnoxious which takes away from certain students abilities to learn. Students with ADHD, and other minor illnesses need controlled situations that allows them to cancel outside noise and simply learn. However, classroom settings do not promote or support that need, and instead promote group work and class engagement. As you can see, this is harmful to the learning of many students which then leads to a drop in grades and causes specific students to loose motivation in their classwork. When taking classes online, students are in a much calmer and reliable situation, which allows them to showcase their true abilities. Once again, I believe the simple solution would be allowing students to take online courses from home, so they can be free of distractions, get individual help, and mature on their own.

Finally, I believe students develop self growth and individualism through online courses from home. When taking classes online, students are essentially working at their own pace, as oppose to, a specific schedule set by somebody else. This then leads to students learning how to manage time and working on the clock. This is a very important skill that is required in the real world, so those who inherit home schooling will get a head start. Next, students can get proper sleep, and schedule there classes at later start times. Some High Schools begin at 7:15 AM, which does not give students proper sleep. The lack of sleep then plays an important role in the lack of focus and attention students provide in class. When taking online courses, students are able to start their classes at later times, and get the proper sleep necessary. This not only allows students to thrive in the classroom, but also plays a huge role in building a healthy lifestyle. Online courses also provide students with a great sense of individualism. Students grow and learn much more about themselves when given the opportunity to work alone and control their own education.

In Conclusion, I believe students can only benefit from the idea of being home schooled, as shown through, the extensive support, efficient learning environment, and fantastic opportunity for self growth. Students are sometimes scared or hesitant to seek the help needed, so online courses and home schooling may be the perfect solutions. The great aspect of online courses is that they are optional, revealing that it can help students in positive ways. Some of the most successful individuals in the world have dropped out of public schools, and embarked on a life of their own. Online courses are an amazing resource for students, and should be taken advantage of! ",0,0.007921301,0,True
67E711AF87A2,"Are you done trying to reach your goal in life? Author Ralph Waldo Emerson is right. If you have accomplished somthing in life but you are not where you want to be then go for more. Keep trying to go beyond from what you have already masterd. It puts your self out their, and lets people know you want more then what you already have. You will defenetly grow if you keep trying. In the process of trying to master things in life it will be important for professionalism,money,and being successful.

Having professionalism in you takes a lot of work and time. For example, Cristiano Ronaldo is a profesional sorccer player, he was once a starter in soccer. Of coures it took time and hard work and lots of practice to get to where hes at.

Another example when i stared playing soccer i was 4 and it was really hard, it was hard to kick a ball or to keep up with the ball, but i went to the feild with my freinds every day and i wanted to be really good so i did not give up. I nocticed my self growing a lot and now i play for a really good soccer team and planning on going to a good soccer collage. However Jobs is something that takes time and hard work. If you work hard at a job and show people that you are good at it, it can get you a better jobs in the future.

Money dose not come to you for free you must do something for it for example, when i was 12 years old i was to young to get a job so i would go next door and ask if i can mow thier lawn or if they had any jods for me.

When you are trying to reach a goal in life and you are growing big time more money gets involved, which is a really good thing. If your boss sees you doing really good at your job your boss can give you a raise or make you be assistant manager because they notice that you are growing and that you want to master more. The more you grow the more better you'll get.

When you made it to where you want to be, you were seccessfull. you tried your hardest and did as much as you can to get to the top. To be seccessfull you need to study a lot try to listen and watch a lot. when you are growing you make mistakes which is fine it happends to a lot of people. You will learn from your mistakes and lessions. For example when i was 5 years old and i was at my soccer game i accidently scorded on my own team and it never ended up happening again cause i learned from my mistakes. Some may say if you don't go beyond from what you have accomplished, you will still grow. They are wrong because the more further you go to accomplish things will make you grow more and it wil help you reach more goals in anything.

Always try to do more then what you have already done. Dont let anyone stop you. You will not grow if you don't go beyond from where you are at. It's good to do anything it takes to master something in life. There are lots of ansers and help everywhere to grow.",0,0.008498436,0,True
9C7CDFEB9F61,"Distracted Driving

Today, many people are distracted by their phones no matter what they are doing, from walking to driving. Being on your phone and driving is one of the most leading causes of accidents. I believe that distracted driving can cause harrowing accidents that can lead to death, it affects teenagers the most, and there are ways that distracted driving can be prevented. The phone can wait!

""Nine people are killed and more than 1,000 injured in crashes involving a distracted driver in the United States each year,"" stated by the Mila Araujo in her writing ""Dangers of distracted driving: Definition, Stats, and Risks for Teens."" Distracted driving isn't just being on your phone, but also eating while driving, playing around, or looking at other things instead of the road. Basically, distracted driving is when your doing everything else but focusing on the road while driving. ""9 percent of fatal crashes and 15 percent of injury crashes due to distracted driving, and an 8 percent increase in all distracted driving fatalities since 2016,"" according to the NHTSA. As you can see distracted driving is extremely dangerous.

Distracted driving affects teenagers more than anyone else. Studies show that more than half of teenagers involved in an accident admitted to it being because of distracted driving. That is to say, ""Teenagers have the highest rate of crashes of any age group in the United States,"" stated by Mila Araujo. Teenagers these days are so attached to their phones to where it's apart of their daily lives. They feel the need to respond to a text or look on social media constantly to where it becomes a habit, and when they get behind the wheel they automatically look on their phones when a simple buzz goes off. Teenagers who are driving risks their lives every time they pick up their phone behind the wheel.

However, in Georgia they passed a hands free law July 1, 2018 which states that any driver driving a motor vehicle are prohibited from holding, watching, recording, writing, texting, etc. In my opinion, I feel as if every state in the United States should pass this law as it would reduce the amount of fatal accidents. There are many ways to prevent distracted driving at any age. One way is to put your phone on ""Do Not Disturb"" until you have reached your destination. If you are using your GPS for finding a location type in the desired location before you start operating the vehicle and review the directions. To prevent yourself from touching your phone use a phone holder for your car. These may save your life from any fatal accidents while behind the wheel.

In conclusion, many people are distracted while driving which is risking their lives. While you're behind the wheel your first priority should be focusing on the road. Everytime you pick up your phone or doing something that is preventing you from focusing on the road is a risk of you losing your life. The text, social media, email, phone call, etc. can wait!

The reason why we need them is because we are bored when we go to other class. You want have no more fights at school. The kids will be more quite. Everybody want say that no one stole there stuff they will have there own. We will learn more into school kids will start coming to school everyday. There will be no more drop out. You want have to tell the kids to be quite or don't do this. You will be resting your nerves.

The other reason why you should let us bring our phone to school what if there's a emergency and we cant get to the phone. What if there something important is going on with family and they get hurt there self because they was not there for there family. What if we are sick and the teacher want let us out of the classroom and we are hurting real bad then what that lead to mess and i know that you don't want that on your hand.

In the article, "" Paris Bans Driving Due To Smog"", the author, Robert Duffer, talks about France banned driving in order to clean the polluted air. According to the text, "" Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals"". Here it is evident that Paris has major pollution problems. Most of the vehicles in Paris have diesel fuel rather than gasoline, in which they favor due to a tax policy. ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party"". This clearly shows us that the ban on driving in Paris had an advantage in keeping a clean air.

Not only will limiting car usage will maintain an polluted air for us to breathe, but it will decrease traffic jams. In the article, ""CarFree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"", by Andrew Selsky, a program is to ""promote alternative transportation"". Selsky writes, ""Rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic"". This tells the reader that this has positive impact on the city.

Limiting car usage could save time, improve safety, and conserve resources. According to the article, ""The End Of Car Culture"", the author mentions how her children live in places in which driving a car would be useful, however its not their priority because they ""organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or carpool with friends"". Although they could have gotten their own license to drive, it would have been a waste of money and time when there is always an available and less cost transportation.

D9B3809280F9,"Why It Should be Required for Students to Partake in an Extracurricular Activity

Should students have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity?

Yes, they should.

Doing activities that aren't required have many benefits. Just some of those benefits are good for the brain, represent your school in different ways than just your grades, and get to know some teachers better than you already did.

It's also just fun.

Many studies have shown that sports or other activities can help the brain or mind in many ways.

It can help by distracting it from stress.

Another way it could help is by developing parts of the brain or educating it in a different way than ""normal"".

For example, if the extracurricular activity you participated in was playing an instrument, that has been proven to educate the brain in different places and that person could be very intelligent.

Next, you can represent your school in other ways then just your grades.

For example, if your sports team wins a championship game you and your other teammates could be in the newspaper or on television wearing the schools jerseys.

If you get clothes with the activity you participate in and schools name on it, that is another way to represent.

When people see your team or group they might tell people how good you were.

When schools are represented in a good way you may get rewarded for it.

Lastly, you could get to know teachers better.

Most of the coaches are also teachers.

When students are in class teachers teach you about a certain subject, but when your at a sports practice or instrumental rehearsal you get to know them in a different way.

You both have something you are excited about doing in common.

Students dont necessarily ""love"" to learn, so they aren't as energetic during school as they would be during something they enjoy.

In conclusion, yes it's a great thing to participate in extracurricular activities.

It develops young people's brains, shows what your school is all about, and get closer with some teachers.

There are many, many more reasons but these are most relevant.

When deciding if it should be required or not please consider these important reasons.",0,0.01203086,0,True

Well,I think students can be benefit this program,if they can work at home by the way of online or video conferencing,because students have more opotuniry to study like have more time to work,they don't need to walk or take a bus to come school,can be more effect to students,students can feel better when they try to stury because in his home there is not people talking a lot abuot things,but people talking not about the class.

Also student can choose the time to they can star the classes,because some students have to work in a job,so when is cold outside and students they don't like to come school,they can wort at home by the way of online or video conferencing,students can be more responseble or maybe not is depent what class of student are you,but the things is there is a lot reasons of benefit for stundents can have that classes.

B7B88E6FF395,"WaBam! That was the sound of her slamming the door behind her as she ran to go ask more people for advice on what to do with the drama at school. When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. They start off by asking themselves what they should do. If they cannot come to a reasonable decision on their own, they go ask more people. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because he or she does not have to over think, it allows him or her to rule out the bad choices, and it allows him or her to be the least stressed possible.

The first reason that seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is that he or she does not have to over think. Usually when someone gets multiple opinions, he or she is going to hear the same one more than once. If he or she hears the same opinion over and over again, then he or she will more than likely go with that choice. Therefore, he or she will not have to think about the choice as much. When I ask multiple people for advice, I go with the opinion that the majority of people are saying, so I do not have to think about it as much. Getting multiple opinions on something gives your brain a break because you do not have to over think.

The second reason that seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is that it allows he or she to be able to rule out the bad choices. When someone receives advice from multiple people, he or she will probably hear the same opinion twice. Usually if someone hears the same opinion twice, then it is more than likely a good choice. If he or she does not hear any of the opinions that he or she had thought of, then the opinions are probably not going to be good choices. When I am receiving advice, it always relieves my stress when I can rule out a bunch of choices. Receiving multiple opinions can save you time, because it helps rule out the bad choices.

The final reason that seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is that he or she is not stressed. When it comes to someone having to make a choice, he or she needs to be stress free. Since seeking multiple opinions does not make someone have to over think, and it allows he or she to rule out bad answers, then he or she should already be stress free. When I am trying to make a decision, I have to be stress free. If I am even an ounce stressed out, then I cannot make a decision. Seeking multiple opinions is a great thing because it does not make you stressed out about the entire situation.

Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because it gives his or her brain a beak, it saves him or her time, and it also does not make him or her stressed. If anyone wants advice, he or she should seek multiple opinions. Receiving multiple opinions will most definitely help someone make a better choice. With all of this information, it is obvious that seeking multiple opinions for advice is the way to go.                 ",0,0.007727524,0,True
EDACE717C302,"In the age of computers and instantaneous communication, society has an incredible amount knowledge available to them. That said, instead of learning with just pen and paper, why can we not also incorporate online learning into our school systems? I believe that students would benefit significantly from being able to attend classes from home because it better accommodates students, helps supplement learning for home schooled students, as well as giving students the option to take more of their desired classes online.

Online learning accommodates students with disabilities as well as students with injuries that may prevent them from easily leaving their homes. It is unfair that our education system would require that they come to school when they can learn the same, or potentially more information from home. Recently, it has become clear that online learning is feasible for an entire school. Take for example, schools in Italy or South Korea. These countries have temporarily closed their schools until April in order to better combat the novel corona virus, COVID-19. That said, the schools are still holding lessons online where attendance is taken and students are given the same education by the same teachers, only through a computer screen. If it is feasible for other nations to accommodate for their students during a health epidemic then surely we can also implement a similar program for our students during times of peace. Furthermore, we can not, both morally and legally, allow for our disabled students to receive a sub par education than their peers. That is a disservice not only to them but the moral foundation and integrity of the community as a whole. Similarly, students with mental illnesses like depression or anxiety are more likely to be productive and learn in an online setting than they are in the classroom. Offering this alternative option to these students will undoubtedly benefit in them being more productive as well as allowing more time for these individuals to seek professional help or therapy then they would normally be able to, potentially decreasing the amount of teenagers with mental illnesses in the United States and at the same time increasing the graduation rate.

A unique aspect of American public education is the fact that a large number of families choose the home school their children rather than send them to a public or private school. Of course, the success and effectiveness varies drastically from household to household but most generally follow a simple, bare bones public school curriculum with little or no instruction from a professionally licensed teacher. If online learning or video conferencing was made available to home schooled students and be used as a supplement to a child's learning, then it will benefit the student's education. Also, many school districts already offer online classes that are supervised by school staff that focus mostly on students learning the course material at their own pace. Take Generic_School's VISION program for example. VISION offers LCPS as well as non-LCPS students many different courses from English and math, to economics and personal finance. If home schooled students could join some of these courses, there will definitely be many benefits for both parties, not least of which is producing students who will advance our country and the world.

Continuing off of the description of Generic_Schools' VISION program, many students in this area feel that they can do a lot more with their education and choose to take classes online in addition to the classes they already take at school. Instead of being overwhelmed in the school building with all of these extra classes, students find it much more convenient and easier to take certain classes from home and at their own pace. Personally, I currently take economics and personal finance online using VISION in order to meet a graduation requirement for my county and find that I am having a much easier time learning the material than other students do in school. Another benefit of online classes is that they are essential for students who wish to take advantage of the fact that all of the courses at public schools are free. Many students take classes pertaining to IT and computer science online in order to gain a complex understanding of these fields and go on to major in these related fields. On the other hand, critics of online learning may say that there are public academies for students who wish to specialize in STEM careers or pursue the humanities and that it is better for students to learn in a formal classroom setting rather than from at home. These arguments do not factor in students who are not competitive enough to apply for academies, cannot afford to, or simply do not wish to attend these academies. It should not be an expectation for students who simply wish to pursue their interests to enter an extremely competitive and difficult environment for the same education that they could receive through less traumatic means. Although institutions like Generic_School of Science and Technology boost a student's resume, they are wholly unnecessary for students who just want to take a couple extra classes and maybe receive some extra credits.

Although formal classroom education has been -and still remains- the standard of public education, as our society moves more and more towards complete digitization of daily life, our system of education should also keep pace and be made to offer distance learning as an option for all students for better students' accommodation, education, and choice in their education. Since this education will last our students a lifetime, we should never falter in giving them the quality education that they are entitled to in the Constitution of this great nation.",0,0.0072571896,0,True
90c014d0,"The articles explain that the limited use of cars or automobiles is to our advantage. Two reasons that support this theory is that one you won't have to stress about buying a car and making sure everyone has one, and second you will help to protect the environment from the harmful gases of automobiles.

The limitation on cars may have its advantages because, among the billions of people on this earth many of them own cars. Many vehicles give off harmful pollution gases to the environment and can cause many endangering problems to people as well. Evidence from source 2: ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" can support the following... ""After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" This evidence supports the fact that there was enough smog in the air that led to the prohibition of cars for a limited time. This is to the people's advantage because they were now able to breathe fresh air instead of smog. Another piece of evidence also comes from source 2: ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying smog...The smog rivaled with Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world."" This evidence shows that smog causes pollution which is harmful in many ways. It also shows just how much of a difference just five days of limitation on vehicles can help reduce pollution. So the sooner people can see what banning cars can do to their health and wellbeing then maybe they will see what the love and cherish so much, can actually be hurting them.

Car limitations may be the best thing yet for America and other places in the world. By banning cars we could reduce a lot of stress and the worry about the payments and supplying the vehicle with gas. Evidence that can support this comes from source 4: "" The End of Car Culture"" ""the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995....recession, because cash strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway."" This explains that many Americans cannot even afford cars. So they go about their days just fine taking public transportation or receiving rides from friends. So by banning cars we could actually reduce the stress of not having a car or making the payments on them... plus we would have better health. Out of the estimated 7 billion people on this earth, it is not guranteed that all of them around the ages of 15 and above are equipped with a a vehicel of their own. Evidence from Source 4: ""The End of Car Culture"" can support the following "" What most intrigues me is the rates of car ownership per househols and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,"" Thi just goes to show you that not only are cars bad for the enviornment and people's health but, they are bad financially for people to maintain and keep up. The automobile is what changed America back in the day. But it is causing some damae to us now.

92D79549D7F3,"Dear Principal,

I feel we should have the first policy. I think it is a good compromise.

The teachers and the students will both get what they want. Phones can be beneficial to the school system. Students will have to know that this is a privilege and can easily be taken away.

During free time if they have nothing to do they would be able to communicate silently with their friends. They could even get help on homework by texting someone from a different room. Some phones even have internet which could be helpful for research reports. The phones will keep the students occupied when they have nothing else to do in study halls or free periods. This will keep the classroom silent for people who really need to concentrate on their work. Talking to friends will help relieve some stress during the day and since they can't talk to all their friends because of different schedules this phone policy will help them to do that.

Teachers will also benefit from this policy because the students will hopefully follow the rules so they are able to text at their free times. Some kids will be less talkative if they were able to tell someone what they needed to tell them before the class. Also if the teachers have the students numbers they could remind them to study and do their homework.

Phones are becoming a big part of the world. Especially in the U.S. Some students will want to break the no phone rule simply because there is a rule. My grandpa always says if there are no rules you can't break any rules. As long as students realize there will be consequences and that this phone policy can easily be taken away then everything should go well.

It could take a little time to get use to so you could try this policy for a month and see how it goes. If it doesn't go well then try it again in another few months. After a while it should catch on. I feel that this will benefit the school tremendously. Please take this in consideration.            ",0,0.006960538,0,True

634DEE9B6FA1,"My claim is going to be on the negative aspect on driverless cars. The one of the reasons that I am going to use is road problems. Also the next problem that I am going to be talking about is a pass for the drivers crime on a crash. The next thing I am going to talk about is the finacial rate. These are the most troubling thing that are running around in my mind.

The first of the many problems is the road problems that can hurt any one on the road. If there is a sewer problem in the middle of the street that the city workers are working on the driverless cars won't have a way to detect the workers. Yes they might install a camera or a sensor to indicate that and alert the driver, but it can alert him to late and the result on that is there is already a crash. Also the car can't tell whether their is a red light or a green light it can only go to the direction it was programed to go to. There can be many more problems that anyone else can say that I'm not saying and think to your self's ""why do they need to alert you before the car doesn't know how to drive a certain way"".

The second reason for the negative aspect of the driverless cars is the passes on a crash. I think that if a person is going to court for getting in a crash because of his driverless car. I am not saying that he should get punished for buying that car, but they should understand that that they should be watching the road. And if someone says that the were sleeping while the car was driving they should go to jail for it. Their might be a worst punishment for it, but they should already know the bad side of the driverless car is not a game.

The last reason i am going to talk about is the finacial rate. Well I should call it money problems for everyone, but I wanted to sound smart. The company will have to sell them expensive prices because of the hardware, software, and other technology that is being combined with the car is not cheap. The people that would want to buy or rent it would have to do alot of work just to buy the car. Buy alot of work I mean he has to win the lottery and still work to still make payments on the car.

There is alot more reasons but i leave it up to the different people that are going to write about it. I hope to the people that read this that there is a positive and a negative side to everything. But it is your life but make the right choices and make sure don't make any mistakes. And i wish you the best and the wish you good luck out there in the driverless car world.",0,0.008747117,0,True
2AB4CD937595,"Dear Principal,

I have heard that you are considering two new phone policies. Policy 1 is about letting us, the students, bring our phones to school and being able to use them at lunch and other free times. While Policy 2 is not letting us have our phones at all while at school. As a student myself I have to agree more with Policy 1. Letting us use our phones during lunch and other free times would let us communicate more with each other. During class most of what we think about is probably what we are going to say to our friends the next time we see them. Since we have no time to coordinate where to go for free time with our friends we might miss them. If we could use our phones to text them we could met up. A friend that is sick and missing classes might want to catch up on work so they don't get too far behind. The friend at school could call them at lunch or free time and tell them if anything important is going on. Along with telling them about school work, we wouldn't want them to get too bored, now would we? Our friends are how we get through the day. They are what makes us look at the white board and say ""I can get this. I can learn."" When we are lost their the ones who put us back on track and the ones who show us the way. If you allow us to use our phones outside of the classroom they can do all of these things from across the school and I'm sure that we would do much better inside the classroom. Phones are the way that we keep up our friendships with those that we never see. I have a friend that the only time I see her is if we happen to go to the same place for free time. Once in a while we will run into each other in the hall and say where to meet but only like once a month. All her classes are upstairs while mine are all downstairs and on the other side of the school. Can you guess the way we've staid in contact? Yep, that's right, cell phones! To some it may sound stupid and cheesy but cell phones are what keeps our lives together. Unless you would rather put all friends together in one classroom, I think the best way to go is Policy 1.

3453B0EC32D3,"Cell Phones & Driving

Although cell phones have not been around for a very long time, they have become a key part of our lives.

People use their cell phones for just about everything such as: texting, talking, schedule planning, internet surfing, etc.

Sometimes we can even do two or more of these things at the same time.

Unfortunately, people are also choosing the wrong time to be using their cell phones: while they are driving.

As a society, we have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can't put down our cell phones. Using a handheld cell phone while driving is dangerous to the driver themselves for a couple of good reasons.

One such reason is that.

When driving, sometimes it is difficult to focus on the road which makes it easy to forget that the roads are shared by everyone and not for your exclusive use. Other drivers on the road take notice of drivers on their cell phones whether they want to or not because of the hazards they create. Erratic driving is something that we all get quite worked up about, especially if it makes us late or is otherwise a direct inconvenience to us. Scott Stone, veteran web business strategist and the owner of the consultancy Jimmy, says He came within inches of a bad accident because of a young driver being on the phone and crossing three lanes of traffic at 45 mph. Drivers are also tailgating you because of, again, the inability to maintain a constant speed because they are on the phone. Clark warns of the rusty red Camaro tailgating the minivan full of kids. Drivers who use cell phones while driving are also highly dangerous to pedestrians. A young woman killed a pedestrian on a bicycle while she was texting on her phone. She may not have intended to end that person's life, but she made the poor decision to drive and text which she has to live with for the rest of her life. Any one of us could have been that poor individual on that fateful day. I used to ride my bike everywhere, mostly using the roads in the way that bikes are supposed to. That just proves that point that everybody 60 percent of teens admitted to risky driving. Nearly half of those drivers admitted to text messaging while driving. In April, 2009, in Houston Texas five children lost their lives when the car they were in lost control and slid into a rain swollen ditch. The driver lost control of the vehicle when he went to answer his ringing cell phone. The car went into the ditch and was swept 100 feet down the raging current. The rescue team was unable to reach the car with the trapped passenger. Two adults and one ten year old girl were able to escape, but five children under the age of seven all passed away. A 17 year old girl was driving in Jacksonville Florida. She said that she glanced down at her cell phone"" when she struck a 44 year old man. He was working on side of the road with his tree trimming crew when he was struck by the distracted driver.      ",0,0.0077574234,0,True

To learn English and speak like a normal person like I speak Spanish, speak bout same without of problems. I'm going to take position on myself to spoken in this introduction, things did i most enjoy in high school is having the opportunity to study here in the United State. And also learn a new language I'm so thanks full for all those opportunities.

All of the things did happen on my life was not easy, and also I remember when my cousin speak English like a normal language and he also came from where came from and i remember did i said i want to spoke like you i was so impressed and how he can speak English like a normal person here in the U.S, because in that time I did not any English at all. When was my time to get in high school begin all this things did i was want for a long time. first day I was so nerviest but at the same time exerted because I came in with my mind in what I'm want and what I love was and is learn English and spoke like normal.

Generic_School give the opportunity at the students graduate on three years, except at the normal traditional four, let me tell you why I take three years except at the normal four cause my age I'm almost getting on (21) at the date to graduate for example, if I'm taking the four years of high school when the people have more then 21, they kicking you off the school

I thing was I good idea taking just the three years to can be graduate on time.

In addition all what has to happen to can be graduate is taking all of the classes did I need it to get the credits. making or taking classes on summer school maybe night school to graduate on time is hard process to graduate in three year but helps a lot to the people who work after school or another thing that probably they has to do, to graduate without credits missing. And here I am in my last year of high school I'm a senior I feel good can be say this is my last year here and all this help me for the program what they made for us to graduate in three years that helps me at all.

In conclusion; I enjoy the must time in high school I know was and is a big way to run was not easy but also no difficult when we want just put in your mind what you want and if you want you can this is my lemma don't give up at the last moment we can cause if you want you can nothing is impossible in this life don't lust the time because the time is like gold I know all this no to much relate about the prompt but I'm know did I doing well believe in yourself. one of the things did I'm thinking about what I going to do after school is going directly at collage don't lust the time did I win.

92E1CFD27E95,"Is it a good idea to force students to participate in extracurricular activities? Extracurricular are set in place to allow students to expand on what they want for their future which should be optional. Being forced to do these could discourage students from what they want to be by having it forced upon them. Clubs and participating in yearbooks could help students make friends and build social skills. In my opinion extracurricular activities should be optional, expand more on student ideas and grades while also helping build social skills.

Extracurricular activities should not be mandatory by any means because they are made to be optional. If any student was forced to do any extracurricular activity it could make that topic boring for them. Having mandatory sports for example could make that teams hype lower. Having students that do not want to be on yearbook on yearbook might make it turn not as expected. Extracurricular activities can help build a students understanding of a topic that they are interested in.

These activities could count toward extra credit if needed for lower grades and help them improve. This could help them for later in life with college. Extra activities could make the student want to help other students in what they want to do. Activities like sports could help students make money in the future if they are good at them. Extracurricular activities could help students make friends if they choose to help other students.

Helping other students would be good at building teamwork for things like sports. Helping other students could make students better tutors. When students are better tutors they could possibly teach a younger generation as well. Social skills could help students apply for jobs and make themselves look better for better opportunities. Working with other people could help the student have a better understanding of what other people may be struggling with in a topic.

As explained extracurricular activities are nice thing to have for these reasons and my opinion is that they should be kept but not forced to be done. Activities are meant to be enjoyed not exploited by the higher staff of the school. Pushing students to do something could possibly be bad for their state of mind and personality. In the end do not make them do it but leave them as an option.",0,0.006964254,0,True
8EB73A991757,"Some schools believe in summer projects, the purpose of these projects are to assure that students continue to learn during summer break. Classes should be challenged to design their own project, this will challenge the student to design a complex project that is guaranteed to stay a topic of interest. Students should poses a checklist that details what the project needs. Teachers can provide examples for the class to reference if they become puzzled on a part of their task. Upon completion the teacher would receive an email verifying that the student finished the task.

Say if the project is for history the teacher can choose the time period they want and the student will find a topic. For example the teacher wants the project to be in the 2000's, the student could then choose to write about wars in the Middle-East. Therefore the topic is relevant to what the teacher wants and the student is interested in his or her research. The person working on the task can write about why the war happened, who started the war, and when the war ended. After the student finishes, the work will be emailed to the history teacher and would be graded.

If a teacher dictated the project the student would not have much interest in the work. The student would lose interest and stop working on it or would score low on the work. Loss of interest may result in the student not learning anything over summer. If someone holds interest in a subject they will retain the information they researched, and can possible continue to understand and research that object or subject. Which would result in learning something new over summer break.

Some teachers might say why give the student control on the project? Well if a student controlled their work they would be able to let their imagination flow, allowing them to discover their personality and learn about how they think and work best. The student would most likely choose something they want to learn more about. They can also choose something that appeals to their interests. For someone to learn something they must choose what appeals to them and build knowledge through research. That is why a student should be able to choose their summer project and not be told what to do work on.

Some students are required to do school projects over summer. Schools say it benefits the student and expands their knowledge. Schools should let the students choose and design their project. Student choice would assure that they learn something new over summer break. Teachers should provide examples and checklist to help the student work and continue to learn over the course of summer break.",0,0.0069589135,0,True

B25CE2873D66,"I say we should keep the Electoral collage. The founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress & election of the president by popular vote of qualified citizens. The Electoral Collage consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. Under the 23rd amedment of the constitution, the district of columbia is allocated 3 electors & treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral Collage. But what's wrong w/ the Electoral Collage, under the electoral collage system, voters vote not for a president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. But in defense of the electoral collage: 5 reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the persident.1)

CERTAINTY OF OUTCOME

-A dispute over the outcome of an electoral collage vore is possible-it happend in 2000-but it's less likey than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning canidate's share of the electoral collage invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote.2)

EVERYONE'S PRESIDENT

-The electoral collage requires a presidental canidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region(south,northeast,etc.) Has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the south, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his pularity in states that he knows he will win. This is a desriable result because a canidate w/ only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president.3)

SWING STATES

-The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the canidates-as we saw in [2012's] election-to focus thier campagin efforts on the toss-up states....Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attation to he campagin-to really listen to the competing canidates-knowing that thet are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average (& for futher reason that thwy will have received the most information & attention from the canidates), and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.4)

BIG STATES

-The electoral collage restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-appotionment of the senate decreed in the constituion....The popular vote was very close in florida [in 2012]; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by rhe same margin in wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes. So, other things be equal, a large state gets more attention from presidntial candidates in as campagin than small sate does....5)

AVOID RUN-OFF ELECTIONS

-The electoral collage avoids the problem of elections in which no canidate recives a majority of the votes casts. For example, Nixon in 1968 & Clinton in 1992 bath had only 43% pularity of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the electoral collage (301 & 370 electoral votes,respectively). There is pressure for run-off elections when no canidate wins a majority of the votes casts; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by electoral collage, which invariably produces a clear winner....It can be argued that the electoral collage method of selecting the presindent may turn off potential voters voters for a canidate who has no hope for carrying their state-democrats in texas,for example,or republicans in california. Knowing thier vote will have no effect,they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote. But thats why i believe we should stay w/ the electoral collage because we have used this method for so long & yes there were a few hiccups here & there but not every system we use is perfect & for how long we've bee using this one i say why change now!?

6F37A73465F2,"Now, for some people, cars are a way of life. Nothing pleases them more than the feeling of a stering wheel on their hands, or the growl of a healthy engine. Those people probably could never live without their cars, but you probably can. Well, maybe not living without cars entirely, but at least reducing your use of them. It'll be a lot safer for the environment, and it'll cause a lot less traffic jams. So let's see why you can go a few more days without your prized Hoda Civic.

Now, you've probably had this fact jammed down your throat more times than you care to count, but, cars produce a lot of gas, which isn't really easy on the environment.  According to the New York Times article, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50  percent in  some car-intensive areas in the United States."" And according to the Chicago Tribune article, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, ""Last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter."" So, less car usage means less greenhouse emissions. Yes, there are cars out there that are more ""fuel-efficient,"" but they still require lots of energy from the environment. Not only that, but using your car less often will mean that you won't have to deal with one of the biggest evils in the world.........traffic.

Now, think, when have you ever been stuck in traffic and actually enjoyed it? Now, if you were to ride a bicycle or take a subway, you wouldn't have to deal with that! Already, some cities around the world are finding alternative ways to avoid those jams. ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,"" by Andrew Selsky, tells of how the capital of Colombia is doing so. ""It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths...Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaraunts and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" This means you'll be able to get to work or to that first date a lot quicker! Sure, people using less cars would strike a big blow in the automobile industry, but you don't neccesarily have to never drive a car again! What about on those long road trips, or when you have to carry a lot of passengers with you? A car would come in handy in such scenarios, but not neccesarily every scenario.

In summary, driving less would be more efficient because it means cleaner air and less highway congestion. So, after reading all of this information, do you think that you have what it takes to get from point A to point B without having to get into a driver's seat? can you take your hand off of the steering wheel long enough to open yourself up to other transportation options? Go ahead, try.      ",0,0.0068586897,0,True

Summer projects should be student designed because students will be more inclined to do the project, student projects are unique and it is a good experience for the youth.

Students will be more intrigued by projects created by their peers. Projects assigned by teachers are often dull and pointless. Having seen many projects assigned by adults, students understand the basis of a quality project idea. Peer designed projects are often more fun, as it was created by a young creative mind. Students will be more interested in taking part in student -designed projects over the summer.

Student -designed projects are very unique, as they have participated in numerous projects. Teachers assign multiple projects per class in a given year.

E353EF820872,"As technological advancements increase, it is becoming easier for people to work and complete daily tasks from home. Whether it be joining a video conference or ordering groceries to one's front door, people do not need to leave their house nearly as often as they had in the past. Not only does this affect adults, but can also affect students trying to learn. Many schools give the option to allow students to learn from the comfort of their own home; however, learning from home is not nearly as useful as learning in school. Students with the ability to attend classes at a school would not benefit from attending classes from home because of the interactions made with real people.

Students can develop important social skills when at school. There are some skills that people cannot learn by someone teaching them. The only way to get or practice these skills is to learn from experience. This means one needs to be put in a situation where this skill is useful and try their best to learn from the experience. Learning to be social and to interact with others are some of these skills. The perfect place to practice these important skills is at school, where one is constantly surrounded by their peers. While at school, students are constantly put in situations that force them to interact with other students. Skills like these can be useful in future jobs and in a multitude of different situations in life. If students did not have to attend school to take classes, then they could grow up completely lacking these crucial skills. In order to prevent this anti-social future, students should go to school to take classes, where they benefit more.

Additionally, students learn more by directly interacting with teachers. Teachers are crucial assets to the future of the entire world. In order to continue advance society in many different ways, teachers are needed to educate children, teens, and young adults. To allow students to grow and develop in the best way possible, students need to have close and meaningful interactions with their teachers. Online or on a video call, students do not learn in the same beneficial way that students do in school. They do not receive the important interactions with their teachers. This leads to a lack of truly understanding and learning the material being taught. The only way to obtain this understanding is for students to have meaningful interaction with their educator. In all, students benefit far more from being educated in a school because they directly work and interact with their teacher.

It is important that some students, ones with disabilities or restrictions making it difficult to attend school, have access to classes from their homes. It is not fair for those who struggle to get from class to class or those who cannot get themselves to school to lose out on their educational opportunity our country gives them. In order to achieve true equity, it is only right that these students are given special exceptions. Even though learning online is not as beneficial to students as learning in person, for students that cannot go to school, a slightly limited education is much better than no education at all. However, this does not mean everyone should be able to learn at home, online, if they do not like going to school. Special circumstances should be made for those who need it, as allowing everyone to have an education is vital.

Everywhere around the globe, students should not take the opportunity of learning at a school for granted. Children, teens, and young adults truly benefit from interacting with their classmates and teachers. Even though online classes are very important, especially to those who cannot get to school everyday, what is learned in an actual school is far more significant for growing students. Now, the advancement in technology, like leaning online, is extremely useful for almost everybody on this planet, but humans cannot forget how to be social and how to interact with each other in real life. If people do forget these things, then society itself will be dead.",0,0.0075673545,0,True

We are think about the summer they can take the class online but, is not a good idea because some students they forget to wake up for take the class or make the homework and they don't care .So this year we taking the class in the school they need to make all the homework and projects they are missed .

the teacher can help all the student to make the project and homework during the summer break if they make the project very good they can get better grade in the classes .

We don't have anywhere else to go if we keep killing earth. The government should take action and try to get the people out of cars and on bycicles.

In Paris, the government banned certain cars to drive on certian days. In Robert Duffer's article it explains which cars are banned, ""On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered tro leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day."" Paris takes action in hopes to help their air pollution. The smog was so bad it ""rivaled Beijing, China"".

Vaugban, Germany tries an experiment. They make a suburb with real people, going to real life jobs without cars. This is one of the first car-free cities and it was great. Life continued, people still breathed, society was advancing without any help from a combersome vehicle. Not only did this city help with air pollution but it got people up and outside! People walked or used bycicles to get to where their were headed. Exercise is the one thing almost everyone pushes off but now with no cars you have to get that exercise in order to get to work! Mother and media trainer, Heidrun Walter said '""When I had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way""'.

Even in Bogota, Colombia people believe '""It's a good oppertunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.""' Eventhough Germany didn't allow a single car, Colombia did allow there to be public transportation only( busses and taxis). The people are happy and content with this simplistic lifestyle, so much so that other cities have joined the event! This goes to show that society doesn't need cars. We can take control of our life but lately we have been letting technology control the way we live.

In the article NASA unveiled the picture for all to see and THEY captioned it ""huge rock formation"" . Which basicly means even NASA doen't think it was aliens who created it. Also after the articles states what NASA captioned the picture, it says ""formed by shadows giving the ALLUSION of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Its just an allusion not even a face really.

Also, the aticle says ""there was no alien monument arter all."" if NASA really believed aliens did that I don't think NASA would release it to the world. I'm sure the government is strict on them on releasing things to the public. NASA probably wanted people to pay attention to them so they can have their one minute fame. Skeptics think alien marking were hidden by haze. Come on really, all the great technology NASA has and you think it was hidden behind clouds.

The technology they have is great. When they finally got a clear shot to take a picture, they took it. After they took it, they zoomed in three times bigger... nothing. NASA said if there were any small shacks or evidence of aircraft you would have seen what they were. Marvin, from NASA says it reminded him of landforms created on Earth, so if an expert that works at NASA

thinks that it was created by a landform, then why do we think it was an alien or aliens that created it?

Like tomorrow this can't be stoped people are going to make cars that can drive them selves.

But cars that drive them selves would be a tariable thing for this world.

Driverless cars would not be good because a computer can not react like a human can, we would loose jobs and this would effect the economy, and because they limmit the freedom of the passanger.

Driverless cars would not be a good thing because a computer does not react like a human.

Humans naturaly have a reflex that a computer doesn't, we see something run into the road and we know weather to slam on the breaks (in the case of a child) or run over it in hope you don't hit it (in the case of a squwarl).

A computer could mistake these suck objects and thus causing another problem of is it ""the driver or the manufacturer"" (10).

Also in the case where the car would control the speed of the car.

Say you were driving a woman to the hospidle because se is going into labor, or someone needs medical attenshion and you need to drive them there.

In cases such as these going the speed limit is not the best thing.

You would need to go over in order to save or help the person.

For reasones like this a computer as a driver would not be a good idea.

In the state of Indiana the manufacturing of car is one of the economical exports that we have.

If you were to take all those jobs and take them out to California to build driverless cars, that would hurt the economy of Indiada.

Also what about other formes of trancportation that require a driver?

The taxies of New York, or the local buses that run all over the country? what would happen to bus drivers jobs, would they all be replaced with driverless cars? For that reason of hurting the economy driverless cars would not benifit America.

Driverless cars also would restrict the freedoms of the individuwal.

Say you were of a drive and you wanted to go throught backroads to see the landscape, would the driverless car take you there or would it take you on the main highways? In these driverless cars how would the passanger be incontrol at all? Technology may be atvancing in many ways than one but I don't want the way I travel to be restricted.

Driverless cars would be horiable because computers can't react like a human can, we would loose jobs and it would effect the economy, and because they limmit the freedom of the passanger.

For all these reasons we should not have driverless cars.

Pluse haven't we seen enought movies where there are driverless cars and robots walking the streets that take over the world?

Variouse movies have been created like these and every day we come closer to robots taking over the world. I don't want that and I think we should provail it as much as possiable starting with the driverless cars.  ",0,0.007657105,0,True
A2979F6CB12B,"Some students, during a break like summer break, can forget a lot of information they have learned throughout the school year. With more schools including the addition of summer projects, this problem can be eliminated. Even so, should the responsibility of the project's design fall on the teacher or the student? Summer projects should be student-designed because it allows students to have fun and get better grades.

The first reason summer projects should be student-designed is sheer enjoyment. When a student, or anyone, has a break or vacation, they are going to want to enjoy it. Having to to do work on something students are interested in will make it that much easier for students to find time to finish the project in the first place. We all can relate to a time when we were given a piece of work that did not interest us at, but had to do it anyway. These struggles are not things students should be dealing with when on vacation.

Another reason summer projects should be student-designed is the increased chance of getting a better grade. Higher chances of getting a better grade ties in greatly with enjoyment as a cause-and-effect reaction. The reaction is if the students enjoy the projects they design, then they will more likely put effort into their projects and if they put more effort into their projects, then they are more likely get a higher grade. Most students, when receiving a project during a break, are not going to want to do said project which will lead some students to outright skip it. Self-made projects will decrease the chances of this to occur and increase the outcome from this non-occurrence.

Some may argue that teachers designing summer projects will make the content more academic and overall increase the students capacity for remembering information, but this is not the case. The most this will do for students is help them retain the information for the first small part of summer break and not the rest because they would have already stopped doing the project because it lost their interest. A goal for a project during a break should be to retain the most information whilst letting the student get the most out of their break.

In conclusion, the best way to get students engaged in a project is to make it fun. Keeping the project academic while letting the student highlight the best of their own abilities can not only make the student feel better about their own work, but feel good knowing that they are going to do great the following year. ",0,0.0074202237,0,True
4739D03E52FB,"I remember being in the yearbook club in 7th grade and enjoying the experience, well this doesnt carry for everyone. Forcing kids into extracurricular activities wouldn't be fair, people can be busy after school, parents can't pick them up, and they just not find interest in these activities or be in ones outside of the school.

Firstly, every kid at one point has had chores or are still doing chores and from experience their time consuming which could easily lead to a kid being to busy for a club or sport, kids could also have part time jobs like babysitting or mowing the neighbors lawn, and they could have a job that requires them after school. Chores are vital to keep a house running in most cases. Things like doing the dishes so dishes don't build is a major one for a nicer and cleaner house, and maybe its the kids job to do them after school. Another issue with this is the fact that some kids babysit and other small jobs this means they have things to do at certain times and places. Some kids in middle school and high school have jobs and can't stay after due to schedule.

Secondly, most parents have jobs and with those jobs comes times where maybe they cant pick up their kid, this means that the kid would be stuck at the school waiting or have to go alone which based on where you are could be unsafe. Family members like a grandma or grandpa could be busy or not able to drive which could make them unavailable to pick kids up after school. Kids couldn't get home on their own, walking could be an option but some parents don't want their kids walking due to safety issues or concerns.

Lastly, there are some clubs and sports that the school doesn't host that kids could go to, like another team outside of the school teams or the clubs might be a out of town or start right after school. Sports are hosted outside of schools like some teams for soccer or basket ball, so the kid could already be on a preexisting team and this probably wouldn't count to the required amount. Finally, some kids could dislike or not find interest in the activities available leaving them either forced into a sport or forcing themselves into a sport they don't like.

In conclusion, the idea of required extracurricular activities sounds pointless, kids could be busy with work, might not be able to work with their parents schedule, and they could be involved with something else outside of school and might not like the selection given. the idea of a extracurricular activity being required sounds like it could mess with peoples out of school jobs and or things, plus parents would have to be involved and most can't all the time.",0,0.007959178,0,True

B73FE4F761D2,"When someone is in desperate, urgent need of guidance, just one person may not have the answer. To achieve the most dependable help, one must access different sources. Requesting many diverse perspectives will help a person make the best decision because it will present them with more options and suggest the logicality behind their own ideas.

As more assistance is sought out, more feedback will be received. For starters, it is important that everyone's viewpoint is considered before finalizing your own, because a peer may have a wiser alternative. As I once trapped myself between a wall of choices, I was indecisive beyond imaginable; however, my mother came to me with a brand new thought that I had never conjured as a possibility. I soon followed through with her recommendation and was well on my way across the blockade that I had once stumbled upon.

Also, when given multiple thoughts, the ability is there for the seeker to choose which one they prefer. No matter whom is asked, every adviser will have an opinion on the situation the learner possesses. As a result, it is possible to debate the pros and cons of any given suggestion to reach an ultimate solution.

Another example is the availability of compiling every resolution that is offered. There is no requirement for someone in distress to choose only one; therefor, it is always reasonable to form one's own method of progress using what they have already thought of as well as heard. This strategy will build a bridge between all helpful spoken words of helpers.

Considering this, the most effective conclusion is not one that comes only from the viewpoints of one person.

The motivation and speech that the scouter is presented with will question the reasoning for future actions that they would have tried to complete.

Additionally, only by pointing out the reasons certain things are better than another will anyone see why they truly are. Discussing specific matters with those who are around will open the door to the realization of the successes that have been a result before. These positives outweigh the negatives and compel people to utilize their processes.

Not to mention the experience that has created the viewpoints of others. From their own hardships and struggles, mentors will know what is a credible thing to go by. Being taught about the things these people went through will assure the listener that there are more rational things to do. Using the past decisions of elders as a format for one's own will offer assistance in the improvement of an open mind's supposed best way to solve a problem.

Finally, by explaining to others one's own plans, those who are willing to help can express the inevitable downfalls when proceeding with that plan. To any given person, it is difficult to see the flaws in what they thought of to be one of the most magnificent things they had ever contemplated. It is much less difficult to recognize the fatalities that will arise from such things when the composer is not their own judge. By bringing awareness to these dangers and failures, both people can discover what causes the disadvantages and work to formulate something of better benefit.

Knowing the effects of countless diverse future and past attempts will encourage someone to rethink their own.

A reasonable method becomes clear when a young mind uses the chance to ponder numerous alternatives because they serve as additional viewpoints as well as the opportunity to find the stability in previously devised possibilities. In the end, what one thinks is best will be what they want to do. For their own well being, every source should be consulted and always thought over.",0,0.006932622,0,True
4885E69D7C24,"Have you ever asked for advice or opinions from a variety people? I know I always ask a multiple people for advice. I get opinions and advice from my friends and family on many different things like outfits and school. Asking for multiple people's advice is often the best choice because you then have multiple perspectives, honest opinions, and you can go off on what the majority of people say.

The first reason asking a variety of people for their advice could be that you would receive multiple perspectives. For instance you will get different opinions from each person you ask advice from. They'll tell you what they think you should fix or do and they can also help you decide on something and how to get through obstacles. An example of getting multiple perspectives could be that your struggling to tell if an outfit looks good, so you send a picture to your friends asking what they think and then they give their opinions.

The second reason asking multiple people for their advice is for their honest opinions. When you ask for advice people are almost always going to tell you exactly what they think. Therefore people will help you to not make a fool of yourself, and tell you their opinion on whether something is good or not and if they believe what your doing or about to do is the right choice. An example of honest opinions is, your debating whether you should skip class or not, so you ask your two friends and while one says yes the other tells you not to and explains why its bad to skip.

The final reason asking others for their advice is the best choice is because you base your final decision off of the majority of what people say. Majority is useful when asking for advice from a group of people because it helps you have a clearer image of what you need to do and it helps you see how many people stated the same or different opinion. For example if you have 3 friends and you ask them all what color shirt you should wear and two of them say blue and one says pink, your going to go with the blue shirt because more people advised that you wear the blue shirt.

In conclusion, asking a variety of people for their advice is better because it helps you get honest opinions, multiple perspectives, and a final decision based off of the majority of what people say. People should always ask for advice because it helps take off pressure and it can help them to live a calmer and more sure life. Sometimes people try to do things all by themselves but in reality if they just ask for help or a little bit of advice from others they can save themselves from some stress and anxiety. It's also nice to ask others for their opinions because it makes them feel like you care about what they have to say.

215C53EE2A44,"Autonimous cars are a reality. Corporations such as Google, General Motors, and enigineers at Berkley have all created, to a certain extent, autonimous vehicles. A few more companies including Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan have announced their plans to have autonimous vehicles by 2020. But are autonimous vehicles really the best? Who would be responsible for crashes? Will they be as safe as regullar vehicles? Will they be able to be hacked? Even though the autonimous car is possible is it really safe?

First, how would autonimous vehicles respond to a wreck? It is clearly stated in paragraph 7 ""but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills"". So what happens in the event of a crash? One car wrecks and it causes a huge domino effect. One car after another, pile up because they do not know how to deal with the situation.

Second, in the event of a wreck who is responsible? The owner of the vehicle or the manufacturer? While the vehicle does belong to the owner and he did know about potential problems, the manufacturer should be able to deliver a completely safe vehicle to a customer.

That brings me to another issue. No one can confrim 100% that an autonimous vehicle will not wreck. There wil alway be human error in the manufactoring process. Now you might say; but they will be assembled by robots, so there wont be any human error. Well: who assembled the robots, who programmed them? Humans did, thus introducing human error into the problem.

Another thing to be worried about is terrorism. Will these cars be able to be hacked? A terrorist could hack into an autonimous vehicle and use for whatever he desires. He could drive a bomb anywhere he wants. No place would be safe or out of rech of a terrorist.

As you can see there are many propposed problems with autonimous cars. Wrecks, responsibility, human error, and terrorism are just a few of them. The truth is that there will always be some sort of problem with autonimous cars. Glitches and human error willl make sure of that.

A cell phone definitely comes in handy in some everyday situations, but is it necessary to use it in school when all of the tools that you need are handed to you? These are questions that most students don't really ask themselves. They complain about not being able to use their phone in school, but why do they need to use it? So does a cell phone immediately turn into a distraction as soon as it hits a school campus?

Now, I'm as much of a kid as the next guy, and I use my cell phone probably just as much, but I've never needed it in a school situation unless I was just plain lazy. People say that they wouldn't use their cell phone to text in school, but to use it as a resource. Well, when a student sneaks and uses their cell phone in class, are they using it to solve the question in front of them or telling their friend how bored they are at the moment? My point exactly. Rarely is a cell phone taken out for a helpful use. Also, if cell phones are legalized in the school system, then how often would cell phones get used then? With out the danger and risk in using a cell phone, the students won't find much of a use for them then.

Another argument might be that they need to call/text their mom to inform her of something that's extremely important. Well, if it's something of that nature of emergency, then that's why there is such thing as an office phone. If your sick, ask if you can go to the clinic, then the clinic will diagnose you, then give you the option to call your mom and ask anything that you may need to ask. Why permit cell phones when you have an already functional process at hand? Same goes with if you need something dropped off at the school.

ad1dac3c,"Almost every American has a car. Just go outside and look at your neighborhood.. I'm almost positive if you were to look everyone would have a car except for maybe 1 or 2.. The car is in our everyday use basically.. It helps us get to work, run aarons, take kids to school, etc. Now you may seem like theres only 1 risk of being in a car, but believe it or not.. When your car is on and running you're hurting the air.. Now I know the air doesn't have feelings! But logically you're hurting the air and yourself. America should limit car usage for simple reasons like air pollution, car accidents, and laziness. These are the things we should focus on when we're in our cars or when we talk about safety because all those reasons fall into that category. Small changes would be nice and helpful here. It reduce lot of problems we have, and stress.

To kick this off, limiting the usage of cars would reduce the amount of air pollution that we are surrounded in now. Think about it millions of cars on and running everyday, sometimes if you look closely thers black gas coming out of the exhaust pipe.. And you're breating that? Out of millions of cars where do you think all those fumes go? they don't just dissapear! We're breating it! sure you might say ""So if im breathing it doesn't that mean i should be dead?!"" no.. that's not the case.. Yes it's bad for you but it hurts the earth mostly the gases break apart the atmosphere we have around to block other fumes from other places out. Think of the earth as a hamster in a ball.. The hamster is the earth and the ball is out atmosphere. The holes in the ball are the holes made from the gases that are released from our cars. This could let any type if gas in. In places like China there's a huge problem caused by all the cars.. it's called smog. Think of fog all over the place but its black and smells really bad. Not only that but it's really bad for you. You may think why don't we have that here? Well China is the most populated country in the world and almost everyone has a car. China is a pretty busy place you'd imagine because of all the people. Well you're right.. All the fumes coming out of those cars cause all that smog to contaminate everything there. Like water, animals, food, and even you! It's very bad. China needs to limit the usage of their cars in order to stop problems like that because it can effect everything around them. We should start worrying about the smog aswell because America is a pretty big place and all the busy cars can cause something similar to a smog, it may not be as big bu it will still cause damage. With all this said hopefully you understand what air pollution does and how we can reduce it.

Moving along, Car accidents is a very big thing everywhere it causes thousands of deaths and injuries. We can stop all of it if we can limit the car usuage. you may say ""We can also just stop teens from driving.."" well yeah you can do that but how will they learn for themselves? Small rules metioned in the article are very interesting like cars with even licence plates were allowed to drive on mondays for example, and cars who drove with odd licence plates were fined for not obeying the law. On Tuesdays it would be the same but for odd licence plates. I think if this rules was implemented atleast 2 times a week it would help reduce the amount of accidents. There wouldn't be asmuch cars and it will be lot safer for people to drive. Sadly in lot of accidents they are fatal in highways, just imagine hundrends of thousands of cars driving in 34 lanes, you hit a car and it will obivously start a big problem from there. Think of it like dominos stacked in a line you knock one down and it just starts all tumbling in order. Yeah some cars avoid it but not always. The less the cars the less the accidents. Altough this is off topic but limiting the amount of cars on a freeway or highway per hour will limit the amount of accidents aswell. Back to the point, America needs to do something about the cars or it will just keep happening the more the drivers the more the danger out in the roads and highways. Hopefully this helped you understand more about the limiting of car use a little more.

We're almost there, how ever we should stop revolving our selves around our car. If you live 10 minutes away from a supermarket or small convienience store just walk there.. You're just wasting money and polluting the air driving there.. A bike is a great way to get there you go decently fast, you don't get tired as much and it's a good exercise. We should stop getting to lazy because it is affecting both us and the earth very negatively. I would understand if you're in a hurry but seriously.. If you're 1020 minutes walking distance why not just walk there.. You don't only exercise in the gym, get some fresh air outside.. well partially fresh air.. Yeah you get the point.. We need to get our butts up and walk places because our car isn't our only source of transportation! It's not just hurting you! Don't forget your purse or wallet! Because it has a big impact on that to with the gas prices going all over the place right now. Something people don't see when they're driving there car is what there doing to the enviornment, yeah i've mentioned it many times but it something we really need to look at because it effects your health tremendously. If you actually take the time to walk or bike to where ever you want it feels nice to actually walk and stretch your muscles out. We need more car reduced communities so that we don't just use our cars all day to get to places not to far away.

To conclude, we need to start limiting the usage of cars in order to reduce lot of problems in our enviornment. Most of our enviornmental problems revolve around something we use everyday which is the car. Problems such as air pollution, car accidents, and laziness. These things just don't effect you, if effects everyone including the envornment. This is something we should look out for ecause it is a very negative thing we have. Mainly air pollution because that affects everything.. And i mean everthing... Food, water, animals, plants, and even you.. So we all should look out for this and be a bt more responsible. We need more laws to help reduce the amount of smog and greenhouse gases that we have here today in our world.

""Why consider a new method of transportation?,"" you may ask. If we limited the car usage we would have great amouts of adavantages as a result.

One important result that would come if we limited car usage is having nearby store locations near by. "" In this new approach stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in a malls along some distant highway.""(Source one: In german Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars; paragraph six) Limiting car usage will result in new buildings, stores, houses to become at a fair enough distance to walk.

If we had stores nearby enough to walk, there's no need of a car. If car usages reduces, the amount of walking, or riding a bike would increase. This will lead to a better life style. Recent studies has showed that walking daily can improve a persons mind. ""When I had car i was always tense, I'm much happier this way.""( Source one: In German Suburb, Life goes on Without Cars; paragraph three.)

Another major positive affect that will result in reducing car usage is improving our atmosphere. One disadvantage cars cause, is air pollution. One example would be smog. The smog that we breath in is not good for our health.""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.""(Source three;paragrpah twenty-four). Not only if we reduce car usage we would gain positives outcomes but  we would reduce  pollution.

""Passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emmisons in Europe...and up to fifty percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" (Source one; paragraph five.)  We would be doing positive thing for ourself but a positive thing for the enviroment.

Our generation does not need to rely on a piece of mechanic to take them to their destination. We have the ability to get to our route, and have other options that are helpful for us and for our enviroment. We have multiple advantages if we would consider to reduce car usage. So the question would be, why dont we stop using cars, and start helping ourself and our enviroment knowing the  advantages we could be recieving in return.                                                        ",0,0.0073815593,0,True

In the day of age, 25% of car crashes involve driving while using phones. That is a huge number and already 1 reason why you shouldn't drive while using a phone. I will give you some reasons why you shouldn't drive with phones.

Fatal injury or death is one reason. You are in a big metal vehicle in which case, can crash. When crashed, multiple things could happen to you. Burning, crushed, stabbed is few of the things that can injure, or kill you. Your not affecting youself, but affecting people who probably got hit while you crashed. You might have or had killed them.

Another is jail time or bieng sued. If you had hit a person, another car, or property damage, you can get arrested for that. The fine cost could go up to 500,000$ and a jail time for a minimum of 2 years.

ED6070D470FF,"I despise it when someone your close to says ""you can't be like me you have to be better than that."" What right do you have to speak on what I have done, when you have done things people could not even imagine? This is why when it comes to someone you look up too or base your personality off of, make sure it is one who has credibility. Like people always say ""you are who you hang around with."" For example, being around friends who act in illegal activities your bound to do those things too. A man with honor, integrity, and takes responsibility for what he does will be respected because of his behavior.

Being a good role model is especially true when it comes to children. For example, have you ever had a little cousin or your bestfriend's baby sibling copy the same exact words that come out of your mouth? Be careful what you talk about around a kid because they repeat what you say; furthermore, it might not seem like it, but they can process everything you say. This is how in parts of the country people have various accents and pronounce words differently. When you grow up in a certain neighborhood or even in you household, while aging you will be using the different terms and phrases people around you use because that's all you ever known growing up. So staying away from words that can't be used in a school or around familly is your best bet.

A celebrity has an even greater audience when it comes to setting an example for others. People of all types of ages watch them, they are the ones who set the trends, the news revolves around, and control social media. When a celebrity messes up they get the most hate; however, if a celebrity does a great deed like a charity event then they're praised for it. They attract the most attention and most of those eyes are teenagers, who need the most advice and a figure to follow. For teenagers this is who decides for them if they'll be on the streets or in the books because famous people are who they spend most of their time with. Teenagers are always watching, whether on social media, a reality show, a sports game, or a movie, celebrities are dominating the world right now.

No mater who it is, a person always have some type of influence on somebody. That is why you should just hold that anger in next time you get in a fight because people are watching. Do some charity or show them you cleaning up the environment; in addition, just effect others in a positive way. However some would say setting example does not matter or no one pays attention to that, it is suprising how many people are effected by a person's behavior. Showing a good example with behavior does not necessarily mean change who you are, it just means be careful of the words that are exiting your mouth. No one would want their own kid to be effected by a bad role model.",0,0.007649728,0,True

First, they would learn in a better way, also people need someone to advise them. As well, the world would not be destroy as it is now.

People would learn in better way. To begin, if people seek the guidance from experts they would not make a lot of mistake, and their life would be better. For example, a person who seek the guidance from experts it would have more opportunities. Likewise, a student who doesn't understand math class can talk with his teacher or other expert in math and the teacher can explain it. On the other hand, if the student doesn't talk to anyone he provably would fail math. In addition, a person who get a new job need someone to explain it what to do. While, if nobody explain it the new employee would make many mistakes. As you can see, the people who take the advise of a experts would learn better.

People need someone to advise them. For example, everybody have problems, but not everybody have someone to advise them. First, a new student came to my school and he didn't know the rules of the school, so he did something that it wasn't good and he get in big trouble, but if someone would explain him he would't get any trouble. Therefore, many teenager do whatever they want because they doesn't have anyone to guide them, and the result of that is those teenager get it many troubles each day. While, the teenager who are guide for any expert they do well in everything they do. As you can see, everyone need someone to guide for the right way, and nobody would do a lot of mistakes.

The world would not be destroy as it is today. For example, if everyone would have the opportunity to have someone to advice them the world would'n be danger to anyone. Furthermore, in many countries the people are in danger because their governors doesn't know how to guide a country, but if an expert took the control of the government the people would not be in danger anymore. Likewise, teenager sometimes live by them-self, so they don't have anyone to tell them what is good and what is bad; teenager many times do bad things and they don't even know. As I repeat, if the whole world would have someone to guide everyone the world would not be destroy as it's today, everything would be in peace.

In conclusion, if everyone would have the opportunity to have an expert guide during life the entire world would be better. Likewise, people would make better choices in their life. Also, with a expert guide the people nobody would be in danger again. Furthermore, teenagers and kids would have a better future around the world; as well, the world would be in peace, and people would learn in a better way. Also, if someone doesn't know something he/she can talk with an expert and the expert would guide her/him.

099CAB3EA5C6,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author suggests that studying our sister planet is worth the risks and dangers it possesses. Often referred to as Earth's ""twin"" or the ""Evening Star"", Venus has proven many times that exploration is close to impossible for spacecrafts, let alone humans. ""Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours"". This sentence in paragraph 2 already shows signs of uncertainty in the author's claim. Although the author mentions that Venus may instill curiosity in humans, the dangers and inhospitable conditions that he also mentions contradict the point he is trying to get across.

Throughout the entire passage, the author provides both negative and positive facts about the idea of human exploration of Venus. Although providing negative aspects might be his idea of a counterargument, the bad outweighs the good in this scenario. ""Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface"" (paragraph 3). This statement, full of reasons not to explore Venus, provides a contradictory tone and idea. The author even starts the sentence with ""Beyond high pressure and heat"", which demonstrates the fact that he is adding on more negative aspects to a previously mentioned negative aspect.

The uncertain author also mentions that ""most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective"". This piece of information alone defeats a large purpose of exploration: getting photographic evidence. ""More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance"". This statement also defeats a huge purpose of exploration: getting physical evidence. Without this ability, scientists would have to get very close to the surface despite the risks. One things that the author mentions to support his claim is that the risks should be thought of or seen as challenges. This change from a negative word to a positive helps to support his claim and provide insight to his passionate opinion.

The author mentions more cons than pros, but he seems to stick with his claim and brush off each negative in the last part of the passage, paragraph 8. ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited to dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"". This concluding statement shows that the author is urging humans to be fearless and hungry for exploration and innovation. The author also believes that ""human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors"" anyway. Although this claim sounds more like an assumption, he is trying to show that if humans can explore other dangerous areas of Earth and space, then they can also overcome that obstacles that prevent them from doing the same to Venus.

Although the author mentions that Venus may instill curiosity in humans, the dangers and inhospitable conditions that he also mentions contradict the point he is trying to get across. All in all, the author fails to fully support his claim that Venus is a worthy pursuit desipte the dangers it presents. The facts and evidence prove his claim wrong, and he only provides an inspirational conclusion to create a distraction from the reailty of the situation. With the author providing facts like spacecrafts surviving only a few hours and frequent natural disasters on the planet, he tears down his own claim and gives more reasons as to why this exploration cannot work than why it can.",0,0.0069511975,0,True
d30cce81,"Starting with the end of World War II, cars have been a cultural hub all around the world, with businesses and even entire economies relying on the production and sale of cars and car products. However, after over sixty years of a car based global economy, the use of cars is beginning to slowly decline. With the decline of car usage, we see decreases in greenhouse gas pollution, a more relaxed living style, and the dawn of a new era of culture and economy around the globe.

Several major cities around the world have attempted to lower caruse through laws or even annual days devoted to reduced caruse. In Vauban, Germany, seventy percent of the population does not own a car, and fifty three percent of that population sold a car to move to Vauban. Vauban has condensed its suburban layout so that everything is within practical walking range for the most part. They have also discouraged caruse by making parking only available in two places, ""Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to parklarge garages at the edge of the development, where a carowner buys a space, for 40,000, along with a home"" Rosenthal, paragraph 2. Vauban has reported drastic reductions in greenhouse gases. Passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to fifty percent in the United States. The Environmental Protection Agency in the United States is promoting ""carreduced"" communites in order to cut down greenhouse gas emissions, and legislators are acting on the issue. Experts claim that public transportation is beginning to play a larger role in suburbs, and a larger budget is now being given to public transportation instead of highways. Paris also has reduced driving to reduce smog, but they did it through laws. After suffering recordbreaking pollution, Paris enforced a partial ban on driving. On Monday, evennumbered license plates could not drive, or they would be fined twenty two euros, or about thirty one dollars. On Tuesday, the same thing applied to odds. From this driving ban, congestion was lowered up to sixty percent in the French capital. Throughout multiple global cities, these reductions of caruse have had a significant impact on greenhouse gas emissions, and more cities are beginning to join in.

Along with the benifit of reduced greenhouse gases, carreduced societies also have a more relaxed living style. In Vauban Germany, citizens have claimed that they are enjoying a more relaxed life with much less stress. Heidrun Walter was quoted in Elisabeth Rosenthal's article ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" Rosenthal, paragraph 3. Andrew Selsky's article on carfree days in Bogota, Colombia also states that people enjoy the relief of less stress when they don't use their cars. ""'It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution' said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a twoseat bicycle with his wife"" Selsky, paragraph 24. If a drop in caruse leads to a happier, healthier life style, this will most likely set off a cyclicle action of caruse reduction to relief of stress and back to caruse reduction. As more people realize this potential benifit of reducing caruse, more people will beginning to join the population of reduced caruse.

The vast empire of cars that began with the end of World War II has reached its peak and is beginning a steady decline. For nearly seventy years, cars and car products have been a cultural and economical stimulant in both developed and developing countries. From the ModelT to the Buggatti, cars have been percieved as the thing to have over radios, television, and other mass media. Now that they are becoming less used, culture will slowly begin to shift to a different source to hype about. The production of new models of cars and new types of cars will slow and eventually halt all together. As well as culture evolving to a new phase, economy will also undergo major changes. Economy all around the world has been stimulated by auto industries, and international trade has been influenced heavily by it. For example, foreign cars are driven in America more often than domesticallymanufactured cars. Now that caruse is declining, the economy will suffer a major crash in stocks in the auto industry. Although this crash will harm the economy, the everchanging population of Earth will quickly find some new innovation to obssess over and the market will quickly recover and improve on this new product. With a new culture and economy, the world will be in a new era, a new age of living.

With the decline of car usage, we see decreases in greenhouse gas pollution, a more relaxed living style, and a possibilty of a new era of culture and economy around the globe. As the problems with cars are found, people have and will continue to resolve the problem by reducing caruse. The Earth will become healthier with a nicer atmosphere, the population will lead happier lives, and culture itself will transform with the end of major caruse.",0,0.008477039,0,True

Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I believe that you should change the policy from having to have an B average to play sports. Most of the kids that play sports have an C average. Well most of the students in the school have an C average. You should change it to C average because maybe they had all A' s and one C that was an eighty four. They was one point away from having an B now they can't play spots because of that one point. I also think you should change it to an C because C is the average persons grade. Most people have an hard time learning things and keeping up with sports so they might make an C on their report card, but an C isn't an bad grade it might not be an A or B but its not bad. I think if you change it we want have anyone participating in sports. Then other schools are going to look at our school like we are boring and be like ""I don't want to go there because they are lame."" We don't want that we want people to look at our school and say ""They have an good athletic field I want to try that school out."" We don't want them looking at the school as an loser school or boring , do we ? What if an parent(s) want to see their kids play but they made an C so they got kicked off the team. The parent(s) are going to be mad that they paid all that money and their child has got kicked off the team. We want to work with the parent(s) not make them mad or angry. That's what's going to happen if you change the average to B. We're going to have a lot of angry parent(s) coming to the school. We don't want an angry mob surrounding the school because their child had got kicked off their favorite sport team. So you should keep it at an C average to make parents, students, outsiders looking in and teachers happy. We don't want the students in class talking about ""We would of won if i had of played."" Then they wouldn't be thinking about school. So you think about that and thank you for taking time out your day to read this letter.

BC9EB6EF2B1D,"Extracurricular activities are an excellent way for students to expand their knowledge and skills beyond the classes they are taking in school. Many of these are beneficial in teaching you skills that will be valuable for the rest of your life, such as time management, balancing work, and working with others. I think that a principal making at least one extracurricular activity required is a great idea, as it would encourage students to step out of their comfort zone and attempt something they haven't before, build valuable skills for future careers, and be a good place to meet new people and socialize.

Many students are only focused on their academics in school, not doing much else outside of it. Requiring an extracurricular activity will definitely expose more students to additional opportunities. Joining a student organized band may encourage someone to pick up and start learning an instrument. Participating on a track team may help someone realize that they are a good runner. A student helping with the yearbook may find the graphic design aspect enjoyable and become a web designer. The more opportunities a person is exposed to, the more options they have for future careers and hobbies.

Another beneficial aspect of requiring an extracurricular activity is that many students would learn valuable skills that will help them out greatly later in life. Most clubs/activities promote teaching multiple life and career skills for those who join. Model United Nations teaches students problem solving and leadership skills. All sports activities promote living a healthy and active lifestyle. A community service club shows the value of helping your community, and helping those who are in need. Giving students a chance to learn more career skills will exponentially increase the chances of them being successful later in life.

One of the greatest parts of extracurricular activities is the people in them. You can meet some people with similar interests as you. Joining extracurricular activities would give everyone a much greater chance at finding some good friends, or at the very least some people to talk to while doing the activity. People in a coding or robotics club could find they have a mutual enjoyment of gaming. Someone in an art club may find that other people there enjoy the art style used in comic books. Students talking to people in these activities who share their interests would help them find friends they never would in their normal classes.

Extracurricular activities are a good thing for any student to join. Whether it be after school clubs, a sport outside of the school, or playing an instrument. It would give students new people to talk to and socialize with, skills for careers they may be pursuing currently or will be pursuing in the future, and would push people out of their comfort zone. The principal requiring extracurricular activities is a great idea, which would give many benefits to every student who participates. ",0,0.93196553,1,False
81BCB1DE23B7,"Millions of people ask for advice for many different things such as relationship and school. Most of the times, they ask for more than one opinion on what they're asking for. Talking to only one person can help others make decisions; however, asking more than one gives more options and is not as optimal.

Seeking for more than one opinion might seem like a drag but overall, it is the best option in certain situations to make choices. Finding more answers to a question that is being asked allows other people's viewpoints to be revealed and thought thoroughly before making the big decision. In most experiences, when people ask for relationship advice, they ask multiple people before making the correct choice; having said that, they get more opinions to be thought about. Asking more than one person lets others know what to do and not to do in the future. It allows them to learn from other's past mistakes and successions. When asking for job advice, people usually give advice on what and not to do based on their past to prepare for the upcoming future. Doing just a little more and seeking further information means taking more time out of the day, but in the end it is worth it.

Looking for only one opinion takes less time out of the day, but it is the lazier option in decision making. Asking only one person for advice means less time and thought involved in choice making. Doing this puts people at risk in taking the wrong choice and being put into a state of regret. Just one opinion does not let civilians know what to do in the future and grow as a person, they will take the hard way out in life. For example, in job interviews, just asking one person for advice means the person is put at risk in failing and is going to learn things in a more difficult fashion and is going to learn what to do based on their own experiences. Taking one piece of advice is the most minimal thing that can be done when asking for advice. Overall, it is just lazy and not worth doing.

Learning from those mistakes others have made lets human beings come together and develop as a person for the future and on. Obtaining a piece of advice from one person is useful but when given more pieces of advice, it is more optimal than when given only a small bit. When tables have turned, those who ask to give advice would be able to grow just as much or maybe even more when others are giving the most advice possible from past situations and asking more than just one person.",0,0.007208788,0,True

Many people have, whether that person is a small toddler deciding if he wants vanilla or chocolate ice cream, or a teenager in high-school deciding on the college he wishes to attend. When people ask for advice, talking to more than one person can help someone make a better choice. You can learn how to make the better choice suitable for you when you talk to other people with more experience and wisdom than yourself. Additionally, more people can give their own ideas and inputs into the said situation, and be able to help you look at the decision to be made in many different ways and perspectives. Thirdly, asking many people what they would do in the same scenario might tell you there might be a clear majority leaning towards one side of the choice. Asking multiple people for advice in a difficult decision can lead someone to make the choice that is best for them.

When come across a difficult decision that you may not have experienced and went through before, there is a high probability that there are other people who have been in the same place. These people will be able to offer their own experience in this decision, the decision they eventually made, and the conclusion they had arrived to. For example, a toddler choosing between ice cream could ask others what ice cream flavor they prefer, and choose the ice cream the majority of people seemed to like. Meanwhile, a teenager deciding on a college could ask adults who have recently graduated from the schools he is choosing between, and question them about their own first-hand experiences in that college. Most of the time, you will not have had enough experience to make a compatible decision yourself, while there might be other people in the world who do, and can help guide you through choosing the better one of your choices.

While trying to make a difficult decision, your point of view of the problem can be limited as you are only one person. However, after asking more people for their own ideas and inputs into the situation, you will be able to look at the decision in a more broader view, and also how it can be made in many different ways. After asking other people what they think about the decision, they will be able to give you their own ideas and thoughts that they have, and the different pros and cons that come along with it. In each difficult decision, one of the elements that make the decision so difficult is the many pros and cons that correspond to each side of the decision. The decision is then comparing which side has the better pros and the least cons. Talking to other people might enable them to see the problem in a different way that you might see it, which can add to your list containing the pros and cons of each side of the decision. Having a more complete list can let you see the problem in a different way, but also guide you into knowing that you have made the better decision after considering all the different aspects of it.

Asking many people what they would in in the same scenario of a difficult decision might also tell you if there is a clear majority leaning towards one choice, which could then tell you if there's a clear choice to be made. Making this choice would make one feel more better and confident in one's self, knowing that there are many other people who agree with making that specific choice. However, if one wishes to use this strategy, they must also make sure that they are asking people who have experience and past knowledge in the decision to be made. A high-schooler who is deciding between two colleges and wishes to ask others on the college he should attend should not ask random strangers walking down the street. Instead, he should ask other gifted students, prestigious educators, or other intelligent adults who might know how to make a better decision than the student himself. However, even after receiving plentiful advice from others, one should know that you are still the person who should take all facts into consideration, and then make the final decision based on your thoughts and ideas.

In conclusion, when people ask for advice, talking to more than one person can help you make the better choice. You can learn how to make the better choice most suitable for yourself when you talk to people who may have more experience and wisdom than you, and more people will be able to give their own ideas and inputs into the situation to help you look at the decision to be made in many different ways and perspectives. Finally, asking many people what they would do in the same scenario tells you if there might be a clear majority leaning towards one choice. Having a clear majority lets you know that this is what most people would do in the same situation, which leads you to feeling more comfortable and confident after making that decision. Though many people have to make difficult decisions throughout their lives, asking more people for advice in this decision will lead them into making the right one for themselves.",0,0.012057527,0,True
CC23A03E8F99,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I have recently been informed that the policy for playing sports has been changed. I for one, am strongly against this. You may want to know why this is a bad idea. Well there are a few reasons. For one as you know, most of the students on the athletic program don't have the newly required academic average that is mandatory to participate. Do you really want to make at least thirty children regret themselves and miss experiencing the only time in their lives where sports is still about fun? TEACHER_NAME, I am aware that this new policy will help make students try harder in school, but athletics can benefit a child as well. Sports help people of all ages achieve a healthy weight and can even help them do better in school, so why would you want to deny this simple activity from a child?

Another reason I believe that this new policy will not benefit this fine school is that students need room to have fun in their lives. Do you remember your childhood, when you would go after school to play some pick-up basketball with friends, practice for a sporting event, or just relax and watch clouds? These are all fun past-times that students perform today. I know that our generation is stereo-typed for being lazy, self-centered, annoying, and dumb. But we are more than that, I guarantee you. Look at some of the great athletes in the world, sure they practiced a lot when they were kids, but they still had fun. Larry Bird and Usian Bolt both described their childhoods as fun times. Athletes are not the only ones that had fun in their childhood. Our current president, Barrack Obama, has had fun in his childhood too. Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, and even Abe Lincoln all had joyous, free times as a kid. And that turned out pretty well for them. I understand that at this point in our lives school is pretty much what we do. It's just expected of us. But please, look beyond that. In a Catholic school, the values you teach us help us throughout our lives. Everyone one of my teachers has told me that they want me to succeed, so if you want us to succeed, let us have some fun.

Also, athletics are a great way to meet new people and build relationships with those people. Social life is important to everyone, and having a large group of friends makes people confident. Students that have friends also, in my opinion, do better in school. Isn't that what you want? Sports are also a way to let out emotions. If I'm feeling angry at my mother, i sometimes go outside and shoot basketball. After about twenty minutes, I feel better. For teens this a great way to spend time and feel better.

Overall I would say that sports is a good activity. it gives positive results and helps us succeed in life. Denying this simple request to repeal the new rule in my eyes is terrible. I know it's up to you, the principal. So I'm begging you. Please let these students participate. I know that this is the right choice. Commitment to excellence, that's what we need. The students would with the lower average would approve of this. I gua",0,0.00752462,0,True
22F3B43D815D,"Everyone at school should and will participate on a school sports team. You may not be the most athletic or social person. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't participate. Because you never know you may find something you really like. Here is why everyone should participate in a school sport.

Some people choose not to participate or try out for a school sport. This is only hurting them. When someone chooses not to participate in a school offered sport such as football, softball, volleyball, or lacrosse. They take a risk of not getting the physical activity they need. If they don't get the exercise they need they may become very unhealthy. They are even also missing out on opportunity's to make new friends.

When students choose not to participate in sports. They may be missing out on some valuable life long friendships. From personal experience I know that if I didn't start playing softball I wouldn't have some of the friendships and memories I have today. With the people I have become friends with i'm sure that we will stay friends, through high school and even college as we grow throughout softball careers together. So if you think you aren't good enough still tryout because you never know you could make friendships that last a lifetime.

School sports are again a good idea for everyone. Parents may think that it is not a good idea to play sports because it is dangerous. Even though they think this kids will have fun and make memories. Parents also might say ""not every single kid wants to play sports!"" That may be true but another sport they can play if they don't enjoy high contact, fast pace sports is competitive chess. Or they could make a new club where they can incorporate stuff they like and make up a new sport. That they would enjoy more than the other sports.

With the options an evidence given, it is a good idea to play sports. Because, it makes kids more physically active, creates new friendships, and allows kids to have the fun they can't have during class. A principal should make kids play sports because it can be fun and educational at the same time. And lastly it teaches them how to be good people and shows them valuable life skills and lessons.  ",0,0.0079094395,0,True
AFE9B6AA1365,"I am against the development of these cars. The reasons i am against it is because for one, why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver ? like they mentioned in paragraph 8.

I feel like thats doing to much , if your going to invent a ""driverless car"" make it so that it can do everything by its self without the owners help, so that way the human can relax while the car does all the work.

For two, if the owner has to still do work and take over at certain times and certain parts whats the point?, you might as well just get a car you can control fully (a normal car) not a car that controls half the stuff you could be controling while you still have to conrtol certain parts/things.

What about new beginners that are just now learning how to drive ?, they need to know how to work/control the whole car NOT certain parts, what if they end up banning these ""driverless cars"" because its to many accidents and new beginners only know how to control certain parts because they were so used to the ""driverless cars"" that controlled most of the things in the car they arent used to the normal cars.

I honestly feel like they should just stick with normal cars and let the owners do all the work.

The owners are the ones paying for the car so why not let them control the car i could see if they werent making payments and stuff on the car and all they had to do was pay for it and its all theirs but their still going to have to make payments so why not let them control it themselves ?. What about if there is an accident the car shouldnt have to warn them anything, if the owner was paying attention to the road like your supposed to you would know if its an accident or if its about to be an accident. if someone is hurt who would be at fault the driver or manufacturer? i feel like it would be the manufacturer fault because their the ones that make these ""driverless cars"" thats supposed to do mostly everything and thats supposed to warn the driver when something bad happens.

What if the car makes a mistake and dont warn the driver ? , they should make it safe and confortable if thats the case because their the ones making these cars not the owner. It would honestly only be the drivers fault if they were the ones controling the whole car and all the parts because if they werent paying attention to the road and they controlled the car and an accident occurs then its 100% the drivers fault for not paying attention to the road like todays car , they wouldnt sue the manufacturer they really wouldnt even do anything because its the owners fault.

As a result 70 percent of the families ther don't own cars. This new trend is predicted to cut down greenhouse gasses in suburbs and cities, for which cars are resposible. ""Automobiles are the linchpin of of suburbs.... And that, experts say, is a huge impedement to current efforts to drastically reduce gas emissions form tailpipes.... Passanger cars are responsible for 12 percent of... gas emissions in Europe... and some 50 percent in... the United States.""(In German Suburbs Life Goes on Without Cars by Elizabeth Rosenthal p. 5)

In the Colombian city of Bogota millions of city dwellers hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work on a special day called The Day Without Cars. The citizens agree it is a fruitful endeavor, that lowers pollution, releives stress, and provides a great opportunity to excersize. It even set a trend for two other cities who, for the first time since the event started three years ago, joined in the special day. ""These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,"" said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asuncion, Paraguay. (Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky p.26)

While cars still have their uses, it seems like they are slowly becoming a fading fad. People around the world are embracing a life without cars, and trying to put a dent in the world's pollution. Who knows, if Americans embrace it, there might be an end to the obesity epidemic.    ",0,0.007417401,0,True

658428760D94,"Online and video conferencing learning is becoming more popular in school systems throughout the country. Some schools offer distance learning as an option to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. While many students would love to stay at home and complete their school work, it could easily lead to many problems that could be prevented. Students would not have the ability to make friends or interact with other students face-to-face. Some students might prefer a classroom environment to help with the abilities to learn better. Online or video conferencing classes could lead the students to become less motivated or lazy. Ultimately, I disagree that students would benefit from being able to take classes from home.

Many students like to attend school because they get to see their friends and interact with new people. Having online classes as an option would take this away from students. Students would take advantage of staying home and completing their work. For example, students would have the ability to talk to their friends online but not actually talk in person and have an actual conversation with them. This could lead to losing friendships and even ruining their social skills for later in life. Therefore, students would not have the opportunity to meet new people or interact with their friends if they were taking online classes.

Other students would rather have a classroom setting than an online computer based setting. Students tend to learn better when they are in a classroom environment and can interact with a teacher. For example, if a student needed help with an assignment in a classroom, the teacher would be present and ready to assist them. If the student was taking an online course, it could take longer for the teacher to response or become available online. Having an online classroom setting could lead the student to not do well in the class or even cheat to get the assignment finished. Therefore, having a classroom environment with a teacher would be more beneficial for the student rather than an online environment.

Opponents argue that online or video conferencing learning would be beneficial to students more than learning in a classroom. For example, students would be able to work at their own pace in the class and do the amount of work they wanted to do that day. This would allow the students to be less stressed and more relaxed when learning. However, these online or video conferencing classes could lead the students to become lazy or less motivated to do anything. Becoming lazy or less motivated could result in assignments being turned in late, putting off every assignment due until last minute, or not even completing the assignments at all. Doing this would result in the student becoming behind or even failing the class. Therefore, students would not benefit from taking online classes due to the possibility of becoming lazy or unmotivated.

Online and video conferencing classes would not be beneficial for students. Taking classes at home comes with many problems. Students could lose friends they have had for a long time or their social skills could decline. The students would not have the ability to take the classes in a classroom setting and have a teacher present during the class. Some students may even become lazy or unmotivated to complete these courses and the assignments with them. In closing, students would benefit more from being at a school taking the classes than having the classes offered online at home. ",0,0.0074167377,0,True

I beleive that we should get rid of the electoral college. It is unfair to many voters. Because of the winner tak-all system in each state candidats dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focsing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. During the 2000 campaign seventeen states did not seee the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Caronlina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markes did not see a single campaign ad. we should also get rid of the electoral college because of the electoral college they lost 60 percent of the voters who would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.

The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidtate receives  majority of the votes casted. For example Nixon in 1968 and cliton in 1992 both had only a 43percent purality of the popular votes, While winning a majority in the Electoral College 301 and 370 ecetoral votes, there is pressure for run-off when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast.

But back to electoral college votes being unfair a lot of the states like  wyoming north and south dakota knowing they only get three votes that count some people dont even bother voting, I mean I would not want to if i knew that my vote really was not going to make a diffrence.

so yes electoral college votes are good like how obama recived 61.7 percents of the votes out of the 51.3 percents that Romney got, because all states award the winner take-all system. But I think that we should go back to a direct election to make the voting fare to evryone to keep everyone voting and make them feel like we are still one country.         ",0,0.00782442,0,True

It is important that kids help, it's not so hard to give up one hour of your day to help the community. If we start with the little things we can make a difference and do something bigger and better.

I strongly believe that, failure plays a huge role in pursuing success, and I have a personal story and also information to back up my statement ""that failing is the key to success"".

The news article of daily life, had a section dedicated to failing is a key to success, in that portion it talks about how the most successful people in the world had to fail so many times and hardship in that portion of the article it interviews Bill Gates and he quote on quote said that ""failing thought me that you have to try harder and harder every time you fail in order to successed"", and without failing he would not be the CEO of Google.

I personally have experienced how failing is the key to success. I started playing football in my freshman year in high school. I was trying so hard to get a starting position on the football team. I was doing really bad during team practice, and one day my coach came up to me and told me that I should quit football, and how it was not the right sport for me. So I got cut from the team but I did not listen to what my coach said to me. I kept practicing over the off season working harder then ever. When sophomore season came up and we had to go through tryouts in order to make the team. I was doing really good in the first two days of the tryouts but then I started doing really bad on the third day, and then the coach came up to me on the last day of the tryouts, and told me that I did not make the team. I started feeling really hopeless but I still did not gave up and kept working harder and harder. On my junior season it was time for the football tryouts once again. I started doing really good, and the coaches were really impressed of what I was capable of doing. Last day of the tryouts the coach came up to me, and told me that he was really proud of me. He was really surprised that I didnt gave up, and after that he told me I made the team as a starting defensive tackle.

In conclusion this is why I strongly agree that failing is a key to success, without failure we as human beings would not be able to improve in our day to day life. It is because of failing which keeps us successful, and makes us humans work harder for what we want in life.

Dear Principal,

Throughout the United States of America, pollution, homeless people, and many more everyday conflicts that can be modified and diminished are faced in nearly every city and town. If there is a way to reconstruct the society of our country, then why not do it? Well is would be an outstanding achievement, but it would require a lot of time and work. Therefore, it would cut time from sports, education, music, and spending time with friends and family. In this case I believe that students should not be forced into community service to help make our nation a better place.

To start this idea off, many students are already lugging themselves to help form a better civilization. The United States is not a catastrophe, and many other countries have corrupt governments and humans living on streets and in their cars. I believe that the nation's idea of setting up homes for our citizens is already an enhancement for our magnificent nation. Many adults rather are looking for jobs in our nation. Perhaps, if adults were payed for their labor, it would increase employment rate and make our kingdom a better place to live.

Students who are willing to perform in community services should definitely have the privileges to do as they wish. For example, I play tennis three to four times a week, play golf, play the piano, the drums, and know French. I perform these activities, not only for my pleasure, but also to make a nice beginning for my near future. I also am a member of the California Junior Scholarship Federation. I help our society in dealing with people in need, cleaning up our environment, and much more. If I were to take some time off from my activities and put time into helping our community, it would make this world a better place, but it would also clip the ends off of my goals.

All in all, they are definitely many conflicts that people in America face daily, but once again, other areas in our world face conflicts that are mush major. To my opinion, students should not be forced to do community service.",0,0.0072152168,0,True
066B1D7C9214,"I think many students can benefit from online schooling. Online options at schools can assure every student gets an equal education no matter the circumstances. Students who are too sick or have important responsibilities at home would greatly benefit from the program. As well as students who want to attend a certain school or college but cant because of the distance in between the school and them. A great abundance or students would benefit from online schooling by being able to get an education even if health, responsibilities, or distance is an issue.

Having the option of online schooling would really make a difference in many students education. Whether it be the student is too sick to attend class or even if the student wants to remain home to prevent getting sick. I can directly relate this to the coronavirus epidemic thats unfolding across the US as well as across the globe. Many students have not been able to or are too afraid to attend school on behalf on contracting the virus. Online schooling would allow those students to continue their education from the safety of their own home.

Another reason online schooling would be greatly beneficial is it would give people who cant be out as much the opportunity to learn. Everyone has busy lives, some busier than others, so busy they dont have time to do many things like attend school and get an education. But online schooling programs would change that. For example my Grandma had a very tough childhood. She did not have the luxury of attending school, instead she had to work every weekday to help her parents and little brother financially. She never had the option to attend school, but with the new online schooling programs she would have been able to work as well as get an education from her own home.

Lastly online schooling could drastically help break down the distance border when attending school. Distance has always been an issue in education for not only my family but many others as well. students want to be able to attend certain schools and universities but are either to shy and scared to leave the life theyve created behind or simply cannot afford the travel expenses back and forth from school/ universities to their home town. In my life for example, moving around and being thrown into a new scene causes a lot of stress and anxiety but with the online schooling option, i, as well as many other students, would have the choice to attend our dream schools, with out bringing along unneeded stress and anxiety.

In conclusion, i think online schooling programs would be greatly beneficial for students and teachers. It helps ensure that sick students, students with at-home responsibilities, and students who cant go the distance get an education.

I think that all students should to community service , because it'll help us be more responsible , caring , and it'll make the place we help a better place to be . Some people may think it takes out to much time but really it doesn't , the community service can be during school hours , or on your weekend while doing the things you normally do , lets say your going out with your friends to the park , you can clean up some litter on the floor , maybe help the kids around you , take pictures for proof and that's all that needs to be done . Its not something hard to do and in the end it benefits you and the area around you , so technically its a win , win situation . Maybe to get more kids to do it is by for all the community service they do it will give them extra credit in some of there classes and maybe a little prize for them in the end of the year , now i bet all the kids will be willing to do community service . If some of the kids are still a little more stubborn they can still do community service but just not so much time , just a couple hours , hey it better then nothing right ?

Anyways community service can be a fun experience think about it helping out at your old elementry school visiting your old teachers , remebering when you were there just younger , seeing old pictures of you there , making new friends even if they may be younger .

I understand that you are considering making all students here at SCHOOL_NAME do community service. Community service is a great thing, but it shouldn't be forced upon students. I think it's better to try and convince students to perform more community service, so they do it willingly and have fun doing it. I have come up with a plan to help you do this.

Students are interested in many things, like music and sports, but they are much more interested in having fun. I believe that students see community service as boring, which is why they do not want to perform any community service tasks. If you can convince students that helping out in the community can be fun, they will definitely be more willing go out and volunteer their time and hard work. Students want to be with friends as much as they can. If one student wants to go clean up the park with the city council, they are sure to invite their best friend. Their friend will want to help because they're best friend is helping. They see it as more fun because they will be with someone they know. If we try a technique like this, the outcome can be great. If we create a group, here at school, of students who like to volunteer, we can definitely convince more students to help out of lovely city. Students will convince their friends to join, and quickly, we will have a large group of students that want to help. We can organize our own school volunteer work, or we can team up with the city council and work with them on city wide projects and events.

Students are usually only open to new things and experiences, when their friends are involved with them. If students learn that volunteering is fun, they will grow up and have this same mentality. They will have the chance to open themselves up to a new experience they are sure to love! Who knows, maybe one day they'll grow up to change the world!

Just overall help people that are struggling because peope will follow your step by seeing you do it. If you see a old lady go help her bring the stuff to her car or ask her do you need any help if she say yes then help her and if she say no then shes fine but atleast you ask because some people are watching who is helping or not.

94B72A7C1E6B,"Dear State Senator,

Ever since our founding fathers established in the constitution that the president and vice president votes were determined by electoral college, the founding fathers made a good decision. Electoral College is a process where electors gather for a meeting and count the electoral votes to determine the new president and vice president. The United States should keep Electoral College to determine the president and vice president rather than a popular vote because Electoral College avoids run-off elections, and Electoral College is more fair than a popular vote.

To start off, Electoral College should continue to determine the president and vice president voting rather than popular votes because electoral college avoids run-off elections. If somebody was running for either president or vice president and they recieved thirty percent in popular votes, nobody would know if the person with thirty percent popular vote would win the election. Electoral College prevents confusion by producing a clear winner. For example, in source 3, the text reads ""Richard Nixon in 1968 and Bill Clinton in 1992 had only forty-three percent of popular votes but both had three-hundred and plus electoral votes which made them win the election"". The president and vice president make sure our country is running well and that we as a country have no problems. If we were to determine our president and vice president by a popular vote, whoever could kiss up more to the voters would win the election even if the person running doesn't meet up to the qualifacations of the person they are running against. Avoiding a run-off election is very important because no canidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. Also, if a popular vote was how the president and vice president were decided, not as much people would pay attention to voting because voters have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign of the people running for president and vice president.

Furthermore, Electoral College should continue to determine the president and vice president voting rather than a popular vote because Electoral College is more fair than a popular vote. In 2008 when Barack Obama won his election to become the 44th president of the United States, he didn't win by being the popular canadite, Obama won by his passion to make this country better than it already is. For example, in source 1, the text reads ""The electoral college consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electorial votes is required to elect the president"". That way of electing the president is more fair than a popular vote because you need 270 electors to say yes to make you president rather than people making you president by if your popular or not. Electoral College is what keeps our elections fair. There is no other way to elect somebody president becuase no other method will be this successful than Electoral College. After all, Electoral College has been the way to elect the president since the constitution was created. Popular Voting is a bad method if were used to determine the president and vice president because somebody who is running for president can manipulate people to think he or she is a good canidate for president when they really aren't.

To conclude, Electoral College should continue to decide the president rather than popular votes becuase Electoral College avoids run-off elections, and Electoral College is more fair than popular votes. Why should we change the way we elect president if this method has been working for over 200 years? Electoral College should continue to decide the presidency for years to come because it works so well. That's why Electoral College will stay as the way to elect the president.

I understand that you want to raise the standard for playing sports and other activities so that each student involved needs to maintain a B average to participate. I think this is a good idea because it will motivate students to keep their grades up, and still get to do the activities they want. As I am not involved in sports, I'm not sure my opinion will be most valid. However, I do know that, for a fact, some students will not like this new rule.

They may say they feel more pressured, and some parents might even get into the argument, both on the pro and con side.

On the contrary, I personally think it's a good idea to get up, and keep up, students grades. Some will be upset about it, but will thank you later for making sure that they keep up their GPA while still letting them do extra activities.

One obstacle you may or may not have to face when making this decision is the parents of students. Because you don't have every student's background knowledge, you wont know how the families of these students will react. For example, there might be parents of students who want their child to focus on sports, and sports only. That might be kind of hard to do when they are staying up until midnight to complete assignments to maintain their B average. Several families will get upset at this.

However, A school meeting could be held with the parents and families who both agree and disagree. I think it's a good idea to start this rule that will apply to most, but I think some exceptions can be made for other select students in other personal situations.

That doesn't mean that for those select few, they can goof off and still participate in sports and activities, it just means that for some of them, maintaining the traditional C average may be best.

FAF91DDF582C,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to guarantee that students will continue to learn during their summer break. It is essential that students keep learning even though they are taking a break from school, but these summer projects should be teacher-designed. Why should a students not be allowed to choose a project of their liking? Well, the student's teacher will know what that person needs to work on. If a student were to choose what they would like their project to be about, they could probably decide to work on something that does not require much effort; therefore, it would be best if a professional particularly assigned a certain topic to help his or her pupil designated to help them grow and become more efficient in their academic life. However, if the student believes that there is a specific topic they believe they need to practice more than the teacher should consider to make an exemption.

Students would certainly benefit if they were given homework over summer. This action would ensure that the student will be ready to tackle classroom assignments once they are back to school. Not only that but it would also let the student perfect their skills and be prepared in class. These projects designated to students will surely boost the alumni's knowledge and confidence on that specific topic. Therefore, the student will not struggle as much as they would have without the extra help.

In addition, if teachers assign students particular homework designed to help their alumni be more efficient in class, it is undeniable that their student's classroom performance will have a positive effect in their academic life. The teacher ,being a professional, will have more understanding of what their student needs to work on. He or she can personalize the project to better help the student understand and learn about their assignment. The extra help given to the alumni will have positive results and they could use their knowledge acquired by the project on other classes, or these young adults can use this information outside of school to help them handle outside of school life situations. If trained professionals give students homework during summer break, then those students will be able to see how this extra work helped them master skills when school opens again.

Students should not be given the privilege to choose their own project assignments. Some students would pick easy topics that would not require them to put much effort, this will deeply harm the student academically. Instead of working hard to perfect an area in which the student struggles, they would rather choose something that is easy and would get done quickly. This is why it is better if teachers gave students their assignments. However, it can not be guaranteed that the students will learn or understand the homework assignment. For that reason could be that maybe the student is not ready to take on that particular topic. Without a doubt, it is known that not all students learn the same way and not all understand what they have learned. Everybody learns at their own pace and in their own way. If the student believes that the designated work is too hard, or maybe too easy, then they should talk to their teacher and suggest a different topic. Also, if the students thinks that there is another area they need to practice more, they should ask their teacher to consider their request.

Schools that require students to continue learning during the summer will see positive results in students academic lives. Designated work from teachers will greatly help alumni master and perfect classroom skills. Not to mention, students will acquire more knowledge on these areas with the extra help that was provided. If the teacher knows what their students need to work more on, those students will soon be ready to take on anything once school is in cession again. If students were given the liberty to pick their projects, would the students actually learn from it? What happens if the student chooses an easy project, when they could have been working on some other topic that they know they have trouble with? This will certainly not be a good idea. As professionals, teachers know what is best for their students if they have been observing their classroom performance. However, Many teachers sometimes overlook a few things in which student have trouble with. When this happens the student should take a step forward and let their teacher know what it is they think they need to work. This way the teacher can look back and verify is this person does need to practice more in the areas that they may be struggling.",0,0.0073260097,0,True
B6B1ADD3EC37,"examples of advice

Asking for advice is a way of getting through daily struggles and one of the ways asking for advice is opinions. so you are having trouble with a friendship and you want to make things better you ask friends,family,etc you are still getting more than one opinion. when you are having conflict and you ask one of your friends and he says throw them off a bridge just go to someone else and ask them what the right thing to do a second opinion does not hurt it saved your friends life.

Back in july i had a math test due and i was asking my friend if i should study or not and she was like no you are fine you will pass it and it is really easy. so i took the test and failed so 3 ,weeks later i have a quiz i ask the same friend what should i do she says the same thing so i asked my besfriend he says yes you should really study it will help alot so i studied and passed. I also think that getting more than one opinion is like having a bigger brain and you are looking at it diffrently becuase you have more ideas on the question or the advice you needed.

Making a better choice from more than one opinion i think is gonna be more of a chance you do the right thing. Example what should i do to get more money friend 1 rob a bank friend 2 ask or beg for money friend 3 get an education and get a job. friend one could have got you killed friend 2 wasnt so bad but you should never beg or ask for money unless you have a job and need finacial help friend 3 will help you in long run so always get multiple opinions on any kind of advice. construction workers always have multiple opinions on a build they are doing so do house designers it's a good way of doing something better for yourself and others.

My advice to you is to ask more than one person expesically if it is important i will always get more than one opinion but not on everything. But it does give you more than one thing to choose from if thats to difficult narrow it down to the one you want and like the most. Another example is what would you like for your birthday not just one person is going to know what might interest and excite you.         ",0,0.0076478533,0,True
48A79347EF59,"Summer assignments are never fun and many students can agree with that statement. Even though they are beneficial to continue your learning throughout your break. Summer assignments should be designed by the teachers of the course due to the fact that they are familiar with the curriculum, they understand what is needed to be tested on throughout the course, and the teacher knows what the students are capable of doing.

Teachers are familiar with the curriculum and know what needs to be on your assignment to ensure that you are successful in the class. The teachers have learned that topic and are experts on the subject. Going to a college and receiving a higher education in a certain topic makes the professor best fit to decide what you should learn during your break off from school. For example in a AP Human Geography class the summer assignment was to fill in maps of the world and fill out chapter guides for the first two units. In doing this the students became familiar with the content which makes them more likely to receive a higher grade and a better understanding of the unit. This proves that when the teacher designs the assignment they are leading you to become more familiar and successful in your learning.

Teachers know what is being tested in a course and what is expected for the student to know. Teachers have to teach certain things to the students while following a guideline. This tells the teacher what the student should know by the end of the year. By giving the students a summer assignment that lets them be ahead and know certain topic then it benefits the students and makes them receive a better understanding of the curriculum. In most courses there are online resources that allow the teacher to know what should be taught by the end of the year and what should be taught in a certain state. This helps the teacher decide what the summer assignments should be. Some students may think that a student-designed assignment would be easier and more beneficial. This is incorrect due to the fact that the students aren't familiar with the subject or what needs to be taught. The students also aren't responsible enough to decide what needs to be learned over their break.

Teacher understand the students position since they were all in the same place at a certain point in time, therefore they will assign what they know the student is capable of doing without overwhelming them. The teacher will give the student a doable amount of work that will benefit them without stressing and overwhelming them. A teacher that taught AP Human Geo at a high school understood that students wanted a break from school and they didn't want to do useless work that wouldn't help them. Therefore he gave them a good amount of work that they could finish and learn from.

Summer assignments should be teacher-designed due to the fact that teachers understand the students and understand the curriculum so they can balance an assignment that benefits the students. Teachers are more familiar with the subject and know what the students will be tested on, therefore the assignments will have a good purpose. Teachers should make the assignments because they are experts on the topics and have the students interests at heart so they can help them.",0,0.0067699817,0,True

Most people today drive thier cars to get from one location to another, but most do not think about what it actually does to the environment. Most cars run on a form of Diesel fuel which release carbon emissions and other greenhouse gasses which are harmful towards the environment. Passenger cars in Europe are responsible for around 12% of the greenhouse gasses there. And in most car intensive areas in the United States up to 50% of greenhouse gas emissions is released. For a day in France car usage was banned to reduce the amount of smog in the area. After 5 days of intensifying smog the amount of car traffic was reduced by 60%. another great reason for reducing the usage of cars is that it causes less stress towards people and yourself. And it greatly reduces traffic for other cars. in Bogota, once a year they have a day without cars which is part of an improvement campaign that began in the mid-1990s. Since then it has seen the construction of 118 miles of bike paths, sports centers, and multiple parks. Some people prefer biking than driving which i salso a good way to get fit.

This is a serious cause to many people but for some reason many of those students have a grade C average but you must have a grade B average to participate in sports or other activities. In this reasonable letter I will be supporting my argument with specific reasons. Feel welcome to not accept my reasonings but i assure you that it will be better to let C students be eligible for playing sports.

My number top one reason is that the school will lose popularity do to the fact that students will transfer out to another school in search of a school that accept C students in sports and other activities. The school will lose money but not that much but yeah they will have no more basketball games or any other sport that requires an entrance fee. So I really think that you should consider the policy before you make it official. Another reason to let these students get in sports is that a C is a passing criteria grade point average score. Another reason is that it will help the students out of gang and drug participation, instead they would be in school training or participating in a school activity.

So please TEACHER_NAME help the school by accepting C students into sports. It would save you a lot of F students and trouble with the school.

You change the world, and you have to be sure what you want and what you do not want, you have to be yourself, you can be different, the different it is not bad, because sometimes ""Be like others is do not be no one"".

For those reasons is why you have to be yourself, you have to follow your dreams and you have to fight for them, don't let the people throw you, and if you felt, you have to get up and keep fighting for your dreams.

The facial action coding system is not totaly offical. In the story it says that it uses you face to tell what going on or something. They say that they can tell if it is a real smile or a fake one by your muscules.

D0C00F3D38E3,"Do you really believe that all kids should do an extracurricular activity after school? Well, I do and so does the principal at my school. Also, an extracurricular activity dosen't always have to be a sport. It can be working on the yearbook, joining different clubs, or it could be a sport. I agree with this decision because it gets children more active, helps them communicate with other students, and just to do something instead of being at home.

Firstly, the decision makes children more active by doing things to keep them moving. There are different activities in the sports catergory to keep children moving and active. The activites consist of cheer,soccer, baseball, softball. tennis, etc. There are also inside activites such as volleyball, swim team, and basketball. Those were some examples of activites you could do to get kids active.

Furthermore, this decision helps children communiate with other students. Normally, children are shy when they meet other kids, but joining different activites throughout the years wouldnt be so hard to talk to other students. Kids often don't talk when joining new activites beacuse of the lack of communication or the lack of knowing the other students. I know this from experience. Joining extracurricular activites will help with communication around the school.

Lastly, students should just want to do something instead of being at home. I wouldn't like to be at home all day knowing I could be at home all day knowing I could be doing something fun at school. Most kids like to stay home and be bored, but little do they know, they could be in different types of activites after school. I also do activites after school, because i don't wan't to be at home doing nothing. Students doesn't like to stay at home anyway.

The decision of making all kids do activites is agreeable. They should be more active, communicate with more students, and should want to do something instead of being home. I believe that if all students at my school do extracurricular activites that the school would be a little but more fun. The students at the school would be more into ging to school.          ",0,0.006834803,0,True
BF1212223916,"I disagree with the decision that all students must participate in an extra curricular activity. Maybe the reason that some students don't actively participate in those activities is because they have conflicts or cannot afford to participate. However it is good for a student to get activity in a day or do something fun with their brains. Students playing sports or being in clubs is good but not all kids have the luxury to be involved with those things.

Here are the three reasons why I think that students should not be forced to participate in an after school activity. One, some students may have serious conflicts that prevent them from doing an activity, such as taking care of relatives and siblings. Two, some students may not be able to afford being on the team and paying for jerseys or not be able to purchase a camera for yearbook club. Three, some students just may not want to do it. Maybe they would rather just go home and draw or do something by themselves, and not with other people.

However there are two benefits from making this rule. One, making students participate in an extra curricular activity could introduce the kids to something new, that they might really enjoy. Two, participating in one of these activities such as sports or a club helps activate different parts of their brain which they probably wouldn't get in school.

I think that the principal could also make it so if a student had a good enough reason that they couldn't or didn't want to partake in an activity then they wouldn't have to. And if a student really wanted to do something but had a conflict, then the principal could try and make time for them.

In conclusion I disagree with the decision to make students participate in an activity. If they couldn't then they can't and the principal can't really do anything about that. And if a student didn't want to then they shouldn't be forced into something they don't want to do. Even though there are a few benefits, I still think that it would be better if this was not a rule.",0,0.007377954,0,True
F3CB6601CF24,"I was stuck in between two decisions, live with my mom or live with my dad. I could ask for help, but would it make a difference if I didn't feel happy about it? Asking friends could lead to fights, and if I asked parents and step parents they would probably make it some emotional lesson. I decided to ask my uncle, Generic_Name, who could relate to me on many occasions. He said that it was up to me but he thought I would be happier at my dads house. It wasn't enough only being one person, so I went to my aunt, Generic_Name, who said my mom needed me more. I needed tie breaker. My last resort was my brother, Generic_Name. Although he was not close to me at all, he was honest with me and said that I should stay with my dad. He said that if I wanted to be mentally stable and not have my clothes carry the stench of smoke form cigarettes, dad was the right option.

They weren't all the same option but it was easier than me and one other person deciding. Because I got more than one persons opinion, I went down the right path.

I think asking advice from more than one person and seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.

Making a decision by yourself or with only one other person's opinion, can be damaging to the mind. If you are trying to make a decision and make a right choice, you are most likely always thinking about it. It always being on your mind leads to distress and you just made a one track mind. Your mind is not meant to only think of one subject, it needs to constantly be running with new ideas and thoughts. Your creativity relies on parts of your brain. You will, literally, go brain dead. School takes on a lot of thinking, but we have multiple subjects. Having multiple subjects means that your mind is switching between them and not on just one. You are supposed to challenge your brain, and you are supposed to let it win, not defeat it.

Another reason you should get more than one persons opinion is that the one person you choose could be manipulating you. If you ask for their opinion and they can see physically that your stressed, they will take advantage of that. They will take advantage of you by choosing the decision they want and not think of you. They have the high ground over you and you are willing to stay down.

It will benefit them, but have no effect, positive or negative, on you. It does not matter if your the one who brought it up, they are the stronger one because you are controlling your own mind into thinking that's okay. You can't fool your bodies actions but you can fool your mind into what ever you want it to be.

The last reason you should get more people's opinions is that you have someone to talk to. When you are in the decision making mindset, you are not aware of your surroundings. You are being held down by the stress that is being a burden to you. Your brain is feeling heavy and you are feeling wary. When you sit down with someone, you can set the burden down. You now are in the mindset of getting help from people. They will share their opinions, and then you move on to another. You don't even have to know that person, and the problem does't even have to be that big. Listening to their own opinions can help your own. Visually, physically, listening, you can find anyone's opinion.

Those are some of my reasons why getting opinions from other people can help someone make a better choice. People think that using your brain for a one act thing is okay. It's damaging to your thoughts and to your creativity. Once you get into the one set mind, it's very difficult to get out of it. People manipulating you is also not okay. You have the question, you ask it, you control it. Don't let anyone else control it. And lastly, talking to someone is essential to make the best decision. Why have all that stress on your back while you can just take it off. You have control over your brain, so don't ruin it.               ",0,0.0072930017,0,True
6DA56FC5AEFD,"Dear Senator,

The electoral college has existed for many years till now and has been used to elect the presidents of the United States of America, clearly this form of electing a president is outdated. Senator, You must change the electoral college and replace it with popular vote because the electoral college is unfair, and irrational.

Senator you must change the electoral college and replace it with popular vote because it is unfair. This is true because under the elecoral college system voters vote not for the president but for a state senator who in turn elects the president. For example a person living in Texas that wanted to vote for John Kerry would have to vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the off-chance that those elctors won the statewide election, they would go to congress and Kerry would then recieve his 34 electoral votes. Because of this system voters cant control who the electors vote for, and sometimes voters get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate. The electoral college isnt only unfair to the voters but also to the men and women who are competing in the elections, for example in the 2000 U.S presidential race Al Gore recieved more individual votes than George W. Bush nationwide, but Bush won the election, recieving 271 electoral votes to Gores 266 electoral votes. This is why you must replace the electoral college Mr. Senator.

At the most basic level, the electoral college is irrational to voters. Because of the winner take all system in each state candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on swing states. Seventeen states didnt see the candadates at all, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didnt get to see a single campaing add. the electoral college is irrational because given that many voters vote one party for president and another for congress, the house of representatives can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people, and if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this senator in 1968 a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election, in 1976 a tie would have occured if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from a catastrophie. This is why you must replace the electoral college due to its irrationalism.

Its quite clear State senator, the electoral college is unfair and irrational, the best arguements in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. and the arguements against direct elections are spurious at best. This is why you must abolish the electoral college.

A817A13D651B,"Dear Principal TEACHER_NAME,

As you know, you are changing the school policy to students needing at least a B average to participate in school sports or activities. What you may not know is many students here have a C average.

A C average is not bad at all! It's actually the average scored of an A-F grade scoring. So many students do an expected ""good job"" on their grades. It is sometimes hard, or very hard for students to raise one grade level, especially since the school year is half way over, the sports and activities are winding down leaving no time to do so.

In addition, our middle school is very small, so we need all the people we can get on our sports team or activities. Making the cut-off a C average will cut off half of the participants from joining and already on a team or in a school activity!

This will create a difficult problem for coaches, and club leaders to have a small population on their team or in their club.

I have a friend who actually has a C average and is hoping to make the track team for the 3rd year in a row. She is also hoping that high school coaches watch her track meets to get on a team in high school, or even her favorite high school Springstead! If you change the rule she will not be able to participate in her favorite sport, or get into a further more educational and athletic school than her zoned high school Central, averaging a D grade level. Changing this rule can change someone's life.

2A7755E94148,"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" writes about about the many problems us humans have with exploring venus. But he also throws in there reasons why we should support the studying of Venus, and I agree with them on it and here's why.

First we need to out what claims the author made that support the idea of exploring and studying Venus. Firstly, the author points out that long ago Venus was most likely like Earth in the fact that it probably had water and lifeforms on it's surface. And they also point out that Venus is the closet option for a planetary visit. Here's my problem with the authors claims, and that is that they have no hard proof or that they don't go into detail. For example, the author theorizes that there were lifeforms and water on venus, but we have no proof for either of those statements. The author also claims that the value of returning to venus is indisputable even though the problems with returning outnumber the benefits.

I believe that we should look into returning to Venus, however I don't believe that it's a high priority mission or goal that we need to accomplish, because of the problems we are currently facing on our own planet.",0,0.007089067,0,True

Many people in the society are taking several changes in the life of them, this will be a form to improve their goals in the future, some people thinking that made changes might be completely complicated for many reasons that they cannot do this, sometimes would be for some issues that we have. Also, each one we have different purposes but anything is impossible in this world made some changes that even more will be like a window with many opportunity. Opportunely sometimes we don't take the worst to start made certains changes that this will be big chances. In my own opinion this might be to begin a new style of life with the propose to change and improve my goals that will be the beginning of new opportunnity increase my ability to achieve my dreams that I have in my mind, open me in the future with new goals in the mind and never give up till that my dreams can be successful.

There is just not enough people out there that are joining this organization and we need all the people that we can get. All of us people put together into a group that cared and did everything for everyone that they could would turn us all into heros.

UNRRA, stands for the, ( United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration), UNRRA hires people called, ""Seagoing Cowboys"". Seagoing cowboys are people who go on cattle-boat trips to usually far away places. These cattle-boats carry things such as, cows, horses, and other farm animals. Sometimes these boats also carry medical stuff so that the people that go to the other side have stuff that they can help to cure the wounded with. For example during the, Pacific war, seagoing cowboy's were sent over seas to go and be carers for the men and women in which were wounded in battle.

Imagine all the people that are out there fighting for your country while you enjoy the peace in your nice quiet humble home while the people that are out there get to sleep on the ground if they even get to sleep. What if the people that are fighting for you run out of food what if they run out of horses to carry them across the battlefields so if in a case where they almost die they might very well be able to get away with quick speed.

871F8C827F11,"People always say that the future of technology is here. The cartoons of rockets blasting off into space have become a reality allowing astronauts to walk on the moon. Cell phones allow users to call, message, and interact with others from relatively anywhere. Cars have been designed to reach speeds well over one-hundred miles-per-hour. In the article, ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" the author presents postive aspects of driveless cars to demostrate reasons why support for the development of autonomous vehicles is needed.

Autonomous cars are a breakthough technology, and just like any other new invention, there is a demand for improvement. The development of these driverless cars will make the lives of the passenger easier, will make roads safer, and make road trips enjoyable. Cars are expected to be, ""capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time."" This ability for these machines to run on their own will mean less work for the person sitting in the drivers seat. Of course, anyone in these cars will have to be alert enough to take over whenever something unusual is happening on the road, but that is minimal compared to the work of actually driving. A major part of these vehicles is the, ""LIDAR, it uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings."" This sensor, which is placed on the roof, is alert at all times and can take in information of any 3-D object in a cars surrounding area for a relief of a sense of danger. These cars, ""allowing far better response and control than a human driver,"" are making the roads safer. The sensors and technology in these cars and so fast to act because of their programming that a human could not manage to keep up. Manufacturers are working on ""bringing in-car entertainment"" which will make the experience in one of these driverless cars even more enjoyable. The vehicle is coded to alert the driver and shut off all entertainment systems when it is in a position in which the driver must regain control. This feature is safer to the driver because when someone is looking at their phon, they are not paying attention to the road, but in an autonomous vehicle there is always someone or something in attention.

Support for the development of autonomous vehicle is needed to change the future of driving. The workload of the dirver for a roadtrip in minimized to a point where they are in control a very small percentage of the time. Roads become safer due to the sensors and code in the cars which allow them to react faster than humans. Just as importantly, road trips will now be enjoyable to passangers with the entertainment that can be provided when not having your own foot on the gas. The possibility for improvement is endless, and with autonomous cars driving their way into our economy, the future si finally here.",0,0.0071344576,0,True
37E92AE1EE00,"Emotions are what you feel on a daily basis sometimes you can be happy and something you can be sad. In this passage ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" students from the University of Illinois collaborated with Prof. Nicu Sebe from the University of Amsterdam. They developed better ways for humans and computers to communicate. The technology to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because it can how how the student is feeling and it can help see if the student is enjoying what it is learning.

One facial expression can give it all away of how you are feeling. Facial Action Coding System can identify mixed emotions, each expression that is being made is compared to a neutal face that is not showing any emotional. If a student is having a bad day or something is wrong with them the software will instantly let them know how they are feeling. As in the painting ""Mona Lisa"" they were not sure what her emotions ""she's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disguested, 6 percent fearful and 2 percent angry.""

Another reason it is valuable is it can help see if a student is enjoying what it is doing. For example in the passage it says ""A classroom computer coul recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" If that were to happen it would be able to modify the lesson such a effective human intructor.

The use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. Examples of why it is vaulable are while a student is working on a lesson the computer can find out how a student is feeling and seeing if a student is enjoying what he or she is learning.

They have lots of fun in sport a lot of people mite get kicked out of sports and not have fun at school as much. Kids will have time more after school to hangout with friends. My last reason is if less people play sports less people representing the school.

If kids at the school already have a lot of work to do then when you add on the higher grade's its just making them struggle even more. who knows they mite have problems at home. play sports to get away from them. they already have school grades to keep up to a c even when they don't worry about that they have to worry a lot on sports if they want to make the cut.

I think if people get kicked out of sports they will probably be sad and wont care about there grades anyways. i know i probably would be. If they are already depressed about something else you should add gas to the fire. so if you would just leave it a c it would help them a lot.

If we have less people in our sports then we have less people representing our school and making us know. i hope this helped you change your mind. I really like hearing and watching all the sports so please reconsider your decision.

If we have less kids in sport cause of grades less happy kids and more depressed kids. so hope this essay helped you change your mind. sincerely,

F7561C027920,"In high school, summer projects (especially for advanced placement classes) are assignments that students must complete. There is no way to get out from completing those assignments. Teachers create most of these summer projects because they know exactly what the students should learn before they reach the first class of the year. For example, AP Language and Composition has the students create 15 precis on different nonfiction pieces and read the book

Thank You for Arguing in order to prepare for some of the essays that will be written for the exam. Although many people believe that teachers should create these summer projects because the students would know exactly what they need to learn or prepare for, nevertheless, students should be the ones creating the summer projects because it gives them a chance to show their creativity, use their skills from prior knowledge, and build on life skills needed for the future.

Giving the students the ability to use their creativity is very important because it lets their voices and thoughts be heard. Students usually have more time over the summer to be able to express their creativity, but that is being pulled back due to the same projects that teachers have them do every year. For example, most high school math classes provide students with a four to six page study guide to complete over the summer to make sure that their prior knowledge is still remembered. What if students created their own, unique study guides to complete? How about a presentation on the basics of a unit and sharing it with the class the first or second day back? Not only would the students be able to use their creativity in a project and express their knowledge in many different ways, students in the first class would have a great review of prior knowledge to prepare them for the challenge ahead. Giving students an assignment that they create also makes them more interested and determined to complete their project. Most students would rather show what they learned their own way than the same way as everyone else, and a lot of teacher-designed assignments have the students all doing the same thing. It might be easier for the teacher to grade or review, but students aren't enjoying the assignment because they aren't able to express their knowledge that is different from everyone else. Letting the students create their own projects will give them the opportunity to be creative and express their ideas. Additionally, students will continue to use or remember the skills and knowledge prior to help them create their projects.

The biggest reason why these summer projects are created is so that students wouldn't lose the skills and knowledge from previous years that are need for their upcoming classes. If the students created their own summer projects, they would not lose those skills or knowledge at all. More than likely, they would research more about certain skills or information in order to make their projects even better and stand out from their peers. Subjects such as science and english are definitely able to make this happen because the skills and techniques that are learned can always be worked on, and they are easier for students to share what they know about certain topics. For example, AP chemistry has everyone doing the same assignment before the school year starts. Students in AP Chemistry, instead, could create their own experiments with the skills and knowledge acquired from Research Chemistry. The students would not only keep the techniques/skills practiced and knowledge from the year before, but also have the opportunity to explore different skills or use the skills obtained at a more advanced level. Even though students wouldn't lose the skills and knowledge learned from previous classes, they would also learn and build on some others skills such as life skills.

Student-designed projects would build on skills that students need for the future. Teachers help them practice life skills with these projects as they could be long and tedious. However, students should have opportunities to build these skills themselves to prepare them for the upcoming school year and their future in general. Students who would work really hard on their own summer projects build their organizational skills as they plan out their assignments. Time management is another skill that is taken into these projects. Practicing time management prepares them for college and their future careers as deadlines can't be rearranged, and some tasks take more time than others. They would be able to schedule how much time in a day they can work on their summer assignments. Students who create their own projects also practice focusing and perseverance. There will be times where the project comes to a stand still in progress; practicing focus and perseverance encourages students to not give up on their projects and to make it the best it can be. In conclusion, students will prepare themselves for future tasks such as college projects and career projects when they create their own summer projects in high school.

So, what is the point on arguing about whether students or teachers should create the summer projects? These projects set up the students for what is coming in the following school year. The knowledge and skills used in previous classes are still needed for the upcoming classes. However, when students are able to be creative and make their own projects, those skills and knowledge would never leave them. In fact, teachers would be amazed at how advanced the skills of their students are because the students were actually interested in learning more to create an amazing summer project.",0,0.006435742,0,True
422B9A2CDAB6,"Technology is one of the fastest industrys growing rapidly in our generation. There are well over 100 ads on television that ties to better technology. These ads are to prompt customers into buying the latest devices such as the latest computer, mac pad, the IPHONE X, the smart phone that is as thin as a piece of paper, and the widest, flattest television screen. There is something that all of these devices do not have. Now a new system called the Facial Action Coding System is reaching the surface. This system allows computers to dictate how a person is feeling by just their facial expressions such as muscle placemnts in their face, the rise and fall of cheeks and under eyelids. So is this new system valuable, and can it be beneficial to our community?

This system is beneficial to our school communities. According to the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto its says "" a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,""Dr. Hauang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructure."" If computers were able to see how many kids were and were not ingaged in the activity that takes place on computers, then it would help the schools and the state to know what new things to try to keep kids ingaged so they can get the best possible education offered to them. This system is great for Istep test taking as well. Sometimes kids may fall asleep during testing or they may start too dose off and not be as consentrated as they should, and that could have a negative affect on their test. If the computer could read their emotions it would help us to know what the problem is and the reason why kids are losing focus and once we have confronted the problem we can then began the process of finding an affective solution.

This computer would be very beneficial in offices and in police stations. They could be used to help with criminal justice. A suspect can be told to tell their side of the story infront of a computer screen and the computer would be able to dictate that persons true emotions. This could make the officer, and investigaters job alot easier. They could be used in hospitals to keep an eye on how a paitent is feeling maybe after a recovery or when they are lying on their death bed. In the article it says "" They even can indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one."" So there is no faking of emotions out of a crime. Its also says "" In a false smile, the mouth is stretched sidways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius."" There is no faking with that computer.

This new system has the ability to make our jobs alot easier. Nowadays people dont usually communicate face to face anymore. That means people dont usually express theirselves in person as much as they once did in earlier days when technology wasnt around. So this can be a way to still be able to know how someone is feeling, esspecially if they are less likely to tell how they are feeling when your right infront of them. This can be very effective with younger kids who may not know how to epress how they may be feeling in the right way, shape, or form. This new system gives us a new way to still connect with our community. This new system is a pathway to a brighter future. This new system is valuable to our community.",0,0.0075429566,0,True

It is very dangerous at night, and anybody that is out after midnight increases their chances of doing wrong or becoming a victim.

Teenagers are still learning how to fit into this puzzle of life, and without a curfew to guide them bad things are bound to happen. Teenagers do not understand when their parents tell them no, and think a curfew is not needed because they are invincible and bad things never happen to them.

Teenagers need to learn that being more responsible, mature, and becoming a contributing member of society starts with having limits. Curfews will benefit not only teenagers, but society as a whole.

Teenagers think being responsible is not a good thing, because they never want to be told what to do.

If you want graduate from high school you have to be responsible.

Going out after midnight is not being responsible. I have already loss friends to violence, and it occurred late at night.

I have friends that have jobs, and they work after midnight even on school nights. They have trouble staying awake in class, and their grades are not good.

A curfew would also address this situation and help them succeed in school.

Being mature at sixteen is hard for some, but it needs to happen.

Parents need to show their children part of maturing is doing the right thing.

Being mature is understanding that you do not need to be outside late at night.

Maturity helps us understand that in life we can not always do whatever we want. I have friend that complain about not being able to stay out late, but as they mature they will understand that a curfew really helped keep them safe.

Going outside after midnight is very dangerous.

Teenagers must understand that with everything that has gone on the past decade with gun violence, drugs, and robberies; most of it occurred late at night.

There is a reason that most places are closed late night, and there is really nothing to do late at night.

Teenagers need to value their safety, and know that whatever they can not do before midnight does not need to done.

Curfews can help with this mindset and keep teenagers safe.

To reiterate, society as it is now needs to support teenage safety, and a curfew is crucial part in making this happen. Parents should support being more strict with their children's curfew. Midnight is more than enough time for teenagers to experience life.

2FDB1B6086C9,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I believe that policy 1 is a great idea because most students sometimes get done with their work before others and sometimes they just have to sit there. By this I mean maybe it would be a good idea if we were allowed to have our phones with us. If this is possible we should keep them off during classes and other educational things we attend while we are at school. I think it would be a good idea if we could at least have our phones during free time or when we are done with all of our work as long as we don't bother others. It is also a good idea to have our phones with us in case there is some type of emergency while we are at school and maybe the power gets shut off or something. The reason i like this policy is because when we are all done with our work, going on field trips, or even just having free time we should be able to have them at least to text the people at our school or maybe if possible people at other schools as long as they are not texting while in class. They could wait until they are finished with all of their work and then text back when they're done. I also think we should have them at our lunch period too. I think this because maybe when we are old enough to drive or maybe our siblings or parents could pick us up to go out to lunch every once in a while as well. I really think we should not have our phones on at all or out when we are having a test because someone could text someone the answer to a question or maybe if the had a camera phone they could take a picture of their test and send it to them and that would get you in a lot of trouble. Mainly i think we should only have them out in our free time, when we are going on trips, when you have showed the teacher that you're done with your work, and at lunch.

As an A average student I have never struggled with grades. I work hard and my effort pays off. It shows on my report card too! I only play one sport and it doesn't effect my grades much. During volleyball season (That's my sport!) I have a more organized schedule with time limits which benefits me by helping me to get my homework done, but on days with lots of homework or big games I struggle to get it done and generally miss some sleep. I think the policies should not change though because for people who struggle it is important that college should still be in their future.

Sports may be the only thing that gets them there.

From experience, I know fellow classmates with low grades often have bad backgrounds and the families behind them are not very supportive. That is not always true but it is common. That means they need a scholarship and it won't be for their grades no matter what policies and rules are in place, so they fall back on sports to provide scholarships. The policy should continue as is and will aid and promote college education for and more to young student athletes in our school.

As for extra circular activities they are only on occasion will look good on a college application and some may help to further educate students a fun, entertaining way that will hold their attentions in a place outside of school.

501548D29BA2,"Do you feel tired, over stressed, and ready to be doing things on your own time after school? After a long school day, many of us students want to be able to relax, spend time with our family and friends, and get done whatever work we have been assigned over with. Many students also have certain hobbies they enjoy to do after school, such as being apart of a sports team or something else. Some students may enjoy staying after school or doing extracurricular activities daily, but some other students may choose not to do that and do not enjoy doing that. Every student should be able to choose how they would like to spend their time, this is why the principles new policy that you must do an extracurricular activity should be banished. Students should not have to participate in an extracurricular activity because, they should not feel forced to do something that may not interest them, they have other after school priorities they need to get done, and they need a break and time to do things that are not related to school.

First off, one main reason the ""you have to do an extracurricular activity"" rule should be banned is because this is forcing students to do something against their own will. Personally, I do not like having to stay after school. After school hours should be the students choice in how they use them. Pressuring students into choosing an activity that have to do multiple times a week is unfair because the school may not offer anything they find interest in. A lot of students may have a busy schedule outside of school and do not have the time for any extracurricular activities due to being committed to something else. Our principle should really consider that extracurricular activities are a students choice and are not mandatory.

Next, another reason that this extracurricular activity rule should be banned is, after school students have certain priorities they need to get done. Most teachers tend to assign their students with homework that is due the next class. Students being able to have the time to get their homework done is something that is extremely important. Students also have things that they may need to study for when they get home from school. Studying is also very important and you need a lot of time, patience, as well as the ability to focus when studying. All that most students want is to be successful in school. Studying and putting lots of time and effort into your work is one of the big keys to success. Therefore, if a student is being forced into doing an activity they do not enjoy it ruins their ability to focus, and giving them less time to themselves because now they have another priority to do after school.

Lastly, the final reason the extracurricular activity rule should not exist is students need a life and things to do that are outside of school. Think about it, students are stuck in school for 7 hours five times a week. That ends up being a lot of their time spent doing things they all may not be interested in at all. Students should have some of their time spent in different locations and not constantly always at the same place. It is just like being stuck in your home for multiple days, you run out of things to do and then get easily bored, this exact same thing can always happen with staying at school too much. After school hours are the times students can go wherever they please and that should not have to change for anyone.

Finally, making extracurricular activities mandatory is unfair to the students because this is forcing them to do something they may not truly like and taking away more hours out of their free time. Some students might love extracurricular activities and getting involved, while others may like to do things that have nothing to do with school at all. I think it is very important to respect the students and let them make the decision for themselves. Students may already be doing an activity after school but they are just not school related or occur at the school they attend. Our principle needs to understand all the possibilities of why students may not do an extracurricular activity or may not want to do one.

strongly believe student do benefit from working in a group. Working in a group has it's advantages, and I feel it's a better choice. When work work in a group you can see different ideas,learn to work with other and also you can met new people.

When you work with other people you can see the different ideas also you can learn know things. You can see the same problem in different ways but as a group you try to find the best way to solve them. For example let's say you have to do a project for a class, and you have to do it in a group. As a group you can share you Knowledge of what you know about the topic and share them with you group . Also you can share you ideas with your group,and see if they like it or maybe they can add something more to your idea to make it a better one . You can see who you have in common with them also you can see the differences you have with you group members .

Working as a group can really have a good advantages. If it is a really big project you dint have to do it alone. Also you can split work and everyone can get a small portion of the project. You can also see people creativity. In a group every one is good in something, so lets say if there is some who is really good at drawing and some one really good in writing then the project can look really nice and the penmanship will look great. You can get it done half as fast with every one in the group does what they have to do and work as a team .

When you work in a group you can met new people. Maybe you change schools. You do not know any one at your new school. When you work in a group, you can meet new people and make friends. It also work if you are shy because in a group you have to communicate with others to get the work done, or you are just a born leader you can help other how to start the project together or tell people how to do thing because they do not know what to do first. Also it works so you can get out your confer zone and try new things. For example you really like to draw but you do not know how to draw really good maybe some one from your group knows how and they can teach you .

As a conclusion I think student do benefit when they are in group. Because not only they can share there different ideas. You learn how to work as a team. You can met new people, and make new friends.",0,0.007397501,0,True

07CDFB21E155,"Some know think venus is not a planet. Some know venus is a planet but we all can agree that it is very intresting but why would we use resources to get to venus here are some reasons why and not allow me to show you if it,s worth it. venus is not the farthest planet it is actually not too far so it makes it a viable option. The only thing is is that we have not been able to examine venus with amount of distance between earth and venus which doesn,t give us a lot of options but here is what we do know.

First of all venus is known as earths twin and it,s not called earths twin for no reason. Venus is the same size and density which would make it more acustomed to our way of liveing. sometimes venus is actually even the closest planet so if we timed it right it would make it less the journey. The only things is not a single unmanned ship has not survived for more than a few hours when sent to venus.

Basically this tells us at the moment that mars is a more viable option because we have actually landed unmanned ships on it to collect data this is why many people talk about mars instead of venus. Some problems that get in our way is the air venus has a thick atmosphere 97 percent is carbon dioxide. Not only that but venus atmosphere has highly corrosive acid the eviorment is much more harsh than earth.

This means that it will be a long time before we get to venus are bodies have adapted to earth over the years but it took over 2000 years for us to adapt to this level we can,t wait that long. Our savior nasa is actually coming with ideas to get us there at the moment they have been thinking of makeing blimp like vechile which will hover and fly high to avoid storms and what not. Though it would still be hot but the air pressure is close enough to sea level.

What to expect from nasa in the furture a blimp that might make us be able to get more data from venus. Maybe one day we will be able to inhabit venus with the ideas they are coming up with. The fact of the matter is that it,s going to a long time until we get their. So it seems mars is the better option for now. ",0,0.008430419,0,True
0161419B4ED0,"Texting and Driving

I believe that you shouldn't be able to text while driving because you are putting yourself and others at danger because you are no longer aware of your surroundings and can steer anywhere while you aren't paying attention. I understand that there are some things that need attention, but it's not worth the lives of innocent people. Nearly about 400,000 people die from texting and driving. 1 out of 4 car accidents occur from texting and driving and that's truly a shame. The average text sent takes the drivers eyes off the road for about 5 seconds and that's enough time to get into a life threatening accident according to SafeWise. com. These deaths hurt people mentally and physically and usually cause depression due to the fact that they lost a loved one to a foolish person. Some people don't even pay attention to the rules put in to place by the law and are seen constantly on the phone with someone.

These people deserve to get their license suspended and maybe even revoked because these people have no empathy for people who actually want to make it to their destination safely. The phone calls and text messages can wait because they aren't worth someone's life and it sure isn't worth going to jail for. Just wait until you reach you reach your destination to do these things. Keep this nonsense of the roads. The roads were meant for you to drive on not to text on. I think we should have some type of scanner to see if there are any active phones in use and if there are police or some type of authority should be alerted. This should bring down the amount of deaths caused by texting and driving. This is also another way to prevent texting while driving.

5EB43212A8DC,"Summer, the time every student looks forward to after being in school for several months. Unfourtanetly certain schools are requiring students to complete summer projects to assure they're continuing to learn during their break. There is a debate whether or not the assignments should be teacher-designed or student-designed. The assignments should be student-designed because their summer is already being interrupted by school projects, so the students having freedom with the project will motivate them to do it, the project will be more enjoyable because it will be a topic they like, and it will allow creativity.

Students will be disappointed that they go to school for roughly ten months out of the year, and the two months they do have off are filled with school related assignments. That's why having a student-designed project will allow the students to take a different perspective of the assignment. The students having a choice will motivate them to do the project because it will be something they enjoy. Most summer based assignments would be reading a teacher chosen novel and doing an assignment based off of it. No student wants to spend their summer reading a novel they don't find an interest in and then writing a paper about it. However they wouldn't necessarily mind doing an assignment if it corresponds with the vacation they're going on and a school subject they enjoy. Giving students a choice allows them to dig deeper and the outcome will be greater and it will allow a greater amount of success.

Another reason the summer projects should be student-designed is that students will find more joy in working with an assignment they like. Every student is different therefore they will appreciate the fact they get to do a project that appeals to them. This will also allow the teachers to learn about their students more at the beginning of the year, what they like, and what works for them. Students need a break to relax and let their brain interpret all the information they have learned during the previous school year, so loading them down with assignments is not going to help them recover. Having a student-designed project will give students the opportunity to learn and think about school but at the same time not be overwhelmed and have a negative outlook towards doing the project for school.

Having a student-designed assignment also allows the students to get creative and expand learning outside of the classroom. It will allow the teachers to see what the students are capable of. Additionally the teachers would enjoy grading the projects because all of them would be different. However the teachers will disagree and want a teacher-designed assignment because they will want the project to be organized and structured. Teachers would want to make sure effort is being put into the project and the students are retaining information from it. There will be many assignments during the school year for the teachers to plan assignments so during the break the students should be trusted to design their own.

Summer is what every student looks forward to, the fun vacations and plans they have. They're not going to want to complete a dreadful assignment. The students should be held capable of designing their own summer project so they will have more motivation to complete it, they will be able to find joy in it, and they will be able to think with an open-mind and become creative.         ",0,0.006381705,0,True

I believe that you should choose Policy One because cell phones can be an important source of information. I also nurture a belief that they should not be used during class times because class times are for learning and understanding what is being taught.

It would allow time for students to get things that are on their minds out of the way so that they could focus more on learning during class times.

I look upon it as students would not be as tempted to text during classes. I hold an opinion that it would help students to center their thoughts more completely with less things that do not relate to class work on their minds.

Allowing cell phones to be used during lunch and other free times could possibly encourage students not to use cell phones during class and to wait until free time is available to use them.

71A39287ACEF,"Dear State Senator,

In my opinnion the way voting is staged should be change to popular voting opposed to Electoral Voting. Electoral College is basically the congress voting rather than citizens. Do we get to vote? Yes, but the the Electoral College gets to decide where it's going. That how citizens should feel, make a vote and the candidate they want to elect is the place it's going to arrive to.

Citizens should have the power they think they have, all the protest and arguing about rights and many others that we have crossed over the years, does that not mean anything anymore? We live in a world of democracy, whoever has the most should be the President of our United States. Our duties as citizens are to vote, yes. Well, let us do our jobs the proper way. The government makes it look as to we have much power as citizens, but do we really?

They say that the Electoral College can do us wonders, by picking our president and knowing who the right one is for our country. Only we know us the citizens thats our right and now the are taking that right away from us little by little. Let me tell you why the Electoral College is dreadful, when we vote for which candidate we want to become our president it goes to a certain group of eletors and they use all the votes from our state to push up the candidate they want to become our presidant. Let's not forget about the

Disaster Factor . America almost hit the worse crisis in that known century, all becasuse of the wrong selection of an elector.

On the other hand another thing to worry about would a tie on the electoral vote. Then the votes are to be handled down to the House of Representatives, and if the were having a tie on a vice-president vote it would be the senator. Why don't you see the candidants going down to the state to persuade you to vote for them? All because of the chance they know that they may not have. Only beacuse the desision doesn't really relay on us. All of our voting has given us our duty and right, but do we truely do what we want to do?

Citizens and Candidates don't get the full voting experience as we used to. Votes are in the hands of the electors and not the citizens. Voting is what make makes America, America!

A9D54990F59F,"Driverless cars often seem like an abstract achievement that man has made that allows for drivers to be reckless and lazy. Many people believe that when a crisis may occur, people will be too lazy to take control of the situation and avoid tragedy, resulting in injury or even death. Or, they can even argue that driverless cars may seem like the world will begin to rely on technology. But, this is not the case. Driverless cars will hold a positive effect on the upcoming future because the cars could make up a very flexible bus or taxi system, only use half of the fuel that is used today, and allow far better response and control than a human driver.

If in the future there are driverless and self-managing bus systems, there will be much less need or demand for every person to have their own car and this could save many families a lot of money. Buying cars can be a very tough ordeal for families that have a hard time affording the lives that they live, and by creating a standard bus system, there will be less of a hassle for these families. Also, if the bus and taxi systems are standardized, the busses will all come and depart on a schedule, causing the busses to be more on time and more efficient than having humans drive.

Secondly, if there were a large increase in the stadard bus and taxi systems, the usage of gas and oil will drop substantially. Again, this wold help to eliminate one of the pesky bills many families have to pay for but through standard bus and taxi systems, paying for fuel will no longer be a hassle. Also, it is common knowledge that oil and gas are not reusable or nonrenewable resources so by cutting back on the amounts of these resources that are used, there will be a much more stable supply of these resources. Additionally, burning oil and gas has been causing terrible problems for global warming and climate change so by reducing the amounts of these resources used, the climbing rates of global warming will begin to decrease and this problem will then be a thing of the past.

Lastly, due to all of the technology and research put in to these cars to make them as smart as they truly are, these cars are more able or better suited for life on the road compared to a normal person. In order to make the cars able to drive by themselves (with the slight help of a person) they needed sensors that could determine where it was safe to go and when there was danger ahead. As stated in the passage, ""Within 10 years, those sensors had become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers"". When faced with a dangerous situation, these cars have the ability to quickly fix itself and avert from any danger or hazard there was. Because the driverless cars are adapted with this information, it is said that, ""The information from sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone"". In a time of a crisis or need for diversion, driverless cars are much more suited to take on the situation than cars driven by humans. Driverless cars have features that regular cars cannot manage such as the ability to brake each wheel indiviually. No human could ever be so perfectly ready or able to take on a dangerous situation that they could control each wheel. So, by having technology drive the cars instead of humans, it is considerably safer for the passenegers in the vehicle.

In conclusion, not only is it more intersting to say that there is a car that can self-drive itself, these cars are safer, more efficient, and are more able to create a system similar to taxes or busses. It helps the environment, it helps the needing families, and it helps in the case of a dangerous situation.",0,0.007261616,0,True
CBFD5CD8BCD9,"Yes, I believe curfew can keep citizens out of trouble by limiting how long they can stay out of their homes. It can improve the city in the process of making the citizens feel safe.

City council should adopt a curfew for teens. Curfew keep teenager from staying out for too long and helps them catch a midnight rest. It balances the world and helps teens managing the time they work in between their jobs and regular daily activities like a midnight jog. Curfews helps them plan to head home early because we dont know what may happen during the night. I love to have a limit on my time because I may lose track of time and be out for longer than I need to be.

Adding a curfew the city is a good choice keeping the citizens safe while improving the public law for less of a death potential. It wont go well if we dont get a curfew and I will explain why.

If we dont get a curfew things will be problematic. Everyone will be staying up late making noise and traffic comes as often while people will just do crazy things. Its important that the city needs a curfew so it keeps the citizens in check and makes sure that no one is up late who might be doing some illegal activities. Staying up all night is bad cause it doesnt help the brain function for u to gain strength for tomorrow. It makes you fatigued and dysfunctional as well as can make you miss important events in life as u go on restless. It is sad to see the amount of car crashes when people drive even though they didnt get enough sleep compared to drunk driving is another story. You can set a curfew for yourself to be safer and more energized for the next day because the early bird gets the worm.

Having a curfew isnt a bad thing. Its an mandatory rule that will helps u live longer, be healthy and keeps u awake for the next day.

on my opinion students would not like the idea of taking more time to study, because nowdays students are very busy, stressed, and tired of school, they would not like to have to hear more stuff that has to do with school . besides some people are more smart and they could take the class just to see how thats going to help, but sometimes people dont try the stuff and thats why, they never know if they are going to like it or not.

Cars arent cheap, not even in todays world. Especially a car that monuvers its self throughout the streets! Ask yourself if the price is worth the actual car.

Companies have to be aware of the problems the car may face. What if a part gets damaged or stops working for any reason! Will it be the companies fault or the person? The saftey of this car has to be garanteed to make sure the person is well satisfied! The cameras might be a consideration to this car because if there is ever an accidant , the camera will always be aware of whats happening to see what failed or if the person was not paying attention.

D228AB564BF6,"The dreaded summer assignment, boring students by holding them hostage inside and not letting them enjoy their time to be free. All the stress of the school year washes away when students leave the building in June, but then students are reintroduced to that stress with projects and extensive work that may not be of interest. The more likely the students are uninterested in the work, the more likely they are to not turn it in, so why not make summer assignments what the students want while introducing the course they are set to take. Summer assignments should be student-designed so those students can take interest in their study and make learning fun.

Nobody in the world wants to wash summer away with book work from the class they don't like. Projects like research papers, essays, and 20+ page packets can drown students for the months they have off. Summer before sophomore year, for my history class we had 2 20+ page packets to ""introduce us to the course"", when in reality, it was just a few hours a day for weeks of busy work of finding answers in textbooks. Painful summer projects, like my class's history packets, will put a bad taste in the students' mouth before they even step foot on school grounds for the year. Summer assignments have to be short, sweet, and efficient, or they will lose the student, potentially for the entire school year.

Students designing their own summer projects will interest them more in the topic, as well as transform the summer project from a burden to something students want to complete. Students should be able to pick a topic for a standard project, like a short PowerPoint or a poster presentation, where students can go hands on while learning. Those history packets would be much more involving to me if they had to do with the World Wars or Military history, and even more if they involved some sort of project component. Disinterest also causes students to be less likely to complete summer assignments. I know of plenty of students, that just won't turn in the project or assignment if they don't want to do it. Summer of Junior year, my class had an essay to write about a current political issue. Half of the class turned in that assignment on time because they just didn't want to do it or were plainly uninterested. Summer Assignments need to be like those A+ introductions to essays, they need to grab the reader and hook them into the topic early, or in the case of summer assignments, they need to interest the student so they keep going and are hooked for the year.

The only downside to student designed projects is the way of grading and assessing their work. The more freedom students are given within a project, the further projects are going to be from what a rubric wants, which can be a pain for teachers. If you tell students to come up with an experiment and make a presentation on a tri-fold board, you could have one kid coming in with a project about wildlife and one with a project about aerodynamics for a chemistry class, two experiments no where near being on topic. There is a limit to the freedom teachers should give students, but there should be extensive freedom to the students within guidelines.

The only way for a project students like to be made, you have to consult the students. Politicians in democratic governments don't guess what the voters want, they ask what the voters want. If teachers are trying to build something for the students, ask the students, it's simple.

Dear, Principal I believe you should go with policy one because you may never know what might happen and I think students at least deserve to have the phones out during lunch and free period. Students should be allowed to use the phones during these times because if not, emergencies may happen and we may not know until after school is over. For some students it is very important to make a phone call at least ones during free period or lunch. One of the other reasons why they should have there phones with them in school is, in these days like now you have a lot of school shootings happening or other dangerous stuff going on, that sometimes you have to call the police. Imagine knowing your mother is going to be delivering a child and she promised to you that she will call. Now Imagine no one home and your in school and your phone is taken away from you and your mom is the only one and she calls you because she had an accident and she needs someone to call help or you to come home. I also don't agree with policy two because things happen and in these kind of cases you need the phones with you no matter what. Children's safety is very important and they should carry a phone with them. Students can use there phones during free times, and lunch but after that they must immediately shut them off and get to class.

Thank you for your

5DE24AC546C3,"If your principal was to make a rule saying that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity how would you feel about that? I would feel like I was being forced to do something that I may not want to do. By making students participate in at lest one extracurricular activity could bring so much impact whether its good or bad and I think its mostly bad.

For example, a big problem is money, schools might not have enough money to support and make all these activity so they would have to cut school field trips, and other fun things that the students look forward to doing. Another problem is that parents might not have enough money to go out and buy the things needed for that activity let alone the things they need for themselves to eat, drink, and sleep under a roof at night, or maybe if the school says they will have it how would they get the money. Would we even have enough money to go on trips if we needed to, say we win matches, games and go to a competition to see who is the world winner we wouldn't have enough money for that so we wouldnt be able to go.

Therefore brings me into another problem time, we would have to plan to go to those competitions and matches, games for that activity, and the students might not even be able to go to the extracurricular activities because they already signed up for one after school they wouldnt be able to make both everyday unless they quit one, or try to switch schedules if they could but if they couldnt, the students would have to quit the one that there doing outside of school they dont get a choice to pick witch one to quit because the principal said the students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. If students are forced to participate in an extracurricular activity on top of the one their doing outside of school when would they have time to do homework, study for tests, hang out with friends and family they wouldnt be able to on weekend because they would be busy with that activity and on weekends they would rather have fun and hang out with friends than do homework I know I would.

Meanwhile, stress is a big and rising problem, students already stress enough with all the homework and tests that they have to do so by adding in work things onto their plate in going to lead to more stress and more failing grades do to stress and not being able to get work done in time. Stress is one problem a lot of people deal with and normally its mostly from school and by having a rule that all students most participate in at least one extracurricular activity your going to see a lot of students breakdown form stress.

Although having a rule that says that you must participate in at least one extracurricular activity could bring more people to be fir if its a sport or if its just like a debate club, chess club, or over all something like that it allows students to take a break from all the work they are doing, and instead of making it a thing you must be in you could say its optional and students would mostly likely be willing to join these activities.

Therefore, having this rule buy saying students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity should not be allowed because it overall isnt going to be useful or helpful buy creating more problems.",0,0.0081937015,0,True
1ED5037C1462,"In the article ""The Challange of Exploring Venus,"" The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author uses a few reasons to support his argument, but he tends to dwell on the challanges of going to Venus and not the rewards.

First, his first and body paragraph focuses on how it is hard to get the right timing to go to Venus, and how all of our unmaned missions have not made it or not survived more than a few hours. He ends paragraph 2 by saying that it is hard to get the right timing to go to Venus and we have not had a spaceship touch down in more than three years. This is not a good way to start his article becasue it leaves the reader wondering why we would even bother going to Venus. The author makes it sound very challenging from the start and does not leave the reader with much hope for the journey to Venus.

In paragraph 3 the author describes the deadly charectaristics of Venus. He talks about how the planets surface is 800 degrees Farenheit and how the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than are own planet. Then the author gives examples on what those conditons can do such and melting metals and crushing submarines. Once again the author dwells on the challanges of going to Venus and not the rewards. Between the first and second paragraph the author does not build a compelling argument to go the Venus.

In paragraph 4 the author starts to build his argument for going to Venus. He states that it is the most earth-like planet, and it has a surface of rocky sediment that has planetary fetures close to ours. Other than that he does not build a case for Venus that a lot of people would back up. His argument that it si the closest planet in case we ever needed to leave earth is an invalid argument becasue of the state of our tech compared to the extreemley harsh conditions of Venus.

In paragraph 6 the author describes ways that we have tried to research Venuns that haven't worked. In paragraph 7 the author describes possible tech made by NASA that could solve some of the issues Venus poses, but that tech is simply not ready yet. This of the essay starts to make going to Venus sound more feasable, but the technology he is describing is not ready yet.

In the article ""The Challange of Exploring Venus"" the author tries to make an argument for going to Venus. He explains all the challanges and then tries to justify them by the payoff being to settle human curiosity. The article is well written he just makes more of a case for not going to Venus. Maybe in 50 years the technology will be in a good place to go to Venus, but as of right now it seems too challenging.   ",0,0.0069686873,0,True

6348F3FAB2F4,"Needing help with a issue is a common problem that people often come across. Whether it is needing help with a relationship or just advice on what book to check out at the library, people often come to their peers and colleges for advice. Usually, people just come to one person for advice. Most this so that they can receive the most clean cut answer possible. However, this is not always the best option. Asking multiple people for advice on the same problem can result in a better made choice because they will be more informed on the possible solutions to their issue, and they are more likely to receive an unbiased opinion on the subject if they ask multiple people.

When making a decision, having more information on all the possible solutions can allow for a more logical and precise solution. The way most people collect this information is through other people. However, it is very common for people to listen to only one persons solution. They believe that you can get a more concise solution by doing this. Although this may be true, getting multiple solutions from multiple people gives you more information on the topic. One example for this would be receiving relationship advice from one friend verses multiple friends. On one side, asking one friend for help may result a good solution to the problem as it is more clear and simple and is not as complicated compared to receiving many different answers. On the other side however, getting one solution dose not allow for a compare and contrast of possible solutions through pros and cons, and does not give you all the information about the subject. This example shows that having one solution does not always allow for the best solution because most of the time you are not receiving all the information on the subject and arent able to compare and contrast solutions.

When asking for advice, unbiased opinions can result in a much better solutions. This is because when you receive biased opinions and advice, the information you are receiving is often not as factual and more from the heart of what the person you are asking believes. This is why when asking only one person, you are more likely to find someone who is very biased. On the other hand, when you ask more than one person for the same advice, the odds are higher that you come across someone who is unbiased, and has probably done some research on the topic. An example that would show this is voting for an elected official using one persons advice verses voting an elected official using multiple peoples advice. On one side, using one persons advice can result in a much more simpler reason to vote for a official. This also allows for a lot less stressful voting process as you do not have to compare different candidates. However, using multiple people means it is more likely that you will get more unbiased results. This also means that you can kind of figure out what the general ""popular vote"" is, or in other words, what the general majority of people are voting. This example shows that asking one person for a solution does not always allow for the best solution because most of the time, you are not receiving unbiased opinions unless you ask multiple people.

Asking multiple people for advice allows for better made choices because they will have most of the information needed to make a decision, and asking multiple people will result in a higher probability to find someone that is unbiased. When trying to get the best choice for a solution asking multiple people can allow for your decision to be unbiased, informed, and the overall most common choice. Remember, the best choice can always be backed up by others.",0,0.0072216243,0,True
7BF0B4AE6917,"To the principal:

Students are always wanting to be allowed to have cell phones in school and use them. I think students shouldn't have cell phones in school at all. I believe this because some students cant even follow simple directions like, "" Don't talk"" or ""Sit down. So I expect the students to take out their cell phones in class because they do that every now and then already. Most likely more students will be in detention due to the fact that they will keep on taking their cell phones out and getting into trouble.

Why would you need a cell phone at school? What would you use it for? You would just be able to use it at lunch and at other free times. Almost all the students friends are at school. So you just be texting your friends when they are right beside you are across the table from you. All students would ever do at lunch is text. Students would also eat less because they are busy texting their friends.

Some student will be sneaky with their cell phones. Students might be pretending to read a book when actually they are texting. And some might try to text in their desk.

I have heard that you have been reconsidering the cell phone policy on your school. And that is not something I blame you for, considering that the student body have been using their phones when the teacher is giving lessons. If I were the principal, I would have pick Policy 1: Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.

You must look at their perspective. If you have picked Policy 2: Do not allow students to have phones at school at all, what would the students think? They would think, ""Why did the principal outlawed cell phones in our school?"" They would then, protest to it and at one point in time, would rebel against the school.

But let us remove that scenario out of our minds and think about the people who doesn't uses their phones during class time and only uses it during where class is not being taught?

Yes, that by removing phones in the school students would be probably, paying more attention to lectures, but did you ever consider that they would also not pay attention? They would not pay attention to the class because it would be a sign of rebellion that cell phones should be allowed, not illegal.

Also, what about where the student is sick and wants to be pick up during lunch? Maybe one of the staff would see her taking out her cell phone and confiscate it and the student would get more sick, who will probably not attend school, the following day. So you see, dear principal, it is best to have Policy 1, instead of Policy 2. Student will still have their phones, but at least it would not be during class time where they would pay attention.

I personally think that thet are very beneficial.

These are some reasons why and how they benefit.

You may not know this but 1 in every 3 kids are socially awkward.

Making kids join an after school activity that they enjoy with other kids that enjoy the same thing as them will help them bond with others and make friends.

This will also help with communication skills not only with adults but also with others.

If they dont make mistakes and ask questions about their mistakes than they will never learn.

Sports and extracurricular will also keep kids out of doing bad things.

Most sports are like a gateway of getting away from drugs and drinking underage.

Most sports teams have rules against posting pictures with red solo cups in them to keep the team and players safe.

Colleges look at everything from grades to community service hours.

Colleges also look for leaders at school and in the community.

If colleges see that someone has good grades and is a leader in not only their community but at school as well that will really be beneficial.

It is never too early to start applying and preparing for your future.

As we know our countries obesity rates are going up daily due to new technology like phones and how kids are on their phones way too much and they don't get nearly any exercise.

If kids dont learn how to put down the apple phones and pick up a real apple then before our eyes the country will jut get more and more oboes.

Extra sports will help kids to burn calories and fat in a fun and healthy way.

This is also a good source of exercise without having to go to the gym or having a gym membership.

I think that in some way this is a good thing but also a bad thing. A good reason is that it will push students to strive for academic excellence. A bad reason might be that a person tries hard enough, but still does not have a B average. People who have a C average still should be able to play because sports will keep them out of trouble. Also, if you take sports or other activities from them, you take the thing that they most enjoy away from them.

So principal, I submit to you that if you change the policy, you will unhappy students and parents complaining to you. If a student is striving for the best they can do but still does not have a B average, they should be able to participate in sports or any other extra curricular activities. Teachers can report to you whether or not an athlete is really striving for a B average or more. If they do not meet these requirements on their progress reports, they should be able to practice but not play.

I am aware that you may take the action of making community service a requirement to all students. This action is inevitably going to cause controversy among students. I for one am very against this upcoming decision. Not only would this cause disruption, but it is also unfair, and will be just like forcing students to work using physical means to receive a good grade.

Now then lets take a dive into what your pending decision would impact upon us.

Lets face it many students do not or would not opt to participate in community service, its just unavoidable. Many or a majority of the students would refuse to partake in this service. I doubt i would not hear complaints about this very soon. who knows what actions those who opposes being required for service would take? They might use various as well as dangerous means to let their voices be heard.

Not only that but in my opinion it would be unjust to require us to do physical activity. Although not on a serious level like something like slaves would be, but this is the united states of

America. We should have the right to refuse community service, and let the voluntary people do the work that they want to partake in. Again as stated before think of what those who oppose would take not only during the pre-anger state of mind before doing service but during the service. They could do the opposite of what they are asked to do during the activities.

Most things in life come with or without reward? Right? Well if the case (and it would be very likely to). We were to receive a grade for participation in cleaning up our community that would be unfitting. We already have physical education to make us do physical work for a letter grade. Although P. E does this to some extent community service would be outrages. Sweating for an A ? I quite frankly do not think so.

Is that enough for you? Is that enough to make you postpone or abort this decision?

70DC91763832,"Homeschooling is a method used widely to educate the next generation; students who are home schooled can take classes with online colleges and even video conference with professors from those very colleges. Now obviously we aren't talking about homeschooling, but we are talking about our children being taught at home. Learning from home can be beneficial to children that may have dyslexia, ADD, ADHD, autism and other forms of learning disabilities; there is even a sense of comfort, for most, whenever a child is at home with his or her family. Students being taught in a more isolated environment provides them with a taste of responsibility and resolve. The purpose of public schools are to provide free education equally and maybe now that means branching out and providing free education at home.

Many children today are diagnosed with some form of learning disability, whether it be ADD or even autism, it affects how that student is able to learn. If a student is able to learn at home via online classes or video conference chat, it allows them to learn in a way that is tailored to the individual needs of that child. There are students that may disagree and say that they learn fine in a public school environment and dont need distance learning, so why not provide equal opportunity and allow the student to decide what works best for them. Students who are distracted easily tend to learn better at home in an environment that they are familiar with.

At home children tend to feel more comfortable because they are able to express themselves clearly without having to worry about chastisement from the school. As children we created bonds with our our parents, we always knew that they were a safe place; school isn't always like that, there are always going to be people there that may want to hurt us and be a distraction, whereas at home we can focus without worrying about our next encounter with that bully who may want to hurt us. Some people may say that they dont have a great relationship with their parents and that's understandable, but maybe thats a reason for them to choose distance learning, in order to reconcile those relationships. We may not always get to pick and choose when it comes to schooling, but why not take it if the option is given to us.

It's always easier to work on a report or a project in a library or somewhere quiet, right? It provides the student with a feeling of responsibility to get things done. Not only that but there is a resolve that comes from the process of finishing that project or paper. People may say that not everyone feels that way, but when we have a need to accomplish something, we should feel responsibility and a want to get things done. This idea of distance learning wouldn't be a suggestion if it hasn't already worked, which would mean that the students felt a responsibility and finished their said class or task.

In conclusion, our schools provide students with access to free education and although distance learning may not be the best for everyone, shouldnt we give them the option to choose? Our schools are teaching less and less and pushing for the students to learn individually, if that's the way our schools are leaning, couldn't we learn the same things if we were home schooled? Sure, there is still structure in our schools, but how lazy are they going to get? Because the more they push for individualized learning the more it seems like a home school co-op. Our students aren't just going to be the leaders of tomorrow because they are the leaders right now, they will have to make choices on their own at some point, so let's allow them to decide their path.",0,0.00843833,0,True

Not many parents have the time or money to put their kids in such either, and its also putting more stress on kids during and after school if having to join one.

When being forced to do something such as a sport or school activity the school has to find a variety of the kids liking. Making sure all the kids in his school have a place to have fun at and not just something they have to do and dont enjoy. Having all kids in something at a school can cause running into dept because thats a lot of kids you have to put money towards. Sports can run as much as two to a hundred dollars per kid for any sport, and when having to be forced into a sport that you dont enjoy why waist money. Even when the kids dont want to participate why even try putting your hard working money towards it.

Sports and activities for school are not free. The school has to buy equipment and tools for those opportunities and, sometimes not all parents can physically do that. Sports are a lot of money and when having to be put into one not knowing how you are going to pay for it can be embarrassing. Letting your kid down is the least a father or mother would ever want to do, and when working in the school board having to deal with phone calls from parents saying they cant afford a extracurricular activity would be heartbreaking.

Kids work really hard to put forth effort on school work,homework, and participate in school projects. That can be already enough stress on a kid no matter what age. When having to put another thing on top of school work managing time for sports, and extra activities sometimes kids just cant deal with it. Grades and having a good GPA can come first for some kids. Sports and other things come last. You could probrobaly already have something after school you do and having to move your whole schedule around can be really tiring and stressful.

I think community service is very important to our city because many cities are filthy and dirty and need cleaning, if we can get the whole school to do it, it would be great, and it would also become a good opportunity for our city, but i don't think it would be fair if the whole school is forced to do it, i would prefer if you were to make a list so people are free to sign up if they want to join community service.

Another example why community service shouldn't be highly instructed is because some kids might have some important things to do at home and might not have free time to help the community. Also not many kids have time to help because of all their homework and chores they might have at home.

The list would be an excellent idea because the people that sign up would most likely have time to help and would probobly be dedicated to doing community service. Although not many people would be doing community service you would know that the people that signed up are a dedicated group of people and would be glad to help.

Many people don't know all the pollution that is out there is killing animals and slowly destroying our planet' soon our planet will be completely a mess and would be a horrible place to live. Many people don't believe in global warming but there has been some evidence of global warming. One piece of evidence is there has been a major decrease in water. The water level is lowering and will soon be completely gone, witch will then lead to death.

Many people argue about this but all this pollution is doing a lot of harm to all the living things in the world. these are some of many reasons why we need community service so i hope you take my advice and use it for future reference.",0,0.0073919324,0,True

Dear TEACHER_NAME

It has came to my attention that you are reconsidering the school's cell phone policy. I personally am happy, because my cell phone is a big part in my life. I use it all the time and so do my parents. It's very convenient to have during the school year. Most of the cell phones today have internet access. Including my phone. That is something very useful to have even for school. I even see some teachers have their cell phone on one day, because they are expecting a very important phone call.

One of the policies I see you are considering is to allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch period and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class. I think this is the better choice, because if you ever forgot a homework assignment or gym clothes or something important you can ask your parent to drop it off.

Some teachers disagree with this because they say why don't the students just use the office phone? Well if you ever considered what students use the phone, you wouldn't want to use it ever again. A lot of students who call to home are sick. I doubt that the secretaries at the office constantly disinfect the phone.

Also if your parent does drop off something and the secretary announces it over the loud speaker, it disrupts the class. If you had you cell phone, you and your teacher would be the only ones who knows about it. Not the entire class.

I do think that is the better choice and a lot of students will agree as well, but i do see some problems with it. I could predict that because we could use the cell phones during free periods and lunch, most of the students would forget to turn them off. Therefore a there could be more disruptions.

Usually a couple of times a year at least one student's phone goes off during class. I think that this would happen more often because we would be aloud to use them. I think that the policy at school we have now is just fine. We are aloud to have them in school, just put away in the lockers.

I have to admit that when I'm doing my homework and my phone is right next to me, I easily get distracted. I'm sure that a lot of other students would agree that they too get distracted.

I understand that I have to pick one policy and I still think that policy number one is better, but there are problems to it. If I were you TEACHER_NAME, I would just keep the cell phone policy how it is today, or revise policy number one. Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME

Its a very time managed process, its not like they take some names, write them on a piece of paper, mix them up in a hat, and grab the first one you feel.  How big of a mistake would that be? Electoral College even sounds like a well thought out idea, for one it has the word college in it and college is where you get a better education for your future.  When electing a President you want to know that you will have a good future with the president that is elected.  Just because the Electoral College is old doesnt mean it isnt a good process.

Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people.  Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. ( So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actuallt gone to Kennedy.)

Voting for the next President of the United States isn't something you would just want to rest in the hands of popular votes, you could end up with someone who doesnt even know what he is doing, or even desides he can't handle all of the responsibility of being the President.  I feel very strong about my thoughts on the subject and believe that the Electoral College is still the way to go.               ",0,0.008350383,0,True

Imagine an increase in car accidenets because a malfunction occured in one of the cars. All the money and time that is being invested in this one specific project. Teenagers no longer getting excited about being able to get their license. Seems like a not so great world to live in.

Manufactors may promise people that their smart cars are safe and reliable, nothing will go wrong. But what they dont tell people is that they messed up on a couple thounsand cars, no biggie. The smart cars are no longer alerting the driver for when they need to take over. The spinning sensor just breaks down, with no warning whatsoever. That is one of the most important parts of the whole system. Everything could go wrong. Promises are broken by family; companies can easily break promises too.

So much money and time could be put into better and more useful things. This all started back in the 1950s with General Motors. Google has had working driveless cars since 2009. All of that time and money should have been invested into something that tis world needs. The United States of America has been in debt for a long time, but instead of paying off some debt we build driveless cars.

Teenagers are excited about finally being old enough to get thier permit, their first car. That is what the majority of us look foward too. We finally feel like an adult and have some freedom. With driveless cars, how would this all work out? In the pasage it says, ""... no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore.."" That is no fun. What will we have to look foward to now? No one will need cars.

I am against driveless cars. They may be what we dream of but that doesnt mean they are best for us. Malfuctions could occur which causes a rise in accidents. Possibly even death. Money and time is wasted on this project and it is not what the world needs. The world does not need driveless cars. Teenagers need to experience freedom early, by getting their license and having their own car.

69C6F32846E9,"During the summer, many schools require that summer projects be completed before returning to school so that students are able to keep their minds fresh and teachers don't have to introduce a new topic at the beginning of the year. Currently, many schools are choosing teacher-designed summer projects because they offer a standard between all students. However, student-designed summer projects can be just as beneficial as they offer a sense of freedom to the student while still completing work in a real world and student orientated way. Schools should allow student-designed summer projects because they enable students to have a sense of freedom, not only in picking the project but how they complete it, and students are more likely to be motivated in the school year because they influenced the material taught by the teacher.

Currently, not many schools offer student-designed summer projects because they feel as though the teacher will do a better job assigning the project and holding the students accountable, but students will feel more freedom and responsibility if they are picking what they want their summer project focused around. With student picked projects, students are still learning about the material in their next school year, yet they are having fun while completing it. For example, if the summer project was about biology, students could track a tree or follow a frog around to see its progress throughout the summer. At the beginning of the school year, students can present the project to other classmates and gain knowledge about a topic before an introduction by the teacher. Another example is a U.S. history summer project about any part of U.S. history. Most likely, students are able to find multiple to complete this project, whether it be a simple online search on a reliable website or a museum in their town where they can go and explore new information. At school, they can talk about what they learned and why it was a fun way to learn because they weren't just listening to their teacher, but instead gaining knowledge about a subject in a fun way. Overall, student-designed projects are more beneficial in the long run because students gain new knowledge about subjects that they would have found boring or unexciting in the classroom, by being able to have freedom around the subject and choose something they would like.

Schools should offer student-designed summer projects because when they are picking what they are interested in, they are more likely to be engaged in school because they influenced what the teacher's material is for the school year. When a student is able to invest in a summer project and center themselves around a topic, they are more passionate about what they are learning and causes an increased interest in what students and their classmates are learning about. For example, if a student chose to do a project on major cities around the world for their upcoming geography class, the student can choose cities that they are genuinely interested in, not ones that the teacher assigned. When teacher's assign projects to students, it makes students feel as though they don't have voice in the school environment and makes them less likely to complete the project because a teacher assigned it to them. Yet, when the student is able to pick and choose what they want to learn, it can cause a greater effect on the student because now they are able to learn and possibly share their information with their other classmates. The student feels as though they do have a say in what they are learning and this way the teacher can center their learning material around the topics that different students picked, causing them to be engaged which causes other classmates to be engaged also. Student-designed summer projects are an excellent resource that schools should utilize because when students are attracted to what they are learning, it causes an increase in the material and students are more likely to enjoy the topics they are learning about in the future.

Altogether, student-designed summer projects are more beneficial to the students and the teachers because students gain responsibility for what they choose to learn and teachers can center their subjects around what students chose, engaging students more in the classroom. While teacher-designed projects are a great way to focus in on what the main idea of the class will be, student-designed projects allow students to be motivated about what they are learning and more likely to spread their knowledge about their topic to other students. With student-designed projects, teachers are also able to evaluate students before some of the school year has passed to see if they may need more help or if they are not stimulated enough. This can ultimately lead to a better school year and students learning in elementary, middle and high school because teachers are able to determine sooner if the student needs special requirements. Overall, student-designed summer projects provide greater outcomes and learning than teacher-designed projects because they give students a choice, engagement is higher in the classroom, and teachers can evaluate students quicker, leading towards an overall greater learning experience. ",0,0.0065106414,0,True

I think that you should not change the policy to participate in sports from a C average to a B average because there are a lot of students who do not do so well in school and love playing sports and they already have a tough time keeping grades up so they could continue playing sports. Now if you change it to a C average they will have tougher time keeping there grades. I like participating in playing sports and I don't do that well in school. If you change the policy I am not going to be able to play sports and I am going to have a tougher time keeping my grades up.

Another reason is that you will crush the dreams of students becoming professional players and that is one of the biggest goals of many students who like playing sports and if they can't keep up there grades they won't be able to practice or if they are really good people won't notice them , and don't you want your students to be a successful person in life? Then they could be successful by being a professional player.

So please don't change the policy, just let students go out there and have fun by playing sports and representing there school , or chasing there dreams on becoming professional players. So hopefully this letter changes your mind about changing the policy.",0,0.0074019735,0,True

Where is one place you would like to visit?

I would like to visit Florida because they have really nice weather.

Florida is something special to me because I have family in Florida.

The place I would visit is my grandfather grave because my grandfather had died last year

To, begin The reason why I picked Florida is because I have really nice, cool family in Florida.

My grandfather had dies last year after he had fell and hit his head on the ground.

He is special to me because if it was'nt for him I would not be playing soccer right now.

Every time I score a goal i always do a celebration for him.

I have something valuable of his and that is the gold chain that I got on now that he gave me and I had never took the chain ever since he gave it to me.

I will take off this chain the day I die.

I had promised him that I will love soccer forever and go to college to play soccer.

The college that I'm going to is Generic_School.

The reason why I would like to go to this college is because I had went there for a scholarship and I had got the scholarship and they said that I am really good for my age.

Here go some tips if your not good at soccer you should go outside and practice makes perfect.

If your not good at it you should try I mean it is really not a hard sport if you think about it.

If someone say that you suck let them keep on telling you that for me I will take that as motivation.

The reason why I love soccer so much is because of my grandfather he loved soccer just like me.

Everytime I had went to Florida to go visit family me and my grandfather we would always watch soccer games and tell me some formation to play when I grow up.

The favorite things that my grandfather love to do was drawing, playing soccer and teach me some new moves.

Every morning we would wake up he will always take me and my brother to waffle house and we would tell some stories to me and my brother about what he did when he was growing up.

When he had fell and went to the hospital I was not but when my mom face time my aunt he found out that we could not move body shoulders down and then he had to get some brain surgies and all that then the week after all that he had died and we face timed my aunt and he prayed on the phone and we all was crying.

I had a soccer game the day after he died and I had scored 6 goals and every time I had scored I had always kissed my hand and point it up to the sky.

After the game I was crying because I was proud of my self that I played a game with all that stress over my shoulders and I said to my self I did that for my grandfather.

Then right after the game my mom had came to me and started crying because I told her that I was going to score 6 goals just for my grandfather and I did what I said I was going to do.

That night I was praying and telling my grandfather that I had scored 6 goals just for him and I was saying to my head that I was going to do that more often.

My next soccer game I had scored 5 goals but every time I go on the pitch I had always kissed my chain and touched the ground and point at the sky and I still do that today.

My soccer game in 2 more weeks and I am going to do what I need to do to take my team to the championship and I will play all my soccer games just for my grandfather.

All the soccer games I play they will always be for my grandfather and he will never forget that and if I have to do anything just to get some goals I will then just for him.

When I was in Florida my grandfather had bought me a soccer poster and a soccer jersey of my favorite soccer player.

He had got a jersey customize for that say my last name and my favorite which is number 7 and that is my favorite soccer player number to.

When I was little he had always send me some of his drawing and like always write a little back that say I will always love u miyo and miyo mean son.

When I was 10 years old he came down here to Virginia and he was visiting and he will always wake up at 4 o clock in the morning to go fora bike ride and when he came back he had always fix breakfast for us.

In the afternoon he will always 1 v 1 me or my brother in soccer for some money like 10 dollars but that is if we beat him do.

This why I play soccer just because of him.

Like when I get frustrated in the soccer game I will always take a deep breath and think about my grandfather and that is what always calm me down when I get frustrated.

He had always tell me if someone is talking trash always smile because that dont talk the most is the most strong ones in the game and I always tell them look at the score board.

Here go the reason why I would like to go to Florida:

Family and my grandfather grave.

I would like to go to Generic_City studios.

Go to the beach and get some nice weather.

In conclusion, Where is one place you will like to visit?

I would like to visit Florida because Florida have nice weather.

Florida is something special to me because I have family down in Florida.

The place I would like to visit is my grandfather grave. Another place I would like to visit is Generic_City studios because like your like in a movie because there are people that are dressed up as some characters.

Another place I would like to visit is the indoor soccer field and play some soccer there with some family and maybe some new friends if I meet some there.",0,0.007538649,0,True
E75466C9E022,"Dear Mr. Senator,

As you are most likely aware, the Electoral College is a long-debated, controversial process. I believe that it is in the best interest for the citizens of America that the Electoral College be abolished. Under the Electoral College system, voters do not vote for the president but rather for a slate of electors who will vote for the president. Voters cannot control who the electors vote for and it is not unheard of that any given elector may be ""faithless"" and refuse to vote for their party's candidate and instead cast their deciding vote for whomever they want. The people of the United States of America are speaking up. According to a

Gallup poll conducted shortly after Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency in 2000, over 60%

-a majority- of voters prefer to have a direct election over an election through the Electoral College.

One may argue that the infamous 2000

Bush Vs. Kerry election is rare, but nevertheless, it happened, are we going to wait until it happens again to make a change? We take pride in being a democracy, we take pride in living in such a place that was created by the people and for the people , but is the power really in the hands of the people? The power may be in the hands of the people, but only the 538 people who belong to the Electoral College. The system in place is flawed and the outcome can be manipulted to favor one political party over the other. In 1960, segregationists in Louisiana nearly succesfully replaced the Democratic electors with different electors who would decieve the voters and then oppose Kennedy when voting.

Another con of The Electoral College is a dilemma that has to do with the number of electoral votes given to each state. The Electoral College works in the same way that The House of Representatives does. The number of electors alloted to each state is subjective to the population number of that state. Take a state such as California for example. California is alloted 55 electors. States such as South Dakota and Alaska cant compete with the great power coming from the larger states. In the Congress, the Senate was created to balance it out, but there is nothing in place to balance the importance between large (high density)  states and small (low density) states. Even more worrying is the situation in which there is a tie. In the case of a tie in the electoral college, the election would be given to the House of Representatives, where state delegations would then have the deciding vote.

The Electoral College is outdated, unfair and impractical. The citizens of The

United States are more than capable of making descisions for themselves and do not need electors to make it for them. It is a non-democratic method of selecting a president and should be abolished.

Thank You.                                                                 ",0,0.00687828,0,True

If students had the option to take classes online from home then it would give them a second chance to pass and graduate so they wouldn't give up.

well, some friendships are made by internet, outside activities, and others by being neighbors for a long time, however, the most lasting and common friendships are the ones you made at school. Therefore, you spend hours, days, months, and years being socially with the people around you, but what if you don't want to attend to school, and decide to take classes from home?

At school, you don't only made friends and memories , you also earn and learn good advices, and you see different perspectives.

this is one of the reasons why people doesn't want to attend to school, and choose online classes.

Pregnancy at early age: The girls who get pregnant while they are in High School either take home school or don't go study anymore, when their belly starts growing they feel ashamed, and they tend to quit school.

I believe that all students should participate in an activity that interests them because you have the opportunity to meet new people, enjoy new experiences, and have the chance to prepare for the future.

Choosing one of these activities can lead to life long friends that share the same interests. You can meet new people who are just as passionate about an activity as you are. I joined yearbook and met many people who had a love for writing and journalism just as I do. You can discover who you want to be surrounded by in your life by finding different people through these activities. You find people who are working towards the same goal as you are, and you can help each other along the way.

New experiences are another benefit you receive from joining and extracurricular class. You have the once in a lifetime chance to experience these new activities. You can see what you are good at and what you enjoy, which could lead to a career in the future. If you join cross country you may find that you love the feeling of the wind against your face. If you join yearbook you may discover that you have a passion for journalism. You can perfect a skill that you have always had an interest for or you might find that you have a passion for something that you never thought of before.

Participating in an extracurricular class will help you prepare for adulthood. You will have to learn how to balance your time between education, relationships with family and friends, chores, and the activity you choose. In fifth grade I joined soccer, at that time homework was new to me, so I had to learn to balance chores, homework, and soccer. I benefited from this experience greatly, because when the middle school approached I had already learned how to balance my time, which made the transition easier. This will prepare you for college and everything after. Learning how to balance everything in your life is a skill necessary for when you become an adult. It is better to learn these skills when you are of a young age than having to learn it in the middle of a chaotic life in the future.

In conclusion, joining these activities offers many benefits. You will spend less time on electronics, which is healthy for the minds of all ages. You can exercise your mind by learning new skills and meeting different people.

I believe that all students should join an extracurricular activity because you can meet different people, and enjoy many new experiences while preparing for your adult life. Although it can be frightening to try new things, it will benefit you in abundant ways.

I find I live a much happier life when I am doing something I love, even though it may frighten me, than when I am playing it safe by never trying anything new. ",0,0.0074176183,0,True

By the time of 1947 he was discharged, Luke had taken nine trips! That's a record for any Seagoing Cowboy. A big reason that you should join it (as Luke recalls), is because you get to help people in need. And get to lean more about there country. In the story Luke says that he got to see the Panama Canal. Wouldn't that be amazing?

Luke felt that it would be a chance of a lifetime to go and be a Seagoing Cowboy, and he just couldn't say ""no"" to Don. In 1945 WWII ended and many countries were left in ruins. So Don and Luke signed up to help. They helped for about two years before they were released.

He says that he also has much fun on board as well, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. They played games of tennis and volley ball where the animals once were. You'd have much fun on board and on trips.

Those are just a few examples of why you should want to be a ""Seagoing Cowboy"". As Luke says it is much more than an adventure. It opened the world up to him and is grateful for the oppertunity that he had. There is so much more to learn about as well but if I were to try to explain it all I would need a lot more space.

41395A333EE6,"The United States has been known for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, but that's not all. It's also known for the different freedoms made available and its fair government. The electoral college is a system in which states choose representatives to vote on the president. In the past, there was a big debate on whether or not this process was fair. The electoral college is not fair or trustworthy for many reasons.

Imagine that you picked a representative who said they were going to vote for the person you wanted for president. Sadly, they ended up changing their mind. You could end up with a president you don't like or believe in. Voters don't have total control over who their electors vote for. To me, that doesn't sound very fair. If everyone were allowed to vote, the people would be able to ensure that there vote counted towards the person they wanted, and not towards the candidate they were against. Based on multiple polls, a few presidents have won the popular vote, but lost the electoral vote. That means that the candidate which was chosen by the people did not become president. Our founding fathers fought hard for our rights, and it's our right to a fair vote.

There are more problems than just an unfair vote. It almost sounds impossible that there could be a tie in a presidential election, but it has almost happened before. In the past, votes have been so close that only a couple thousand have seperated the victor from the loser. What would happen if the votes came out to be tied in an election? Who would become president? I'm sure some people could argue that the electoral college could fix this problem, but I don't believe it could. Since there are less people making the descision during the electoral college process, it is even more likely that there could be a tie. If one person were to vote another way, it could be the equivalent of 1,000 people voting the other way. Also, during the electoral college the electors recieve rewards if their candidate wins. The people in that state, or even the whole country supported the electors and helped them make their descision, so they deserve recognition too.

The electoral college is not a fair or trustworthy process. Americans have no control over which candidate their electors choose to vote for. Also, there is a better chance for a catastrophic tie. America is all about being fair and giving people the opportunities they deserve. So, let's give Americans the chance for a fair vote. z         ",0,0.0074072024,0,True

Positive personalities become to a good self-steem also, this make a better environment. Students with a good self-steem will be doing a better job and will make true the things their love.

A76DEAA44D9C,"Projects is like supreme pizza. Each project consists of many details and ideas, which combines as one big main idea. Not all projects are boring though; coloring and drawing plays a huge role in how the project is represented. My science fair project involved bright colorful headings with colored pictures on a poster board displaying how gravity affects light fragile objects. Summer projects should be student-designed because it requires students to challenge themselves, it allows students to be creative, and it helps teachers receive feedback.

One reason summer projects should be student-designed is because it pushes students to face a big challenge. For instance, last year my English teacher assigned a project to complete based on the book

Animal Farm by George Orwell. She explained we needed to design the format and organization of the main idea without going off topic. I struggled to think of a theme for my own for days. After planning for a while, I decided to illustrate pigs on their hind legs with ribbons, a horse, a sheep, a cow, and several guard dogs for the pigs. This project required me to think outside the box and was the most difficult one I was assigned.

Another reason students should design summer projects is because it allows students to be creative. For example, my Spanish teacher always assigns chapter projects, and the most recent I did was about the train station. I was allowed to make the project in anyway as long as I used the right grammar and all of the vocabulary stated in the chapter. First, I wrote a dialogue between an employee and customer with a variety of colored pens. Next, I illustrated small pictures for the vocabulary. Then, I glued the dialogue and pictures onto light yellow construction paper. Lastly, I designed the title with bubble letters and a blue colored pencil.

In addition, summer projects should be designed by students because it helps teachers analyze the students idea and theme of the project. For instance, I was given a project on trade routes in my advanced placement history class. My teacher addressed me to design the project in anyway about one out three trade routes. I chose the Trans-Saharan trade route and made a pamphlet that tourists would use to travel. I explained what food was there, what the climate was like, what they mainly traded, what was most interesting about the Trans-Saharan, what transportation thats provided, and what to avoid while traveling there. Once she graded my project she had a meeting with me about the way I expressed the trade route. She told me the idea was extremely creative and the information I used was excellent. However, she said the pamphlet would be more neat if I organized it and added pictures for examples.

Some students argue teacher-designed projects are more of a learning experience. However, student-designed projects teaches students how to be independent and responsible. For example, this year I was assigned a project on

Julius Caesar , and I was to compare two different characters by using my own theme. I came up with three different sections for the project on my own without help; I made two slogans and wrote one speech in the positive character's point of view. I had a week to complete the project and present it in class. The deadline and the whole project taught me how to manage my time more consistently, it taught me how to work alone, and it taught me how to be responsible for my own grades.

Moreover, summer projects should be student-designed to help students have a more knowledgeable education. I propose students write a letter to their principle about why students should design their own summer projects. As a student I would like to receive the best education so I am more likely to succeed in the near future. Designing my own summer project helps keep my mind fresh and helps me grow more wise as a person. Having to face a challenge myself, to be able to be creative, and to help my teachers receive feedback are reasons summer projects need to be designed by students. ",0,0.0075828726,0,True

Although some may disagree,students would not benefit from attending class at home.

There are various reasons why students may not benefit from attending class at home .Students who attend class at home may not get the same experience with there peers as to students who attends in the classroom .When a student is attending class from home they maybe unable to connect with a peer as they would in the classroom .Another reason a student wouldn't benefit is because they have not have the right equipment to succeed from home Every students parents may not be able to afford equipment for that class. Some students may have the equipment ,but it may not be the best to help to help the students succeed. For example, there are affordable wifi and laptops for students;however,it may lag or even run slow. That may cause a students to become frustrated and give up. Also, some students feel more comfortable with the teacher being present. Many students are more understanding of the work when being help and walk throughout the steps in person.

There are furthermore reasons why students would not benefit from working at home .When attending a class in person it can resemble a full time job .It trains students to be on time ,hardworking and good time management. When attending class from home students may not receive the dame habits. Students who attend class from home may wake up whenever they want to as long as they turn their assignment in on time .This may lead to bad time management and cause bad habits.

C619833B1D5D,"Whether you are someone who believes conspiracy theories, or are just plain stupid and think that somehow the Face is evidence of alien life, you are still wrong. It's just a rock, a plain, thousands of years old, heap of rock. The End, no ""Ifs, ands, or buts"", there is evidence saying that this is just a mesa, a landform, we have picture proof of it. However, considering that I must write this for Mr. Toad's Wild Ride, I still have to argue about it pointlessly with an imaginary person who might or might not exist. So, I will cover two major points to prove to you that it's a landform, common sense, and the facts that we here at NASA have proven to be true.

First off, this argument is over whether Face was created by aliens, or whether it is just a natural landform. This is a pretty strange argumental topic, as people who believe this stuff anyway will hardly be convinced by a random scientist at NASA. Anyway, there is proof we have that face is just a natural landform, we have taken multiple pictues of it, and have concluded that, as shown with this cite of evidence, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the America West."" We can even say that it was not obscured by any clouds or haze because it was clear day on Mars the day the picture was taken. That should be the end of the discussion, but yet you say, ""But Mister science man, what if the pictures that you took couldn't see it because it was too small?"" Well, that point can actually be rebuted as well, because of what Jim Garvin, the chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, said, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixer size,"" he added. ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"". Factually that should be the end of it, it was a clear picture, that was enhanced for farther detail, on a clear day, with a high resolution camera.

Don't think I don't see you thinking, ""But will a only a photo actually be able to properly discern whether this is natural."" Well......no, it won't. Actually, you have me entirely beat on the fact that it simply could be a landform, made by aliens. Yes, there I admit it, sit at home and laugh at the fact that I could be wrong. Look, Mister Whoever reads this for a job, I argue for a living with my friend, and there is simply not enough evidence to actually say that there is no way that this is not alien made. There is actually a chance, somewhere, somehow, a superficially small chance that aliens might have had someplay in this. I know that all sounds crazy, but seriously, think about it. All we have is some lously picture that, while it shows us the exteriror, it doesn't show us anything about the interior of the landform.

Here is the other side to the point I just made, think about this rationally for a second, could aliens really have made a monument or some strange thing on Mars, only for it to be found by humans? Probably not, and all of this is so improbable that I really don't even need to write an argumentative essay about it anyway. There is an extremely small and slim chance that aliens had any part in making a mesa on Mars.

So all in all, there is factual proof we have, cited from the text I was given to say that aliens had no part in the making of Face, and that it is a natural landform. However, it isn't concrete proof, so for all we now it could be an alien itself. I have no idea, and neither will you. Again though, rationally, it has no relation to aliens. So that's all I got, the end.   ",0,0.008591632,0,True
54AD5B3231DE,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Community service seems to becoming a big problem her in our local community. I believe that students here at SCHOOL_NAME should be required to help out around our community and well do some community service. To make a community strong and united we have to work together to keep our community clean and healthy and this includes the people living in our community also. Below I am going to list some ideas on how to get our school to help around our community to make it a better environment.

Pollution seems to be a huge deal around not only Crestview, but the whole Okaloosa County. I have come up with an idea that 10 students be selected from each grade every week, to go out and clean up the ""litter"" on our local highways. Pollution is something that can eventually wear away our ozone layer. So I believe that it is our duty as SCHOOL_NAME to take part in whatever we can to make our world a safe and healthy environment.

If you like this idea I would be glad to discuss further details with you.

The most important part of a community is the people who make up the population of the community. Crestview is a town where everyone pretty much knows everyone, I think it would be a great idea to help out at our local nursing homes. Helping the elderly is always good, they love to see children's bright smiling faces. We could donate items at the school that we are getting or wanting to get rid, we can also cook meals for them. The community really needs strong young leaders to take control and get the job done that needs to be done around the community, and I believe that kids that make up SCHOOL_NAME middle school are the kids who can eventually make our community a better place for everyone.

Who doesn't love a giddy little fund raiser, where you can buy everything you can think of. We really need to build new community center in Crestview and to carry that plan out we could do fund raisers. Fund raisers are a fun way of helping your community, I mean who knew that helping your community could be so much fun? Not only are you helping the community out of the goodness of your heart, but whenever you fund raise do you usually receive prizes? I believe you do, so this is a good way to help get kids to participate and help out around the community.

Overall TEACHER_NAME I believe that it is an awesome idea to have our kids here at SCHOOL_NAME to work together and complete community service. It would make our community happy and healthy for everyone!",0,0.007345868,0,True
FE776C83FE1B,"This would be good for students in many ways. Exersising, being more social, and having fun are all good things that come from having a extracurricular activity. Principal's should start doing this in all schools . Its really nice to get students out of their comfert zone sometimes. Students normally don't try for sports in school because they don't want to go through the fact if they don't make the team. Its hard for some people to go and try for something but some students don't think to themselfs if i dont try i will never know if im good at any sport.

Most students stay at home and be lazy all day. Being lazy is not good for the body and brain. Getting in a sport is amazing because people might have to take care of their little brother's or sister's and don't have time to take care of themselfs first or people might have other things to do but its always nice to put your health first. People can be very lazy and just lay around and eating junk food and playing video games all day and this is a good way to get outside and be with your friends. Alot of things that people are probably doing right now is not heathy for them, eating junk food is not good, playing video games and being on your phone to much hurts your eyes and its really important if u want to try for a sport if your eyes are good. It's just a great way to get kids off their phone and go outside.

Students tend to not socialies if they don't have to. Most teens in middle school lay in bed and scroll though instagram all day and night. Sports is a great way to get your social skills up. Some people are shy as well and might not try as well the first day ,however, students will get used to doing stuff in front of other people are give it there all. It's a great way to get kids out if their comfert zone and talk to new people they though they would never talk to.

We all know sitting at home is not that fun. Everyone gets bored at home and have not idea what to do, you run out of things to do on your phone and if you have no friends that live close to you it's very hard to find something to do. Doing a after school activity gets your mind off of things and gives you something to do after school. Being with friends is always fun when your doing something you want to do. People tend to just try out for a sport but not really try at the sport. Most students just go to talk to their friends and put no effort in the sport. You still have to try and put in a lot of effort going in to this kind of activity.

Principals should make kids pick a extracurricular activity. I agree with this decision becasue all students should have fun and do something they would not do.

51582221FB88,"Do you think students would benefit from being able too attend classes from home? In my option I would say of course. Because today you see many people allowing or wanting there child to be able to do there work at the comfort of there home. Simply because some kids learn better at home,in some cases it could be there is less distractions surrounded around them for examples class clowns,bullies,girls,friends and maybe even the class pet. But don't get me wrong there is some people who would rather learn from a teacher and be able to ask live questions. Maybe even find learning from home could be a distraction because of siblings and things of that nature.

The main reasons I feel like it would be a good idea is because I feel like everyone should have a option to send there child to a normal school or to do schooling online. Because everybody are not in the same shoes and when I say that I mean like as much as one person parent makes compared to the others. In example when kids don't feel compturble around there peers because of the cloth they wear. Maybe because of the way they look so they don't ask questions in class. So they don't wanna bring attention to them selves. But with a online teachers and being at home they will be able to contrate better and pay attention. Because they don't have anybody to worry about judging them for there answers or even the cloth they wear on there back. Also this is just one of my many big reasons I feel like this should happen

Another major reason I have in mind is that some students work to help them selves or the house hold. Because there parents may need just a little bit of help or sometimes students may watch there siblings while there parents are at work. If we did school online I know it would not last 8 hours of the day so that gives u time to rest before u go to work. Maybe even give you more time to put on the clock, also it could help with making a student better at being independent. If its like edunuity which are online classes because it shows dates and time frames for you to finish your work. It helps you learn time management and you choose when u begin your work during the day.

My next and final reason is if school was online we would not have to wake up early in the morning to attend school. we could start are online course when you wake up refreshed from a good enough amount of rest. You can begin to do your courses and maybe even the times when students are sick. Begin to feel better during the day or you where only feeling bad during the morning. Could go ahead and still complete the work that they would of missed. If you where in school and would have to do the work the next day after you feel better.

These are all my major reasons I feel we should do school online. I just feel as it would have a better impact on the students learning and independent skills. If we did begin to do online courses it should start in high school because that's when students begin to mature and they could handle doing work at home better.     ",0,0.008183203,0,True
2ECD72FE0B34,"I think that every student should precipitate in something at school. This is a great idea because students could get more involved in school and they can always know whats going on. They could precipitate in things like sports, clubs, and just any other extracurricular activity. This activity does not have to be any everyday thing. It could be once every week or every other day.

I think every student should precipitate in a sport or a club because it lead them to learning new things. Or it could open up new opportunities for them. Many students may not like this idea because school is already enough for them and they can't handle doing a sport or be in a club. I understand that but thats why all the clubs don't have to be school related. School can be very stressful and sometimes we need a break. So having these clubs during the middle of the day could impact how a lot of students preform in school. It could be a nice way to relax and get your mind off of the work you have to do but you would still be learning in a way.

This idea could also help build relationships, make new friends, and meet new people. At school on a daily basis you probably talk to the same people. If you are in a club or in a sport you would be able to meet new people and possibly expand your friend group. If you do not want to make new friends this is a great way to get closer with your friends because you would spend more time together and you would be learning together.

This could also make students find new intrest or hobbies. These intrest could end up being something they want to study in college. This idea is a good way for students to explore new things.

I know that not many students like this idea because they might think that its a waist of time or maybe they can't find a club that their intrested in. This could lead to them making their own club. So every student has a chance to be in a club or sport.

The first reason that the students should not complete summer projects is because some of them want to have vacation and they want to have a break in the summer. They get tired because they go to school everyday/every week in the morning and their body need to relax, need a break because some of them work in the night and they arrive to their home very night like around 12:00am and they sleep a little bit. So that's why some of them get tired to school, some of them does not want to do anything in the school because they are tired and they don't have enough energy in their body. However, they need to have vacations in the summer, sleep more and get more energy.

The second reason that the students should not complete summer projects is because they need to relax their mind, they need to forget everything about homework, about school and relax their mind because if they don't relax their mind they would be worried about every homework and they don't relax their mind. Also, some student could get in a big deppression by worrying about everything in school, more if they are working in the afternoon, they could die. So, they need to relax their mind and forget about everything in school.

The third reason that the students should not complete summer projects is because some of them want to out with their families, friends or to visit their families that are far away. Some of them wants to travel to another country or place and that is the only opportunity that they can go in the summer, some of their families are far away and they want to visit them because maybe they don't see them a long time ago, and they need to travel to another place to relax and have vacations. Visit their friends or out with them because the majority of students want to out with their families or friend like a group and have fun with them.

The conclusion is that every body/ every student need to have vacation in the summer and not go to school because they need to relax their mind and get more energy for their body, they need to have a break and out with other people to another place or country and have a lot of fun. ",0,0.007467292,0,True

I believe that limiting car usage is an important factor nowadays. Driving causes pollution which in fact harms our environment(14).

Paris has more smog than other European capitals(17). After all of this hard work of limiting car use, the smog actually cleared and people did not have to pay to drive anymore(19). Is limiting car usage helpful?

So in August of 1945 Luke and Don went to New Orleans to take apart in helping families. After getting their papers from the seaman they went and borded the SS Charles W.

CEF2E641BA34,"Taking Classes from Home

Some students want to take classes from home but others decided at the school or college . If they chose to take class at home they would have a way of online or video conferencing.

4F2CC610F271,"School is a sacred place for learning, making new friends and becoming more confident in yourself. Many students however, may not have the ability to be open and confident with situations in school. Having more availability to online classes can be a benefit for those students who struggle in one or more specific areas. As an anticipated result of online classes, students will find a way to be more comfortable in their academic studies. These classes will benefit all reserved, exhausted and visual learning students.

First of all, some students are very reserved and as a result they tend to be shy as well. Unfortunately, many other students have been bullied and stay to their selves. These events can lead to a student not being comfortable in their own skin, nor school. With a situation like this, online school would be a great option for these students. Not only can they gain comfort but they can be at peace with their academics and mentality.

In addition to, school starts early there's no doubt about that. With the early starting time, many students have a hard time getting their day started, driving their cars to school and may not have the time to stop and eat breakfast. This can cause students to become groggy and have a hard time focusing in school. With the virtual classes being available, students can work on their studies on their own time. Willingly, this will increase attention spans and students will be more studious.

Nevertheless, with the new era us students are more prone to learn easier on technology. I've had personal experience where taking an online English class was more comfortable than being in a classroom. Students are more likely to be visual learners. Having a computer to their face and being able to have their own visual of the work they are doing may become more helpful in the long run.

In argument, a good majority of students may not have internet access or even a computer. Libraries are convenient but not everyone might have time or access to a near by library. My community is lucky and grateful to have something open to everyone. Unfortunately, not many can say the same. In addition, students may face losing personal experiences as to school dances, meeting new people and having a face to face friendship.

In conclusion, online school can be a great benefit to students who need it or may just feel more comfortable with the virtual classes. With the online classes students can become more studious, comfortable and even increase in their academic studies. These virtual classes will be in style to the rising generations and become a great opportunity to students who want to prepare for the working world.                 ",0,0.110247,0,True

Less smog would be intensifying in other countries. more people would be released from the stress of owning a car people wouldnt have to worry about gas prices. The rate of car accidents would go down and so would the percentage of deaths caused by car accidents. more money would be saved since less people wont have to worry about spending any money repairing their vehicles or tuning them up.

Crime rates would decrease since less ppl would be able to commit crimes without a car,and no one could have their car stolen from them. Teen deaths caused by drunk driving would decrease as well. The cost of emissions would go down imensly and the U.S would gain alot more money because of less money spent on vehicles and and imports and gas,oil,tires and other vehicle related cost expenses. Limiting car usage is one of the best possible thing U.S American citizens can do to help preserve our earth and its enviorment.

It is best if everyone start to limit their car usage so that our planet can be less polluted and can be smog free. Cars are one of the biggest reasons for air pollution and we spend alot of money and them aswell. So i believe car usage should be limited for the greater good of our earth.    ",0,0.006556442,0,True
B3F552D38E68,"The face on Mars is just another fake thing happening in this world. Honestly it is just another natural landform. Scientist might have been shocked when they saw it back in 1976 but know they are understanding and learning that the face is just a natural landform.

The face is just a natural landform because their has been 3 pictures to prove it, you cannot always see the face, and only few scientist even believe it is an alien artifact.

The first reason why the is just a natural landform is because their has been three pictures of the face. On the first picture it may have taken just to find the face but everybody was shocked about it.

Scientist and NASA could not believe it either but it took them another 22 years to get another picture of the face which the pictures were a lot clearer and you could almost tell that it looked a lot more like a natural landform.

This picture was helping scientist and NASA out to it would help them find out more about the face and help them discover what it actually was. Then they had another picture 3 years later in 2001 which blows it out that it is totally a natural landform. It is really easy to see when you look at the picture in 2001.

This is why the three pictures help identify the face is a natural landform.

The second reason why the face is a natural landform is because you cannot always see the face.

Sometimes when you look at pictures and you see the face you might be wondering what is that. Especially when you see the picture from 2001 that just looks like a pile of sand and part of Mars natural landform.

When you zoom out and see the picture from 1976 the one that is not a close up you can easily see it is a face but then when you zoom in you might be like what is that.

This is why when you see the face and you cannot always see the face it is a natural landform.

The last reason why the face is a natural landform is because only a few scientist believe it is an alien artifact.

This means most of the scientist believe it is a natural landform.

Also if you cannot see that it is a natural landform then you must be blind because it is kind of obvious.

Just because some scientist believe it is an alien artifact does not mean you should believe that too.

Also you can obvouisly see that it is not a alien artifact it is just a natural land form of Mars.

This face is just another natural landform that just makes Mars, well Mars.

If only a few scientist believe that the face is an alien artifact than that has to mean that the face is a natural landform.

In conclusion, the face is just another that is not made up but not really a human beings face or a alien face.

The face is just another natural landform of Mars that people get confused about. The 3 reasons why is because of pictures, you cannot always see it, and only few scientist believe it is an alien artifact. This is mainly why the Face is just another natural landform on the Red Planet, Mars. ",0,0.007952878,0,True
06592F816295,"I agreed studient should being able to attend online school classes form home,For Example a final year studient has only English S.O.L

for him to take before he graduation some school dont have the acess to take online class. Insted they going make you pay your own money for you to have requrement. This is somethig schools have to provided for student. Like they have to created a system for student who dont pass their exam for the first time, They need to provide online school which you can acess on till you get your requrement. Insted tell the student to pay their own money for their goal. Also to support my idea public school have to promoted an aidea about studient with Health issues. student with health problem have to do home school. Taking class home as a lot of advantage for student, For example student who come form diffrent country as migrant has to base their class at home. Some of the bigest challenge this student facing in school is english, Imaging yourself come form differnt country you dont know how to speak english, you are fortunate to brought here for education. finally the school cancallion when it snowing they goinig to cancle shool. But with home school class you can still ready to learnd at any time. Teacher is always ready to teach as long as their is no internet issues. Also we see teenerger crying againt bully everyday, because they think school is not safe for them.

One of my reasone home school class can created a platform for student who are not born year. For exampe doing home class can help student form diffrent country. On Fortunate some student have the chance to travle to the U.S. to get a better education in the u. s. Schooling goes for four semisterin the state, but some part in the world education goes for three semister. This is why home class is important for student form diffrent part of the world . Anothe importan treason is home school class can help student with couple of the things like one on teacher, Also it help you to pay attention. Student with health issues have to base their learnig home, For example if a doctor tell you, you have a epiliples for the student to stay safe he need to do home school. it hard to see someone fall in front of your face do to illiness.

Another important issues i want to throw back is snowdays, We all know we it snow they cancle school. Think about you taking your classes at home. All you have to do is to woke up and take shower eat some breakfast and ready for class. Also we all know the world is full of technology is easey and simple to understant the concept Insted sitting in a class room with thirty kids.

Another important reason why home scchool class is valuable, It capicture the mind set of young teenerger. For example we see teenerger get bullying everydaybecause of come to school. Some of this kids think school is not the right place for them. we all know buying can led up to something like mential healthe, depression, we see lot of student drop out because of come to school. Home school can creat a playing field to learned.

Anothe issue i want to ineficiency security, Security is a key role to eveyone life. Around the U.S we all see how may school has be taget because of gun control. we all know school is a place we all go to achive a goal not to loose our life, For the past year now we all see the mass shooting in verious school in the U.S. So for student to feel safe home school have the better choise for student.

Finally like i side in all my pragraphy school is the the key to sucess. We all want to achive somethig great in life. for us to achive the goal we have to go the proper way. Example sometime we know how hard it is to woke up in the morning to come to school. We dont have option we just have to do it. online school can impact some student life emonition. Because some student dont have the ability to stand infornt of following student to present a project, It hard.

In conclusion I agreed online home school can impact the ways of people life, the way how teenerger see school to is not a safe place for them.

Lot of the facing bully everyday. Also we have a lot of teenerge buylling eveyday. Also student drope out form school because of come to school every day. think about people form different school, insted they come to school eveyday just for them to know english why can they just creat a platform for them one on one online school sytem.",0,0.0068311263,0,True
A24F3C793D72,"Do you know how seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice? I do, there are many reasons on how seeking for multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. Some ways it can help someone make a better choice are, more opinions, better opinions, and better advice etc. Anyone should seek for multiple opinions because it can helpful when you or someone else is in need of advice to help them make a better choice for themselves.

First, More opinions. Multiple opinions is more opinions, meaning more advice from people, some people might give some good advice, and some may not. Even if some of the advice you are receiving from people isn't helpful you might have someone that gives the best advice out of everyone to help you make a better choice for yourself. One time I asked all of my close friends for advice on how to be less shy, and how to open up, and make more friends. They gave me some good advice to help me make a better choice to open up and make more friends. With their help and their opinions I made the right decision to go out an make more friends.

Next, Different opinions. Not everyone that you ask for advice is going to have you the same opinion or give the same advice as anyone else. Some people may feel differently, or have a different opinion on whatever you or someone is asking for advice on. So when it comes to multiple opinions, there are also different opinions that can help someone or youself to make a better choice.

Finally, Better advice. With multiple opinions, and advice some people or someone might give you better advice, or might have a great opinion to help you make a better choice. Better opinions can lead to a better choice for you, or for anyone. One day I was going to a neon party with my sisters and my best friend. I had three different styled white shirts to wear to the party but I didn't know which one was best for the neon party. So my sisters and my best friend told me their honest opinions on my shirts, with their opinions on which shirt I should wear to the party I was able to figure out which one I was going to wear. They gave me advice on which shirt looked best for the party.

In conclusion of why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice, anyone should seek for multiple opinions, and advice because it can really be helpful to you or anyone so they can make a better choice or decision for themselves.       ",0,0.0073892004,0,True

31991AEB28DF,"Since the time of its discovery, the ""Face on Mars"" has baffled many people. Its resemblance to a face has caused it to gain much popularity, which has even led to a movie being made about it. Unfortunately though, there are people that would like to believe the Face is a sign of alien life on Mars. They have named and stated a number of arguments about why it is a sign, and even have claimed NASA is hiding it from the public. This is not true however, as the Face is simply just a peculiar looking landform. Yet, several counter-arguments and points must be made to drive home the fact that the face is just a landform.

Many theories that the Face is a sign of alien life on Mars have been spawned by the creation of books, magazines, and even movies that have been made about it. Almost all of the stories these things tell about the Face are science fiction, with a key emphasis on the ""fiction"" part. Sadly though, some people have chosen to accept these ideas made by an author or producer as the truth. Most of the theories about the Face were made for good stories to the people, so that their books and magazines would sell more. But, one must not forget the people who claim they have the scientifically correct reasoning behind why the Face is a sign of alien life on Mars.

The people who claim theories that aren't from commercialized stories regarding how the Face is a sign of alien life are a little more credible than the others, yet still can be easily proven wrong. This is because their main, and in many cases only, argument centers around a 1976 photograph of the Face. When another photograph was taken in 1998 however, the picture showed that it was simply just a landform. One counter-argument to this is that the camera must've malfunctioned or the picture wasn't clear enough, in which there is one fact that makes that counter-argument dissolve. The camera in 1998 reportedly ""snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos."", which would lead to the assumption that the 1976 photo wasn't clear. If that's true, then the ""Face on Mars"" actually isn't a Face at all. Simply put, the Face is a natural Martian landform.

In conclusion, the ""Face on Mars"" is certainly an interesting landform, but is in no case a sign of alien life on Mars. All theories about how it's a sign of aliens have been swiftly and easily disproven, and has been further proven through updated pictures that it is just a landform. Even though finding a sign of alien life would have been more interesting, one must always stick to the facts to know the correct solution. ",0,0.008688794,0,True

Some people had thought that it was fake and others thought that it was just a coincidence. The massive sand storms just created a face. That's all that they thought. But can that be true?

The face on Mars really hit it off on Earth. Everyone was talking about it. "" The ""Face on Mars"" has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows-even haunted grocery story chechout lines for 25 years!"" Some people believe that this face was created by aliens; it is a sign of life on Mars. But, ""few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact."" That is just crazy, but scientists are backing it up. There is no proof for it to be alien made.

Certain people still say that ""it's aliens, aliens are making these faces!"" That is not true without the evidence. Which, there is none. There are ablolutly zero facts that aliens would be able to make a face. Or that there are aliens. No facts. No aliens. If there were aliens how would they even make a face?

This has to be just a natural landform that formed when a massive sandstorm hit. It is just a coincidence. Nothing freaky or wierd, just a face in the sand. It's natural, not an alien. According to the text, ""What the picture actually shwos is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West."" See, nothing wierd going on on Mars. Or at least that we know of.

So, in conclusion, this artifact of mars is real. This is, because, there are no facts to prove otherwise. If there were facts than it would be ruled an alien artifact. Which would be pretty cool, but it isn't real. And we shouldn't be pretending like it is real. Scientists are backing this up here they are saying that it can't be an alien artifact.

Venus has a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide covers venus, even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfric acid in the atmophere. On the surface, temperatures average over 800 degress F and the pressure is 90 times greater than our planet. The conditions are extreme than anything humans encounter, due to the pressure and th heat of venus.

Beyond the pressure and the heat venus has geology and wather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to the land surface. It'll be dangerous even trying to live on venus but if you want to live on vnus be prepared for these desasters. Like for example our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over venus would advoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way.

This is why NASA is working on a wat to approach and study venus, like some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tsted in a chamber simulating the chaos of venus surface and have lasted for three weeks in the conditions of venus.

32A005569DEC,"The author of the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" presents a well written case on why mankind should continue to look for ways to explore Venus. The author presents the article starting off with information on Venus and how its challenges inhibit scientists from exploring it. They present the challenges in an orderly way, how scientists may be able to counter these challenges, and why it is so important to get there.

Getting to Venus will be the easiest part of the task that scientists are faced with. In paragraph 2 the author states ""Earth, Venus, and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus"". Getting to Venus is the easiest part of the task, but staying there will be exponentially harder. In paragraph 3 the author presents the many challenges scientists have to face to be able to stay on Venus following the logos method. These include but are not limited to ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide..."", ""clouds of of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."", and ""temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit"". That is just the atmosphere, not including Venesian geology and weather.

Despite all these challenges, the author believes scientists should keep trying to study Venus and shows some ways that scientists have already begun to take on the problems presented. In paragraph 5, the author cites NASA's possible solution on how to counter the surface of Venus. NASA wants ""scientists to float above the fray"" in a ""blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape"". Despite getting here the author presents another problem in paragraph 6 with scientists getting ""only limited insight on ground conditions"" because of the dense atmosphere. To counter that problem, the author cites another NASA approach to studying Venus which includes ""some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide"" and ""looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers"".

With all these challenges and oftentimes complicated solutions the author supports the idea that through all the trials and errors the payoff would be significant to satisfaction and provoking of human curiosity. In paragraph 4 the author claims ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life"". Being able to reach Venus's surface would enable explorers to look for life no matter how big or small and see if it was possible to survive the harsh environment. Even more so, ""Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth."" which would help scientists to determine how Venus was formed. The author appeals to pathos in paragraph 8 stating ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"". The author wants the reader to understand that mankind as a whole should not shy away from the challenges presented no matter how dire the situation and should face it head on, if for no reason other than the question ""Can we do it?"".

The author presents their information in an orderly fashion, makes their article easy and clean to read, and appeals to pathos and logos. They go in-depth on the situation, the solution, and why mankind should worry about it in the first place. All in all it is a quick and concise article that was well done and well supported.

924748264D34,"High school year is the most important year in students life. Some school programs allow students to graduate in three years,if you can choose, which one would you like to take? traditional or three years? For me, I would think of four years high school. Because traditional four years high school is more better than three years high school. For example, if you take three years high school, then you can not take elective courses except you take the courses during the summer time. Also, I think three years high school don't have much time to let you get ready for college. In addition, I think four years high school is more comfortable then three years high school.

First of all,if you take the three years high school, then you can't take elective courses except if you take the courses during the summer time. I think have elective courses was important, because that mean you can take courses that you interesting of. For example, I was taking the traditional four years high school right now. A year before, I remember I have two elective class, and one of them was Korean. Even know learning different language is hard, but it was very interesting, because you are learning about another countries' culture and how did they treat people in their ways. That's why I think elective classes was important.

secondly, take the courses during the summer time? Of course not. In the summer everyone was plan go to the beach or traveling to another country with the family. Think about that sunshine, sky, golden sand, and beautiful seas. There are people swimming and surfing, people wear the sunglasses sat down there and have coconut on their hand. But at this time, you have to take courses at home or summer school. Sitting at chair, face all these hard problem and finished it. In addition, summer is the time that people relax and have fun of. So I would not taking the courses during the summer time.

In addition, lots of students are feeling nervous and scared in the last year of their high school time. Because they are wondering what college they going to and can they do well when they get in the college. Even know I was senior right now, but that still happens to me, because college is totally different than high school, and I worry a lot about it. So when I laying down on the bed at the night, I was start thinking about college, can I make friends in college or what if the class that I take is going too fast then I don't understand what teachers are talking about. So I think four years high school would have more time to get ready for college.

Even know some programs are allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years, but think about that, if you and your friends didn't go to the same college, then you will have to leave them early and you also have to leave your family one year early.

Finally, I think traditional four years high school is more better then three years high school, and it makes you feel comfortable and have more time, instead squeeze the time together and make your self busy then others. Lastly, these are the reasons why I think traditional four years high school is better then three years high school.",0,0.008042198,0,True
FE01BAE235A1,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. And my thought for that concept is yes, students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home so students would have an advantage of getting their education from even farther distances.

In procedure many students get bullied, which causes them to be frightened or anxious that would prevent them from going to school. Also it would make them hesitate to speak up to an adult such as their parents,teacher,and even friends cause it would make them look weak. meanwhile from the offerings given from the schools it could repel from those incidents that will allow students to be more comfortable, since their at the house which makes them feel safer and less worried. Then students would have a much better capacity of their classes online that would make them focused and getting assignments from school finished. Students would'nt have to be concerned if they arrived to school late cause their able to attain school at home.

Next, The schools benefits from online learning assists students by having to worry about walking from class to class all day cause they could be at home relaxed; still accomplishing the tasks that are given to the students. While they'll have less distractions that would get students work done faster. Which is also better for students to comprehend and able to obtain the knowledge that he/she needs to pass tasks such as tests,homework, and projects. Also it won't include students to fall behind the classes having to catch up on their assignments. So students would relieved about having any missing work to turn in.

To other circumstances, multitudinous of students want to or have jobs after school. From the benefits it should be easily stabled so they can finish the classes at home and drive to their jobs. With that its useful for many students soon to graduate and may only have to take a few credits that would allow students to finish early in the semester for students that dont have jobs and are able to start working. Then when the students are done wit their classes they dont have to worry about school anymore. It would also be a help for them that want to start working for awhile so that they can think about what they want to do in the future.

The offerings that some schools have for online classes have potential for students to be successful in their education, and gain more wisdom. The schools benefits would be remarkably helpful and less overwhelming for students to attend classes home for students.

In conclusion these examples given are precisely my reasons to clarify and why I think students would have the benefit of being able to attend classes home.              ",0,0.006259566,0,True
4C07019D5AAC,"Have you ever been bored in class and need something interesting to learn instead of your tedious teacher lecturing you the whole class? With the new technology called ""Facial Action Coding System"", it can recognize your facial expressions and tell your emotions. This technology can be very useful in the classroom because It can tell if you are interested in the topic that you are talking about, Also it can tell if you are disinterested in the topic and need a little spark of interest, and lastly it can maybe even tone the learning down if you are too confused or getting angry to understand what is going on.

With all of this abundance of new technology coming in the future some of them can be used for our academics. With this new technology called ""Facial Action Coding System"" we can use it to improve our test scores, and starting to put interest into kids in school. Within the text it says, ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions-hapiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles"". This shows us that Dr. Paul Eckman has made technology that has the potential to recognize if people are interested in school. Also, with this technology it could provide feedback to the teachers to see how they are doing with their students in class.

This technology could also be able to tell if someone is doing poorly in the class because of disinterest. Dr. Huang says in the article, ""'A classroom computer could recognize when when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'"" What Dr. Huang says can alter the way that kids learn very dramatically. If you have a bored or uninteredted kid in your class the computer can recognize it immediately and change his/her lesson so that they are able to learn better without being bored.

Confusion, anger, and depression can also all be a factor on a child's learning, but with this new technology maybe it will be able to understand when they need to see a guidance councellor for help. Dr. Huang continues to say, ""Most Human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"" ,and he also says, ""so computers need to understand that, too."" What Dr. Huang is trying to say is that this technology can also help us with things that we don't want to talk about to other people. For example, if somone was having family problems at home and it was effecting their school work the computer would be able to recognize that this person was very depressed and can get them the help they need within the school.

Technology is evolving and we should be using it to its full potential of helping our future look brighter by increasing our academics with this ""Facial Action Coding System"". This new system could help out many students when they are in bored, confused, angry, depressed, or even interested in what they are learing. With all of the feedback it can help these students learn more efficiently. ",0,0.007008131,0,True
3C9C907C66C8,"Dear, State Senator

I have recently read articles about the electoral vote system currently in place in the united states.

The electoral vote system elects other people, called electors, to vote for the people.  They basically vote for president, if you and many others vote for him/her.  I believe the electoral vote system is glitchy, outdated, and confusing to some.

The electoral vote system can be manipulated and unfair.  The electors can be choosen by state conventions, state central committees, and the candidates running for president.  If the president can choose his electors, could'nt he replace the orignal electors for new ones that will guarantee a vote for him.  The peoples vote would'nt matter.  This situation happened in the two-thousand election when George W. Bush won the election with more indivisual votes than electoral votes.  This violates our constitution which states, the government is controlled by the people and allows for change if enough people in the US want it.  If you've ever noticed that during the presidential election, candidates don't come to certain states.  In the electoral system, each state has a winner-take-all system.  When the state goes over their electoral votes, the winner with the most electoral votes takes all of them, while the electoral votes of the opponent gets no votes toward him.  This can cause mayhem, the non-counted votes can make a big diffrence in the election.  In nineteen-seventy six their would have been a tie if 9,246 voters in Hawaii and Ohio voted the opposing side.  The elections come close and without the popular vote which accounts for millions of people in America, we may have had better elections with less debates.  The electoral college contains 538 electors, out of those 538 their only 270 are mandatory to vote.  Each elector equals each member in your states House Of Represenatives and add two for the senate.  California has a population of 35 million and wyoming has a population of 500,000.  Wyoming having 5 electors and california having 55.  This doese'nt make sense because if a state may have a higher population than wyoming but yet still have less electors.  The system is very confusing in these ways causing some to vote for the wrong candidate and others thinking they are voting for the right candidate they believe is true .

The electoral votes are'nt the worst because we are still showing our democracy, showing off Americas greatnest in its government.  The electoral vote crisis in two-thousand rarely happens.  This situation has'nt happened since eightteen-eighty eight, its a rare occurance.  Electoral votes also make the playing field even.  If we had popular votes in place, then wouldnt the presidents have a landslide if they went to all the biggest populated states.  The electoral votes can allow ties and close elections to happen instead of land slides in many elections.

The electoral votes should be replaced.  Even so they even out the playing field and the occurence of rigged electoral votes happen, it still doese'nt make up for the both elections lost in eightteen-eighty eight and two thousand.  If we dont change the electoral votes soon, the occurance of electoral vote sabotage will occur more often causing an unfair government to be in place.            ",0,0.0077584465,0,True
21EFAE02832D,"I believe students should design summer projects instead of teachers, what do you think? i believe so and here is why. Most students think more alike other students because most of them have the same knowledge than others but. That doesn't mean that the whole school will have students that could think like teachers. By all means this proves that there is a lower chance those students with high developed knowledge will be the ones doing the summer projects for others to complete. The students that do create some of the summer projects will make sure not to make them to hard or to easy that way the students doing them can surly keep learning during break without stressing about it. The students that make the summer project will also make them easier for there fellow classmates. Some of the students that are doing the summer project could be stressing about it but that also means they won't make it to difficult because they would want to get over with it already and focus on something else to get there minds distracting. So that we they cannot be thinking so much about school. As well as the students doing them won't stress as much about them because they'll know it's not to difficult and can do it any time during the summer, such being the last week or the last day so they can have all summer to them selves. Not having to think about school. When students aren't thinking about school that doesn't mean they're not learning it, just means they're trying to get there head off of something that highly stresses them about a lot of work or having to deal with for a long time and that's the only time they can get a break from it and not stress about school. The reason being of students doing them than instead of teachers they also won't have to do a lot of writing or work for starters. Students will be sure to not make them as long because they know what it feels like to get assigned a long and stressful assignment especially over the summer break that is the only time you actually get a break from school. Students also doing the assignments will help out teachers to also get a break and focus on other important related stuff they have as well. The students creating the summer projects can also be more open minded after doing them and grow they're knowledge as well as learning better and thinking of ideas more often for school. Teachers can review the students work and see how fine they do. The students who do well creating can continue to do so if they feel goo about themselves doing it for the other students that weren't so bright at it can give out ideas and help out the students doing them. I believe other schools and principals will be impressed by having a school with students creating they're summer projects and that is wonderful. I believe that having students create the summer projects is an outstanding idea for the community and school they will think of them differently and have a better picture of themselves. This argument has been good because it will open the eyes of many students and have them be brave enough to put themselves up for the challenge. If you believe students should create these summer projects instead of teachers write your own prompts to see what you guys have in mind. I think my argument is well stated and many teachers will surly think about letting it happen. Don't you believe so as well? Yes indeed you do.",0,0.007809484,0,True
BFFCCDE1E5DA,"Dear Principle,

I know you are trying to make the tough decision of whether or not students should be required to do a certain amount of community service. I myself believe that everyone should try to do some service that would give back to the community, it doesn't matter how much you do , every little bit counts. If everyone did something small that helps the community, then everyone would be doing their share of the work, and it all would add up to a better community. For example, if someone cleaned up all of the trash in the parking lot, then someone else could try to make sure people use the trash cans. Or if someone went to local food pantry to help hand out food, another person could collect food for that same food pantry. If everyone participates in helping out, then there is no telling how much good can be done. So if you are still deciding on whether or not making students give back to the community is a good idea , then maybe it would be wise to at least ask them to give at least a little of their time back because in the end it all adds up to a better picture.

84305C417C4B,"Extracurricular activities should be mandatory because kids could look forward to activities after school instead of going home and sitting around for hours. It would help kids stay out of trouble, keep students active, and help students build a social life.

Making students stay after school would help them stay out of trouble. Most students parents have and office job. The average work time is from 9am to 5pm, and school gets out at around 2pm- 4pm, so most kids are left unsupervised for around 2-6 hours. Kids left alone can get into all sorts of trouble and can be persuaded to do things that they know they should not do. Kids can be convinced to do drugs, join gangs, and vandalize public property. Instead of doing these things they can be supervised at school doing something that is fun and enjoyable instead of being mischievous. The school environment would be much safer because students wouldnt be influenced be other people to do any bad things, so they would not be doing or selling drugs and they would not be in or associated with a gang. Therefore, students would not bring in bad things into our schools. Making students stay after school would help them stay out of trouble, and stay good people.

The second reason that students should have to participate in an after school activities is because it is a way to get kids out of the house and encourage them to do something with their lives. Some kids go home and play sports outside or play a game with their siblings, but most kids go home and play video games for 5 hours till they have to eat dinner or go to bed. This is very unhealthy. An extracurricular activity would get a person who usually plays lots of video games to do something active. They could play sports after school and they would still have time for video games. Playing sports after school could convince them to play sports for fun, not because they have to do something after school and they could join a league and exercise more than just after school. This would help kids stay active and healthy. After school activities for all people is a good idea because it would help kids stay active and healthy.

Finally, making kids stay after school would help students build a social life. During the school day some kids do not socialize with others because they are tired, shy, or they are very focused on academics. After school, activities would really help kids gain a social life. After school activities are laid back and are made too do something active after school, not to secretly trick kids into too staying an extra hour after school. The activities after school are fun, they are meant to be. Kids after school who are shy can communicate with others because the activities give them ways to start of conversations and communicate with others.

In conclusion, Extracurricular activities should be mandatory. This would help kids stay out of trouble because it would keep them doing something healthy instead of something mischievous. It would students kids stay healthy because it would force them to do something active. and finally, it would help students because it would help students gain a social life because they could communicate with others.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ",0,0.0067850454,0,True
573CC8D2D71B,"Distance learning would be beneficial to students who can have hard a time staying attentive,who need to feel more comfortable, and who tend to be more susceptible to illness.

A classroom is full of disruptions, which can make it hard for students to keep attentive. By having online classes students can focus without a classmate or someone bothering them to talk, or wanting answers, or anything of that sorts. One could ask if a student at home could have distractions as well? The answer is yes but a student who works hard will understand that those distractions will be there later as well and if you are home almost all the time, then they won't be so much as distractions but annoyances that you can get rid of by moving to a designated room where you can be alone and free of any interference. And also parents would most likely get rid of any distractions so their child could do their best. Whilst at home students can also not worry about other peoples opinions on them.

School is a place of learning and its a place where you can express yourself freely and to feel comfortable doing so, its supposed to be a judgment free zone where students can make friends and be happy. Yet that is not reality, sadly school has become a place where people are put down for how they look and for how they talk, or for what is ""wrong"" with them. This causes many to have self esteem issues and they worry more about what they will wear rather than doing their homework. But the point being that distance learning would help so many become more comfortable in their own skin, which allows students to achieve the best they can in school. This would keep students happy and feeling good. It prevents bullying which helps prevent mental health issues within students keeping students safe from self harm or other bad things.

Students who could have mental health issues or recurring illness who miss a day or more of school would have the advantage if distance learning was in play because students could stay caught up with their schoolwork and maintain good grades. Being ill would't be such a problem for students to their classmates and teachers. Students could be home sicker than ever while still keeping everyone healthy and learning. However, one could argue that if you don't feel well, why would students get on the computer to go to school and learn or why would they get on at all if they were home? Well students understand even missing a day or two of school can put them behind for a couple days to even a week. So instead of risking to become a disappointment to their families and never having a good job or even a good life is worse. School is good for everyone even if sometimes kids don't like it, but they will all be grateful in the end.

B8E0146FEFD9,"Dear Principal,

Students should not be allowed to have their phones out at school at all. Phones are a distraction that can easily be abused on school grounds. For a the sake of everyone, they should be left at home.

The number one reason not to have phones at school, or even have them for free time, is the fact that they will be abused. Once you tell them that they can have their phones for free time, they will do that, plus they will also have them out during the non permitted times. Students will have them out in class texting their friends just because they all have their phones at school.

Also think about the fact that some student might slip an inappropriate text about someone in. That student will get in trouble because they did it on school grounds.

If all of the cell phones were at home, the students wouldn't have a phone to text with.

Another reason is the unsocial aspect of a phone. If the students have already been granted with free time, why do they need the phones. They can just as easily talk to their friends during free time as they can text them. In this modern world kids are already unsocial enough, so don't encourage texting by letting them bring their phones to school. You might have heard of or even seen the classic teenager at dinner with their family texting. They are being antisocial and not talking to their family. Do you really want that at school?

Also, think about the school. If a student looses their phone, or someone steals it, he/she will be upset and blame the school. Well it isn't really the school's fault, or is it. The school allowed the students to bring them to school, so why shouldn't it be blamed for the financial loss.

Everyone knows phones are distractions. If a kid goes to class with a certain text that so and so said in their mind still, they won't be able to concentrate. If the student maybe even brought their phone to class because he/she didn't finish their conversation, they surely won't being paying attention to the teacher. The students are at school to learn, not to have social time. They already have enough time after school.

I know the school faculty might say that they can enforce the rules, and even the student's might say they will behave with their phones, but I know teenagers always find ways around rules and abuse them. I know the faculty doesn't want to waste their time cleaning up the mess that phones would leave.

In summary, phones are an unneeded distraction for teenage students in the classroom and at school. If allowed at school they would surely cause more harm than good. To keep it simple on everyone they should be left at home.

E3EC69F1DA50,"Someone seeking for multiple opinions could have a lot of different meanings behind it. Someone could be doing it for fun. Others could be doing to practice being a reporter when they grow up. Others could be doing it for a school project. Point is, there are a plethra of reasons people could be seeking opinions. Here's why.

All humans have a curious aspect to there personalities. One way people love to express that is by asking questions 24/7. And this would benefit anyone that ask questions because when you ask questions, you get an answer. And when you get an answer, that is something new that you now know. And when you learn something that you never knew before, your knowledge increases. In other words: when you learn something knew, you get smarter and you can increase your skill set. That is why it's so important to ask questions. Because not only are you learning about something new, but once you learn that new thing, you are able to so much more in life and build many qualities as a person.

Another reason people could be asking questions for opinions is that opinions can sometimes be facts. The people that ask questions for opinions are probably looking for multiple answers so he or she may be able to figure out what they need to figure out. But first, that person would need to divide these opinions apart. Then once they are divided apart into groups, that person will decide which opinions make more sense. Which ever opinions make sense the most is probably the right answer and/or fact.

Another reason someone would want multiple opinions is because they want to practice on what they want to be when they grow up. A lot of jobs involve asking a bunch of questions, so it only makes sense that this is a reason of why people ask for multiple opinions. For example, interviewer is a big one. Their whole job revolves around asking questions. Same with journalists. Only difference is that they tend to travel all around the world. Don't even get me started on therapists. Usually therapy revolves around one person. But in this case, I'm talking about couples and family therapy. Cause in this case, there are multiple people in one session.

Another reason someone could be looking for multiple opinions is because they're looking for advice. Now what they are seeking advice about is very hard to tell because there are so many things people could ask for advice about. This would be because you sometimes come across something that you're not to sure about, but that's normal cause everybody does. And the most likely thing a person would do is ask multiple people or one person for advice and let them decide for that person.

This reason is a little different from all the other reasons because this one revolves around school. The next reason of why people ask for multiple opinions is that they might have to for a school project. More than likely, the project would be in science because that's the class you get the most projects. So you would have to ask questions to get opinions and see which opinions were right.

In conclusion, there are a varieity of reasons people ask for multiple opinions. It could be about personal stuff, art stuff, school stuff, pretty much anything really. Point is, people ask for a lot of opinions. And its a good thing to. Because without opinions, we wouldn't be where we were today in the world.",0,0.12956607,0,True

Luke couldn't give it up, it was special to go. Luke wanted to go was because he knew it probably once in awhile and that his mom or dad or family member couldn't afford him to go to the Europe on a cattleboat. Luke instead went with his friend, Don, because it was nice of Don to let him come with him. That was so nice to Don.

The teachers are in charge of the classroom throughout the school year and should remain in charge of projects over the Summer. It would be easier for the students and teacher if it is this way. Projects should be designed by the teacher because students would stay on topic, be able to receive help from the teacher, and wouldn't take as long to complete the project.

If the teacher provides specific details for the project to the students, then no student would be confused about what to do. Every student would easily be able to stay on topic and follow the instructions of the teacher. The teacher could design a rubric for the students so every student would know what they need to have on the project. A rubric would also make it easier for the teacher to grade by checking off what the student has based on the rubric. There wouldn't be many different kinds of projects that are hard to compare and grade. Additionally, some students may struggle with creativity and coming up with their own idea for a project. So, having guidelines to follow would assist these students in completing their project and level the playing field so struggling students do not get outshone by more creative students.

Teachers may also be able to provide supplies and help to students if the project is predetermined by them. Before the school year is over the teacher can assign the project and give out the supplies needed to complete the project to students who may need them. Having the supplies given to them can help students visualize the finished project. The students wouldn't receive a bad grade for using the wrong materials. The teacher could also easily answer questions if they came up with the project. Students could e-mail teachers with questions over the Summer and the teacher could respond quicker and clearer if they knew everything about the project.

Some may argue that students procrastinate if they know what the project is. This may be true, but if the project is laid out for them, it can be completed faster than an unknown, student-designed project. If a student has a project that they must design them self then they may be slow to start it since there are no steps or guidelines to be followed. If a project is designed by the teacher, then the requirements are listed beforehand and a student would more likely get something done earlier because it is clear on what they must do. However, if the student does decide to procrastinate, then it would be much easier for them to complete a given assignment rather than make their own and complete it on time.

Having teachers design Summer projects rather than students is easier for everyone. Students can receive help and supplies from teachers and have guidelines to follow.

As you can see in this passage, many countries have already begun to take a stand to protect our planet by limiting car usage to reduce the amount of gas emissions. America as a country needs to find a way to get involved as well.

In Vauban, a city in Germany almost all homeowners have given up their cars and turned to bicycling and walking to get where they need to go. Paris upholds a fine where people who have even-numbered license plates are allowed to drive on Monday's and odd-numbered plates on the next day. If a motorist did not abide by this rule they were forced to pay a $31 fine. Also, in Bogota, Colombia, the nations capital participate in an annual ""Day Without Cars"". Only buses and taxis were permitted and violaters faced $25 fines.

In America, transportation is the second largest source of gas emission, us as a country to take a stand to change that and protect our planet. With the rise in new technologies of things like cellphones and smartphones, cellphones now have car-pooling apps where it's as easy as clicking abutton to find a ride to work without driving your own car. It's also beneficial to you because you don't have to spend your money on gas, tolls and other fees. It's very simple to catch a ride on a bus or train as well, its cost efficient and good for the enviroment. Getting rid of your car altogether is beneficial in more ways than one. You don't have to worry about the cost to maintain your cost for things like repairs and insurance. And of course, you dont have to spend as much as $200 a month on gas.

Countries around the world have begun to use their resources to limit the amount of car usage. In just simple ways like carpooling or taking a bus or a train, each person can help in making a change to our world to save our atmosphere from pollution.    ",0,0.0068124146,0,True

I feel that cleaning up the community is a good way to keep the community clean. It is a good idea to get the kids involved, but I don't feel that all the kids should have too. Some kids don't have the time and effort to do those kind of activities. For example, some kids might have to do an outside activity, like sports, and don't want to take time out of doing fun activities. Maybe they don't have enough time during the day to do even those things.

I am on a basketball team myself I don't have enough time after school to do my homework. Plus during my free time, I like to do things with my friends. If you want kids to be cleaning up the community, have the ones that volunteer. Sometimes cleaning up the community isn't such the best thing to do. A school shouldn't have to worry parents that their kids have to clean the community and be at a certain place at a certain time. parents should let their kids pick if they want to clean the community. Parents should teach to pick up after themselves, but not to clean others trash forcefully.

Some kids will want to clean a community. I say that you, as the principal, should take a vote on what to do. I'll just say that I don't have the time to clean the community, but others might, so let the kids decide. If they decide not to clean the community, then let the kids at school decide on what to do with the community and go from there. Don't take my advice, I am just an opinion. Just make sure to do what's right for the kids.",0,0.007654106,0,True

I believe no cell phones is the way to go. I believe this because students who use cell phones in school will be off task and no do there work.

One reason why i think this is because the students need to get a education and n not worry about that text they just received.

Another reason i have that might convince you to listen to this is because if you follow up with this rule students in the school will stop worrying about phones and more about school.

Witch means better grades and behavior and also better testing scores.

Maybe even less drama because as you see there are many conflicts that come from texting and social net works because someone said something over a text message.

So by not allowing this you could possibly prevent fights, and other harmful situations from happening.

Students also have all before school and after school even weekends to text so it shouldn't be happening in school.

If you were to let the students have their cell phones out and let them text, they wouldn't pay attention in class, not no what there doing, and get bad grades on important test and even homework.

they also might not listen to the teacher when he or she is talking witch might aggravate them and become mad at the student.

To finalize this statement i have to share with you i would like to say if you consider this idea this could really change how the school runs and make things better then they were.

So thank you for reading this and hopefully you consider this idea for a better and brighter future.

Students all across the nation are doing community service to help out their town or city. Whether it is cleaning the streets, helping out in an old peoples home, or tutoring children at a school, all these deeds are good experience and good for the community. I think that it should be mandatory for all students here at school to do these good acts upon or society.

One reason why I think that we should have mandatory community service is because it provides knowledge and experience for the child. this is because after hours of dedication to helping out, children will see what good they are doing for their friends, family, and other acquaintances in the town. Also, there is a high chance that kids that are not heading the right path, will steer into the lane of success. By doing this, they see how they make other happy around them and will start feeling better about themselves and have a much greater respect around elders. To end off on this knowledge I would like to add that children that to participate in this will have a wider and more open mind. They will be open to new ideas and will learn something along the way

Another reason why this community service is necessary is because this provides less work for older, more delicate people, and more work faster and harder workers such as students that are in high school and college. While doing this less older people will be injured in activities such as cleaning the streets, their homes, and helping them with buying supplies needed for their health. This will cause a chain effect on them making them pay less for medical bills and more on other things such a necessities and other good that will help them through everyday life.

My last reason is because this will provide a cleaner and safer living area for little children and growing teens. By cleaning streets and parks, children will have a safer environment to live in and will grow up living in a much nicer area. It is a non-arguable fact that if a child is born and raised in a safer community, free from dangerous litter, they will grow up to be much healthier. From poisonous gasses and rodent killers, to little things like sharp glass and aluminum cans everything will be cleaned up. This prevents choking hazards and toxic fumes to be entered into a child's system.

As you can clearly see, Mr. Principal, community service is needed for three clear reasons: it helps children learn and experience the outside world, it helps the old people community, and makes it a safer living area for little children and adolescents. So please Mr. Principal, make community service mandatory, for the greater good of our living area. Just think about, would you want your kids to grow up in a dirty town?

Yes I do believe that students and myself should have a B average.

We also do need to try harder for ourselves because of the real world that's ahead of us.

I would love to have an A average but to be honest I'm not actually trying hard enough.

But I have to make up my mind that i can do it without having doubt in myself.

That's mostly why students sometimes fail or get held back because they think they can't do it.

I would also love having good enough grades to go to a good college and make a good life for what's ahead for me and my career. I want to have fun with my career and love doing it without having to go back to school because that would waste time for me and it could hurt my time for my job. I want to be a Pharmacist or a R.N. My dream career is to be an engineer on planes. I think I'm not smart enough so I don't believe in myself. Anyway back to the policy yes i do go with the principal on this on because he is right and he's doing it to help us out.

Mostly all my C average grades have come from my reading. I don't like reading at all because i find no fun to it. But I got to deal with it because it could hurt my life later on. I know there is lots of paperwork to be done and read. Reading is probably my most disliked subject and right now Social Studies is my favorite because its not a lot of homework and its actually easy this year but life isn't just handed to me. I'm finally starting to like science again because its interesting also. But for some reason I don't like reading. My dad loves reading, but my mom hates it. I guess I am like my mom. She doesn't like reading but she could solve any algebra problem you give her. My mom is real smart but I'm not. How do I know. because she didn't have her first C until her junior year. Can't no one tell me that my mom isn't smart. I've made so many C'S and B'S I couldn't believe it when I realized I had my first A in one class. But in grade average I'm like my dad.

D6EEEBA9A999,"In this article about the new technology being used on the painting of Mona Lisa the audience learns about what this new technology is really about. The first sentence of the first paragraph the author states ""she's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" Since the author begins this article with the percentages of Mona Lisa's emotions, we know that this is going to be about reading someones emotions, not only Mona Lisa's.

Further into the article we read about this technology being in computers and recognizing facial expressions. To have a computer be able to even calculate ones expression, the computer must construct a 3-D model of the face electronically. Imagine sitting infront of your own computer while having it read what you're feeling! This advanced technology is more than what we think. The technology actually improves lessons in school, based on an individuals expression.

To have this technology in a classroom, it would be highly beneficial to students and even teachers. The benefits a student would be receiving are improved grades, lesson plans that are interesting, being more focused, and having more benefits with learning than what a teacher could give. Improving grades can be hard and that could very well be because a student is just not able to pay attention to the lesson due to how boring or confusing it may be. In the article the author says ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Using this to help determine a better lesson plan for the student is great because it will make them more focused along with being interested in their learning plan. This can lead to the student knowing what they are doing on their homeowork which also leads to better grades.

Some may disagree with the opionion of having this technology used in classrooms. Others may say that no matter the lesson, the student could just simply be tired or un-interested in learning. If a student is either of those, they could very well not have a benefit to this technology. However, it is more likely that a bigger percentage of students woud have a positive outcome while having this advanced technology in the classrooms.

Those who believe that this computer technology is not valued in classrooms could think that the software might not work effectivley. When saying this, I am saying that those people may think that the technology won't really read a students expression correctly. The creators of the software could possibly not have all of this technology figured out 100 percent. Although that could be the case, we should focus on whether the students believe they are being benefitted while using it.

There will always be one opinion or the other. However, reading this article makes me believe that having this technology in classrooms would be highly beneficial to students. Getting good grades is a big part of actually being able to enjoy or understand your lesson. While having better lessons, you will most likely have better grades. Teachers possibly can not benefit the students in the way this new technology could with lesson plans and maybe more. That is why most people should believe that having the expression reading computer technology in classrooms is good for the students in more ways than one. ",0,0.007644746,0,True
65D6566825FE,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author informs us about the many difficulties we would face trying to get a closer look at Venus. Although it is the hottest plant in our solar system with air pressure unlike anywhere on Earth, I believe the auther does a great job explaining how we could overcome the challenges and maybe even send humans to Venus. The author suggests that the humans stay above Venus' atmosphere and lists what technology should be used to send down to the surface of Venus and retreive information about the planet.

The author's first idea to support the claim that we could do more to explore Venus in the near future is keeping the people sent there in a spacecraft, kind of like a blimp, about 30 miles above the surface. The author compares this to how planes fly above storms, which we already know is a good way to complete the task and stay safe. Although the pressure and temperature would still be intense, the astronauts could still do their job under these conditions.

Another suggestion the author does a good job of explaining is thinking about what technology should be sent to the surface to collect samples. In paragraph 7, the author uses examples of what could do the job, such as lab tested tech that could withstand the conditions for weeks and older computers which are stronger than today's. The use of these factually supported examples helps the reader get an idea of what we could send down to Venus and how it could be possible.

The facts the author uses to support their ideas of how we can better explore Venus, along with the descriptive details used to explain these ideas give anyone reading this a better understanding of how we could make this a reality. The ideas that astronauts could stay in safer conditions and send down strong technology to collect the data they need sounds like it could one day be a reality. Until then, we just have to keep exploring ideas to make it one.",0,0.00749233,0,True

Thesis

I honestly disagree with this knowledge is important.

Claims

Knowledge is more important than Imagination.

Can Imagination be helpful to you.

Imagination can happen to some people.

Knowledge is more important that Imagination

Knowledge helps your future become successful so how will Imagination help you. It wouldnt really help you just by seeing things with your head. Lets say you played would you rather would you rather have good knowledge or have Imaginations. Is there a way for Imagination to help you?

Can Imagination be helpful to you

Seeing things with your head wont help anything ,but it might help you if you think of anything it will just appear ,although, its not really there. Lets say you want a snow day you just Imagine its snowing outside but you still have school and theres not really snow there. Some people do Imagine things but why?

Imagination can happen to someone

A person starts to imagine things when he or she feels alone ,so he or she starts to think of an imaginary friend and they think that helps them not feel alone. Say that you just played your new game and you start to imagine in your head how fun the game was ,and what things you did in the game. Lets see what we learned.

One example is in paragraph four it states that long ago Venus was very Earth like in the fact that it was largly covered in ocean. As most of us have been taught that water is essential for all life to be able to survive. Venus also has many geological features similar to Earth in that it has valleys,mountains,and craters. These similarities make us curious and what to ask the question if Venus was so Earth like then did it ever contain living organisms? Also we must ask ourselves could it ever sustain life.

Another factor that makes humanity so curious about Venus as it states in paragraph four as well that Venus is one of our nearest options for a planetary visit. Imagine looking up at clear stary night and along with the pale face of the moon and the twinkling of the stars. You would see a shining glow in the distance wondering what could it be what is going on there and can I visit it. For Venus it is entirely possible to do so.

Though one might say that the author gave too many negative factors to visiting Venus. Yes he does but these are but challenges in the way of human curiosity. Yes the air might be ninety-seven percent carbon dioxide yes the surface might temperature might be eight hundred degrees. Can these challenges stand in the way of human injanuity and our will to discover the unkown. No nothing can stand in the way of human curiosity.

Because we are all failures, but we all succed in life, if we work hard. Success is not going to come to us as esay as pie "" we go to success"". To go to success we have to be failures in a consistent matter but we learn from being a failure, to fix our mistakes. Knowing that we want a better future and that we want to be successful in many things such as in school, work, sports and many other things we have in life ,that we want to become successful gives us enthusiasm eventhough if fail to do good at moments. Trying hard and keep tryin till you reach success helps us to keep our enthusiasim.

Being successful in school well help us in our daily life. We will go from failure to failure without the loss of enthusiasim. We know that by being successful in school we are going to have many opportunities in life. Being a failure is not bad, it makes us strong to keep trying more and more. To graduate from high school we all need to pass a certain amount of SOL. Sometimes we pass the SOL some times we dont,Thats what leads us to success because we are going from failure to failure but with enthuisasim ,since we keep trying and trying till we pass the SOL. Because we know that passing the SOL is leading us to success and that we have to work hard and go to success because its not going to come to us if we loss our enthusiasim to keep trying.

Work can make us go from failure to failure ,but enthusiasim well take us to success. Being successful in work may be hard that it might make us feel down or even make us feel like giving up. But always working hard and with alot of enthusiasim will help us succeed and acomplish many things such as getting a higher payment and getting a better employment can be possible if we always work hard towards success and with enthusiasim. Keeping enthusiasim is good because it doesnt only helps you to be motivated to keep working hard towards your goal / Success, but it helps your peers as well since your transmitting them the good vibe and enthusiasim. Others well succed too since your transmitting the good vibe/ enthusiasim to them they will be inspired by you.

Playing a sport is not easy. Alot of practice and dedication is required to because successful in a sport. Becoming successful in a sport will take you from being a failure and to a failure once again . But if you really want to succed in that specific sport that you like ,you will have to try and keep trying with enthusiasim. Trying with enthusiasim willl help you become successful in that sport that you like and that you have been practicing with your dedication and enthusiasim.

Others may say that "" Success consists of going from failure to failure with loss of enthusiasim"". People say this because they dont try as hard, if they get things wrong at first they give up. People wotn try to work hard and go to success they just give and wait for success to come to them (THATS NEVER HAPPENNING!!!). People also say this ("" success consists of going from failure to failure with loss of enthusiasim"") because they find it impossible that enthusiasim gives you the strength to keep trying.

Since they are the ones who are the failure that wont work with the enthusiasimto succeed.

Being a failure is not bad. Working to success with the loss of enthusiasim just because we fell a couple of times is bad. Because if we dont work to success and lose our enthusiasim we will never succed in anything we will just live our daily life as a failure. We are all failures but if we work hard we will become a better failure, A failure that succeed in life not a failure who just gives up and loses its enthusiasim. Working to go to success with enthusiasim will help you accomplish your goals and also it will inspire others.

Homeschooling is when the parent of a child, or sometimes even the child themselves, chooses for the child to be taught school materials right from the comfort of their homes. Another alternative is for a school to have video conferencing set up so that the student can be taught by a teacher from a school right at home. This style of learning could either be very beneficial or detrimental for the student in many ways. I believe that students could very much benefit from being able to attend classes from home online or through video conferencing because it's convenient, could allow for more direct learning from an individual teacher, and could even reduce stress for parents.

Being able to attend a class online from is very convenient because it could give the student more time to work and study the different subjects they'd have to take, while allowing them to have a level of comfort regular school just can't give to them. They wouldn't have to worry about being late for school, or having to walk if their parents weren't able to drive them if they lived far from their school. Overall, giving students the ability to take classes at home could play a crucial part in stress-free education.

Students could also benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it allows them to be taught directly from a teacher. There wouldn't be any disruptive classmates that distracted them, they'd be receiving the teacher's full attention. Allowing this would greatly improve the average student's overall academic performance, and would allow for many more creative and intelligent minds.

Allowing students to attend online classes would reduce stress on the parents as well. They would no longer have to worry about having to rush their child out of the house if they slept in too late, or was simply being too slow. Online schooling would simply allow the student to take more time with their classes, which would prevent parents from being stressed out about students.

On the other hand, some may say that allowing students to take online classes could have a negative effect on the student's social skills. While this could be true in some instances, I don't believe that school is the only place a student could be social in. There a plenty of other things that could play a key role in boosting a student's social performance.

6A652ADDA9B3,"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. This can help them make a better choice in many different ways. Discussing decisions with different people, not only gives the decision maker multiple perspectives to think about, but it also can help them gain confidence in their decision, and give them enriching new ideas to think about. All of these resources for the decision maker, will help them to make an educated and well thought out choice. With the opinions and thoughts of many people involved in a choice, the decision maker also makes a well rounded decision, that will positively impact themselves, as well as other people.

To start, every person has something to offer, and different people have different perspectives. While making a decision, many people may become stuck in their own perspective, and receiving advice from multiple people may offer a refreshing chance to look at the situation differently. If you only take advice from one person, their perspective has less of a chance of being varied from that of yourself, than if you get advice from numerous different people. This will help the decision maker to see the decision in a different light, and this may clear up any uncertainties for them. For example, you may view a color, and be absolutely sure that it is blue. However, if you ask another person, they may be certain that the same color is actually green. This shows, that different people can view the same situation in a different way. Furthermore, speaking with more than just one person, may help you to get an understanding of how the decision may have repercussions on other people, instead of just thinking about yourself. Hearing these different perspectives, may convince the decision maker to make a better choice, than if they had just spoken to one person.

Subsequently, seeking advice from more than one person, may help the decision maker to feel more confident about their decision. While speaking to other people, they may find that a good number of people feel the same way that they do about their choice. This will help them to feel more confident in their good decision, and they will be less likely to change their mind. An example of this same concept is in science experiments. In a science experiment, scientists always run multiple trials of the same experiment. This is so that they feel confident about their results. This is the same idea as having multiple people who have the same opinion as you do; you feel more confident about your resulting choice. If a scientist does not get matching results, then they feel that their results are invalid, and they run the experiment again. This is the same as if you do not find people who have the same opinion as you, and you rethink your decision. If you thought you had made up your mind, and then you speak to more people who have different opinions, you are more likely to rethink your choice. This will help you make sure that you are truly making the best choice for yourself.

Finally, the ideas of other people may help you to formulate your own. While everyone has their own perspective to give, they also have their own ideas. Everybody brings something new to the table, and if you talk to more people, you can hear more ideas. These ideas may convince you to think a certain way about your choice, or they may help you unlock some of your own ideas. Either a new opinion, or a new idea, may be exactly what a decision maker needs to finalize their decision, or make a completely new choice. These new ideas, may also help the decision maker to understand the decision at hand, in a more fundamental way, which will help them to understand the impact of their choices. This, can lead to a carefully made choice.

In conclusion, seeking the advice of numerous people offers many thoughtful benefits that lead the decision maker to the best possible decision. New and different perspectives on a specific decision, will help the decision maker to understand how the decision may not only affect them, but how it will also affect other people. This may also help the decision maker to get out of their head, and look at the situation from a different angle. Hearing opinions from numerous people, may also help you gain confidence in your decision, and if it does not, you will know that you may need to give your choice more thought. Finally, every new person that you speak to, will give you more ideas that may influence your decision. These ideas may shape your decision in ways that you never would have thought about, had you not spoken to more than one person. These ideas and opinions also may give you a new sense of clarity over your choice. Overall, seeking the advice of multiple people, instead of just one, will help decision makers to make choices that are well thought out, thoroughly planned, and best for not only themselves, but for other people as well. ",0,0.9806465,1,False

I think that what you are doing is wrong. Students should not be obligated to do community service if they do not want to.

I do know that community service is great for helping other people or just cleaning around, but some students do not want to do it and some have sports or other things to worry about and i just think it could cause so much stress to students. Community service should come from the heart no because one is obligated to do it , at least what you should do is tell the students that community service will give you extra credit , i am sure that many students will join immediately just because of that.

Here is one example why you should not make it mandatory for students to provide community service, well it would cause more stress to the students. Most students stress about homework, work at school , grades ,sports ,etc. , if they are obligated to provide community service then that would be just another thing to stress about , and i am sure nor you or the parents want to see a stressed or depressed child.

Another reason is because if students do community service it is because they want to, in order for you to provide some community service it has to come from your heart. The majority of students that did not want to provide community service will hate it and some may even hate you. Some students might even leave the school because of that. Some rebellious students might even mess up the work that others have done in the community because they feel they do not have to work.

I can give you many ideas though on how to get students to provide community service with out any obligation. For example provide a prize for the students that do more community service, that will have students provide more community service then they use to. Also you can give them extra credits for any class, the students will have credit for every day that they provide community service, the credits begin to stock up and the students will have the option to choose any class/subject that they want or need those extra credits for. As you can see i have some good reasons on why you should not make it mandatory, but if you feel like students need to provide more community service then use some of my ideas. As a student i think that if use you use at least one of those ideas that i stated then more students would join. Thank you four time and i hope you decide on what is best for the students.",0,0.0069708223,0,True
BDF13939FA26,"Students may say inactivity is the way to go, However other student say keeping yourself occupied will lead you towards achievement. But staying occupied is the way to go if you wanna be successful and achieve things in life. Sitting around and doing nothing wont lead you to anything sucessful in life.

If your at home sitting around having nothing to do will not help you to be successful. If you try to find something productive to do it will help you in the future. To be productive or to do something productive really does'nt have to be school work related it can be anything like having a job, chores or helping around the community.

Lets say you have home work but you dont feel like doing it, because your used to not doing anything and or are lazy to do it. which means you are more likely to procasanate. On the other hand if your used to doing your work the same day its assigned and or turn it in on time you are less likely to procasanate because you are used to staying occupied and doing all your work.

From my own expierence, when i was 14-15 years old i wouldnt do anything at home or at school which caused me to do negative things that didnt lead me to achieve my goals at that moment. Now that im 17 years old i keep myself busy by doing school work or working my part time job, which wont cause a negative effect on me because im preparing myself for my future and life goals.

Overall students think that doing nothing is the way to go, but other students say that keeping themselves occupied leads them to a succeful and positve life.

I believe that you should choose the first option: Let kids bring cell phones to school to use during lunch and free-times. I think we should be able to talk with people. We don't always get to see everyone, even if we are in the same school, we don't always have the same classes, and people want to stay connected. Also we can make plans and talk with parents, if we have no phone, we have to use the phone at school, and realistically, who likes doing that? -nobody I know. Also we (or sometimes our parents) are paying for cell phone use. If we pay, we should use up that time we are allowed. Lunch time is a time to eat, take a break from the school routine, and catch up with friends. Passing time is for getting to classes, sure, but lots of students use much of that time to simply talk with friends while they can. Don't you agree that these times are good for texting or talking?

Before and after is also a good time to use a cell phone, which makes it necessary to bring one to school. On the bus in the morning, unless people bring their i-pod or homework, they are pretty bored, texting is the perfect cure. The same thing goes for after school: plus then, there is much more to talk about. Basically as long as students aren't cheating, or not paying attention in class, cell phones, I believe, are a perfectly fine thing. Please, also consider that many kids will just be getting a cell phone sometime during high school or middle school. Who wouldn't be excited to use it for the first time-feeling cool, having freedom and having fun talking with people? If it's really true that you (and others in charge of school rules) want us to have fun (while learning) and have good memories of school, you would consider our wants and let students bring cell phones to school, to use during their free time. Taking away the use of cell phones is like taking away social lives. The students and I would all be very grateful if you would let us have our cell phones during school. We can learn and pay attention as well, but it is nice to have freedom during the time we have available. After all, that is why it's called ""free-time"" isn't it? Thank you for listening, please consider this with much thought.",0,0.0070368364,0,True

I think if a student has a c average you should give him or a chance. It would be un fair cause if a student did his or her best and all the could give is a c then you should let them play. A lot of students aren't able to pull of a b average so give those students a chance to play sports. So will you change that policy for all the students that pull of a b average cause a c average isn't that bad they are still passing but they can play sports and anything else they want.

This is how i feel about your policy, there are so many students that only have sports some people that don't have sports they end up doing nothing. People drop out of school cause they think if they don't have the grades to play sports they cant do anything with their life. So i know you don't want that to happen so take some time and think about it what you are doing. Before you make your finale decision. So can you please change it.

We can save comically and collect less polution In source one the German Suburbs are car free, where street parking, driveways, and home garages are forbidden generally. Car ownership is allowed, however where a carowner buys space for their car has to pay near 40,000, along with a home. As a result according to source one 70 percent of vaughn's families do not own cars , and 57 percent sold a car to move here. Many citizens complain when the gas prices go up, but if we limit our car usage we wont have to complain anymore. We will save money, because when we decrease the usage of cars we wont use as much gas or diesel. Heidrun Walter told Elisabeth Rosenthal that he now lives happier this way. Not only do we save money but we also relieve tension through out our bodies.

However we may not enjoy this new idea of limiting car usage some of us actually enjoy driving but, there are days where after a long day of working the last thing you want to be in is in traffic jams.""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman named, Carlos Arturo Plaza who rides a two seat bicycle with his wife.

In other ways that limiting car usage could help us is by eliminating pollution, of course everyone enjoys breathing in fresh air. By limiting car usage we can help lower polution. According to source two,"" After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city,"" the usage of car produced so much smog that they had to ban driving. Many of use drive to so many places that are near by that in reality we dont really have to use our car not only will we reduce pollution, but we will also maintain ourselves fit by using different alternatives like, walking, running, ridding our bikes. Although some may say, "" what if its an emergency,"" its fine we're only limiting car usage, we aren't goining to ban it forever.

If we limit car usage we can not only save money, but we can also reduce polution, and have a better lifestyle. Although these aren't the only ways limiting car usage can benefit us.",0,0.0074711773,0,True

ABED0C27DF2D,"180 days: the average amount of school days in a year. While many students dread the idea of attending school, students' attitudes towards school can change depending on which schooling option they choose to take part in; however, not all options create an equal opportunity for students. Though some argue that online school is more convenient, public school teaches students necessary life skills that allow them to flourish socially and academically, explore subjects in depth, and better prepare themselves for the future.

Friends are some of the most important figures that we value in our lives. They encourage us to try our best, take chances, and act as a support system. By attending public school, students have the opportunity to meet new people every day. Whether it be through joining a club or trying out for a team, friends are always there to motivate us to be the best individuals we can be and help build our character. Students who learn through online school often miss out on the opportunity to meet new people with common interests because they are isolated to a computer. This is dangerous because it can damage their health and lead to mental issues, such as depression. By constantly being surrounded by peers, public school also improves students' social skills and teaches them to work with others. It is important that students frequently interact with other students their age to build strong communication skills for the future. This is another significant aspect of life that online students are less exposed to and struggle with when they are faced with reality. By attending public school, students are exposed several interactive opportunities that help them work together and build friendships.

One of the major benefits of public school is that students are often more passionate about subjects and feel comfortable when approaching them. Online students do not get many opportunities to take group field trips and study subjects up close. By attending public school, students are exposed to a wide range hands-on activities that expand their learning and bring them closer to the real world. In addition, they can directly ask their teachers questions and receive immediate help. Instead of waiting days or even weeks for a response from a teacher through an e-mail, which online students may struggle with, public school students have the advantage of being present in that moment. By being in the classroom, it is easier for teachers to communicate with their students in person where they have the space to fully explain a subject or demonstrate a lesson. Technology often creates a wall between online students and their teachers, making it difficult for online students to know whether or not their voices are heard or even represented. When names can be matched with faces, connections are immediately created that allow teachers to get to know their students better and construct learning styles in a way that best fits their students needs. This also strengthens the connection between the student and the teacher, allowing the two to build a healthy relationship and help the student feel more comfortable when reaching out for help. As opposed to online school, public school allows students to make personal connections and confidently succeed in life.

Most importantly, public school helps better prepare students for the future. The social skills and real-world experiences that these students are exposed to help make their transition to adulthood more comfortable. By making new friends and learning how to work with their peers, especially in groups, students enhance their ability to positively interact with others and help each other succeed. Class activities and explorations also help students get a better idea of all the different career paths available and teach them the necessary skills they may need to succeed in the future. Online students are often at a disadvantage when they are thrown into the real world because they have not had the space to practice these crucial life skills. Public school benefits students in a way that will impact how they react to society and approach future challenges.

In conclusion, for the sake of future success, public school is more beneficial for students than online school. Public school exposes them to different areas of life and allows them to better handle any situation that may come their way in the future.",0,0.9925216,1,False

These are how having projects over the summer are beneficial now to students who do summer projects that teachers made for them. The more students take the time to learn things over the summer with less distractions the more smarter the students will get. The more students start focusing on school and not on other students. The more work that the students have, the less trouble the students get in. If the students have projects over the summer they can get a good grade and had 3 months to work on it to make it perfect. When students have more time to work on something the more things come to mind to pick from.

These are having school projects in summer are benefits later to students who do summer projects that teachers made for them. Students that work hard in school now have a higher graduation access and do summer projects by the teacher. If you do projects in summer you already get a grade for completing it and its better for your class grade it you are ahead. The more harder the project is the more time you need on it that why its good for the summer projects especially if you are in a higher grade.

Students like myself also have a lot of homework when they get home from school. Some kids just can't go to any after school activities because their parents work a lot and no one can drive them. Forcing students to do something they don't want to do is bad anyways.

So when I get home from school on someday's I have to go to tutor, or boy scouts. That's two days out of my week that I have used up. Sometimes my week is completely full when soccer season comes around and sometimes I have nothing to do after school. Then I usually just hangout with some friends because who wants to go out of there way in mid march when the sun is shining bright to go do student council. Not me that's for sure I'd rather have fun then do something I don't want to do or didn't sign up for.

I know were in eighth grade and people say they get more homework than us and that's true but the amount we get is just horrendous. Picture this your about to hop on video games or go play with your friends and then you mom says ""Don't forget to do you math, science, civics, PE, German, and English homework."" Like where did all that homework come from because I don't remember marking in my agenda thirty different assignments to do. If anyone thinks eighth grade is easy it isn't I have to keep my grades above a B or my parents go ballistic so do you really think I have time to make a yearbook.

Some kids can't go to certain things on some days because both of their parents work late.

220B64DA6B5C,"Summer projects are a great way to keep students brains thriving during the summer-time. They are designed to keep people on their toes, and so they dont develop a terrible work ethic that will reflect in their following school year. summer projects are an incredible resource as it is, but the question is should they be created by the students? or the Teachers? summer projects should be teacher-designed because summer-time can be very busy for students, teachers know the best information to feed students for the following year, and It will make students more obligated to complete them.

Some people may argue that students will be more enthusiastic about school projects if they get to choose the topics themselves. However, students need guidance or else the will not make them a priority. Instead of it feeling like school work it will feel like a side project that doesn't really matter. For example, my cousin goes to a private school where they allow the students to choose their summer projects. He got an F on all of them simply because he did not feel like he it was a priority and pushed it off until the very last minute.

Students are WAY to busy in the summer to create their own projects in the summer. One reason is that most students get summer jobs which take up a lot of their time. For example my friend Generic_Name is a Full Time Life Guard. he works 40 hours a week. He would have not have enough time to design a whole project and work a full time job without putting himself into serious mental strain. It is hard to balance out that much. Another point is that many people go on vacation with their families during summer. For example, my mother and I go on vacation to Generic_City every summer. This is important because people want to use the extra time they have when not doing the project and spend it with their families. Not making spending it creating the project they have to complete.

Teachers know the best information to give you to prepare you for next year. If school projects are student-designed, students won't cover material that will set them up for success. It's a teachers job to prepare you on what is to come, so why not let them do it? the school projects will become irrelevant simply because they are going to cover topics that will benefit them in the long run. They are not going to take seriously.

Students will feel more obligated to complete the projects if they are created by teachers. If students are given the freedom to just do the whole thing on their own, they will nine times out of ten just not do it at all. The reason for this is because it does would not feel like school work therefore it will not feel important. an example of this is after school activities like theater. In theater you are given things to memorize at home, but some people do not do it simply because they feel it is not as important as other things they could be doing. They are not prioritizing and that is exactly what will happen if we make summer projects students designed; people will not not feel obligated to do it there they won't.

To wrap it all up summer projects truly should be teacher- designed. Summer activities take up a lot of these kids time, so they will not have time to create them on their own. Also teachers know what the best things are to assign to help them with the next school year. Finally students need to be guided so that they will prioritize their summer work.

This happened during one of Viking 1 missions to look for a landing site for his sister ship, Viking 2. Scientists guessed it to be another ""Martian messa"", which was common in the region of Cydonia.

B87D59512568,"Asking for advice is a crucial part of making a big decision. Many people ask for second opinions when they don't know what they should do, or can't decide on their own. When you as a decision maker do this, it benefits you by giving you a chance to learn from the experience of others, view your situation in a different perspective, and learn more about your choices. All of these are valuable assets that will help you later in life, and maybe even help others if they come to you for advice. Experience is one benefit that definitely will help later on.

The main reason everyone asks for a second opinion is for experience. People who have had to make your decision before will have experience with what happened to them when they made the decision. This will help you try to find the result that will best benefit you. My friend Generic_Name always asks for the opinion of others when trying to make a decision. A great example of this is when she couldn't take a important test, but didn't know when she should make it up. She asked me what she should do, and I told her that when I missed a big test, I tried to find a solution with our teacher beforehand, like taking the test early, or a few days after the actual test date. Generic_Name knew she couldn't take the test early, as she had another activity taking up her time, but she went to our teacher and asked if she could take it later. Generic_Name figured out a solution by asking others for advice, and found the best choice for her using my experience. Now, she can also use both mine and her experience to make decisions later on inn life. Using my experience to find a solution is not the only way for Generic_Name to solve her problem though. She could have asked for a different perspective instead.

Advice from others come in many forms, but most come in the form of a different perspective. Different perspectives help others understand your problem so they can help you, and also you can now rearrange the pieces of your situation to find a solution. It's always better to look at your choices in a new perspective, because you might find it easier to choose the best one for you from that angle. When I was trying to decide which sleep-away camp I wanted to attend this summer, I had to ask my parents and my friends to decide. My parents told me that because one of the camps was extremely expensive, it would be better for me to go to the other one. My friends, on the other hand, told me that instead of choosing one or the other, I should go to a completely different camp, one that has the activities of both previous camps mentioned and cost less than each one. I did not know about this camp, and didn't even consider trying to find a camp with the benefits of both the ones I wanted to attend. But using my friends' wider perspectives, I was able to find a completely new and customized solution for me. They also could have provided important information about the new camp that I was not aware of to advise me on my decision.

Information is a big asset when making a decision, and you can get that information by asking for advice from others. Different people may know certain things about the decision that you need to make. Asking for advice from these people will allow you to gain this information and make a better choice. A study from Harvard University found that when given the choice, 99% of people chose to make a decision with advice from multiple strangers who has had to make the same decision before. Out of that 99%, 98% believed that the choice they made was the best for them. They also believed that the knowledge they gained from talking to the strangers was a big contributing factor to their success. This study shows how truly beneficial advice from others is. It not only helped people make the best decision possible, but also provided new information for the decision maker, who can now pass on that knowledge to others who need help from someone with experience.

In conclusion, when making a decision, asking for multiple opinions is extremely beneficial. You can learn from the experience of others, choose the right choice more easily when looking at different solutions in a new perspective, and gain new information you can pass on to others, thus helping the whole process come full circle. It will benefit you greatly in the long run as well, as you can use anything you gain from these different opinions in future decision making processes. Clearly, it is always better for you to ask for a second opinion, no matter the decision.",0,0.010014175,0,True

I think they would like the rule because they would use them in lunch and in free time, but they would take advantage of the rule. For example after a test when the teacher gives you time to read or do your homework, I think that's when kids would use them. They would use them when a teacher is not looking, or even when the teacher is teaching. I think most kids would like this rule because they would be aloud to use there phones and not get in trouble. I think if they were aloud they would not under stand what the teacher is telling them to do, maybe the schools average on tests would go down if this happens.

04B6F07AC0EC,"Have you ever talked to your friend about something and he Disagrees with your advice while you might think he's advice isn't valid but people have their own opinion and some can change your thinking.:This article I will show you why multiple Opinions are just better than one , first giving multiple opinions can Reduce bad behavior, second multiple opinions can show you things you didnt know you had. Thirdly Multiple opinions are just better because 3 brains are better than one.

Multiple opinions can reduce bad behavior, because if you are looking for an advice and you listened to an advice you like you will stick to it. A example, someone tells you to cheat on a big test and your ready to do it when someone overhears you and say don't do it there is always a better solution than cheating and starts listing out facts and this other opinion can make a huge difference in your outcome and change your perceptive to cheating on a test. Personally I have dealt with bad advice but I always have good friends/family to stop me from doing bad things so this passage can show you why opinions are really important.

Why multiple opinions can show you things you didn't know you have ,to elaborate my personal experiences have shown that some of my advice that I get are pretty bad and some other advice can make you learn and broaden your horizons. A personal example of mine is when I was bored at home and my friends told me to either make some food for them or go out and play and i reluctantly made the food, when I did make the food it turned out great. When that happened I started cooking more and now its a hobby I loved that I never knew I had. This show that multiple opinions can show you things you didnt know you have.

Why multiple opinions are just better because 3 brains are better than one, in more depth multiple opinions can separate bias nous because other peoples opinion can have different ideology. If you did survey 3 people for advice on getting good grades probably the things they would have said was pay attention in class, do homework etc while there might be that one guy that says just cheat and don't listen in class. If this does happen you might think who is bias here while it depends on your standpoint if you already support cheating you will pick that guy so that will be bias but have you ever thought that maybe just paying attention and studying would help. If you did take that route you will have multiple opinions to lye on and that can overall dissipate bias nous and also you can switch stand point to see whats right for you. This can show your route what stand point you like.

After all of this I support my claim and my thesis multiple opinions can Reduce bad behavior, multiple opinions can show you things that you didn't know you had, Multiple opinions are just better because 3 brains are better than one. Multiple opinions can change your life for the better, If you give people opinions I hope Its good ones and I hope to see that people that are reading this implement it into their lives .",0,0.0077919597,0,True

Hello dear president, my name is Nathan and I think it's already time to admit that the Electoral college system should always be part of our government.

The electoral college process was established by the founding fathers in order to settle an important compromise in our nation. This electoral process consists of regulating the way in which our nation will decide who will be the next president. Consisting of 538 electors, a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. This system allows the most experienced people to choose the future of the nation, and changing it to anything else would slowly cause the whole federal system to collapse. The electoral college method may not seem democratic in a modern sense, because it's actually very unique. This method turn off potential voters for a reason; The candidate that must be chosen is the most prepared one. There is so many factors related to the immense amout of security the college electoral process brings to our people that changing this precise system would be like deciding to turn off the country. Choosing an unprepared president will potentially cause the economy to break, civil wars involving every state, protests, and our nation's reputation to die. It was also revealed this year that in the states in which education is one of the main investments, nearly 90% of the people were in favor of the keeping the system the way it is. The electoral college method is professionalism at it's highest level, and any other different system is clearly inferior to it.

It's politically notable how the nation is reacting to this possible change with disappointment and sadness. I hope you as the leader of the people we all love, will understand the amount of value put in this constitution, and notice that changing it would be catastrophic.

0F13DFDE31B5,"""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.""

This statement would lead anyone to believe that the details and magnification in a camera 25 years younger and improved would lead to better and more eye capsuring photos right?

Right.

So, why would there be controversey over the likelyhood of the face actually being real?

Here's why: people see something one time and they are automatically drawn into the idea that it has to be real. The Martian Mesa was said to look like a Egyptian Pharaoh. That statement leads people to believe that there had to be life to build something like that. But, with the shadow showing groves perfectly and the holes in the mesa made it look real. The ""Face"" is just another Mesa on Mars.

First, the pixels and the picture produced by the camera at that time weren't as developed as the camera used in 2001. You also have to take into account that, as time goes on, most products will be improved and made better, in this case that's how it was with the cameras, with a 25 year gap in between.

The text says, ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos."" The text also supports the claim by stating, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.""

Additionally, the shadows had appeared to be hitting the natural landform just right. The scientists belive this because, they have seen many other mesas while traveling in space, this on just happened to have a interesting impression at first sight.

The text proves this by including, ""A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a ""huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusoin of eyes, nose, and mouth.""

The text also says, There must have been a degree of spurise amoung mission controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab when the face appeared on their monitors. But the sensation was short lived. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia only this had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.""

Believers in this ""face"" may claim there was never a clear picture of the ""face"" taken after the first photo.

To support this they may think that the photographer taking the picture may not be able to see the clouds. The text says, ""But not everyone was satisfied. The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98 - a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to the Face.""

However, NASA was able to take another picture of the Face when the clouds weren't in the way and it wasn't winter. The text says, ""Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001 - a cloudless summer day in Cydonia - MGS drew close enough for a second look. What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa.""

The Face captured on Mars has proven to be a natural landform. With shadows covering it and dips to make facial features it can across as an Egyptian Pharaoh. This is proven because, of the high tech cameras and the shadows only lasted one day allowed scientists to prove their claim - the Face was just a normal mesa landform.",0,0.007234243,0,True

however this might also confuse people as the advice could either blend in or sound not good at all. sometimes speaking to only one person is better as you have one plan and can think if it will work or not. not all plans will work as they might only work for a specific thing. also don't always rely on other peoples ideas as they might not be around when you need them. but asking for others advice is a good way to solve something if your having trouble with something.

asking multiple people can be a even better help as you have more plans and have more to go off of than just one. asking more people also means you have more support. doing this like this can help you with a essay, a book, a movie, a game or a speech. you can however just solve the problem by yourself as other peoples advice might not work out for you. you have to remember that going around asking people for advice might not always be the best solution.

some people can't find solutions that easily by themselves so thats why asking others can be a good backup option. it can also be helpful if your doing something you don't know how to do but there are people around you who do. for some people however they don't have this option because of things like them being antisocial or them not being able to talk. others might just not like talking to people they don't know. others however might have this self pride and not want any help.

asking others for advice might also be a bit annoying. you might not find anyone who can give advice. there is also the possibility that everyone has the same advice but it's not good for what your trying to do. even with all of those problems asking for advice is a very good thing to do. so if your finding something hard or frustrating just ask someone for help.",0,0.0077974396,0,True
E215400764F3,"Have you ever received the most boring Summer assignment from a teacher and waited till the last week to do it? Many would answer yes. Summer projects are designed to allow for a child to continue to grow cognitively, while away from a continuous study at school. However, many fail to consider that kids are still on Summer break, resulting in fun activities rather than working on a project due 3 months away. In order for Summer projects to succeed, they should be student-designed to ensure engagement within the project, allow them to grow in a field of interest, and give the students an opportunity to express themselves.

Keeping students engaged in a Summer project is critical to the success of the assignments. A student is more likely to spend more time on a project that they are interest in, rather than completing required tasks that they don't want to do. Enacting student-designed projects allows for them to voice what they are likely to do that will keep them engaged in a learning activity. This allows the students to feel control over their Summer, and how they may want to incorporate learning into a fun growing experience. While they may voice their thoughts, they will also have a better understanding on what exactly to do for their project ahead of time keeping them engaged in whatever they need to accomplish. Providing a platform for students to express their ideas, leads to engagement and a product that succeeds the purpose.

For many students, their engagement in an activity comes from the topic, allowing them to have freedom as to what they create, helps them further their mind. This also allows for fun because they are more engaged based on their topic choice. Many people say that they are prone to doing better on an assignment involving a topic of interest because they care more about the product. Student's who care about a topic will give you a product that means something to them, expressing their creativity and effort that they put into an assignment. Lastly, these projects are designed to cognitively grow and maintain a child's mind over break. Learning about themselves is one of the most important ways of doing that; by allowing them to design their own project and have freedom as to what they want to do, you are allowing an opportunity for them to find out what they are interested in and understand more about themselves.

Finally, Summer is defined in a kid's mind to be a time of enjoyment and relaxation after a dwelling school year. With these Summer projects they should be associated with a similar thought. Student's designing their own project will allow for a creative outlook and give them an opportunity to create a better project than a poster board. Creativity proves to be effective in allowing for more growth than ever about how you may want to present what you learned over a break. Also when allowing a student to express creativity you are creating opportunity for them to incorporate something unique into their assignment which will further their engagement and growth.

In all, Summer projects would be more effective and beneficial to student's if they were designed by student's themselves based on an increase of interest, opportunity to grow in a field of interest, and ability to incorporate a personable and creative outlook. Student's will feel empowered and confident in their assignment by self-designing an opportunity to grow themselves. Overall the result and product will be more detailed and purposeful when engaging a student in something they enjoy while allowing growth in their self as well as their minds. ",0,0.009573876,0,True

6C2348EA83BB,"Dear, state senator I think changing elections by popular vote for the president of the United States would be better. Each candidate had his or her group of electors. Mostly the political party like Democratic and Republican. he Electoral college is the established Constitution as a compromise between electionof the presdident by vote in congress. Popular votes for the election of the president is more meaningful then having 538 electors and 270 electoral votes. I think the electoral college doesn't work.

In the electoral college system,voters just vote for the president, but along with that your voting for more electors in their political party. This is a very big deal for the people voting in elections. They have no control of whom their electors votr for. The electoral college is also unfair to the canidates because the winner-take-all system in each state. The best arguments in favor is the popular vote, but some canidates still lose from the presidency.

Looking at the breakdown of the number of electoral votes given to each state-California has the most votes. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. or instance, as Romney was in the South he had no campaign heavily in those states. He gained no electoral votes. In toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign-to really take notice inthe competing canidates. Those voters sre the ones to decide the election. Run-Off elections should be avoided, it would greatly complicate the presidential election process.

My advice to you;as the state senator is to not keep the Electoral College. The election of the populae vote would be more precised. It's maybe 1% unfair because in states like california they have like 55,000 republicans voting for 1 canidate. And if there's a tie in the electoral vote, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president.                                                            ",0,0.0070768404,0,True

I honestly think that isn't fair because the students who contain a C average might not have a good chance to get a higher grade for instance, if a child has an abusive step parent and get bullied at school do you honestly think that child can focus on their school work. No, he can't, he's to afraid he might get his butt kicked if the teachers leaves to use the restroom. That's one example look at this one, what if the child is mentally disturbed and suffers from ADHD That child might also be very good at sports because of his hyper-ness. That child might have a chance to become a millionaire, but if you pass this new policy you could hurt that child's chances. This is another good example, I'm sure as a principle you should know that some students are better at sports than others, and some are better at ""books"" then others. A child might be phenomenal at sports but maintain a D average. Like i stated earlier he could have abuse issues, focusing issues, hormone issues, or even sexual issues that stop him from thinking straight.

In conclusion if this policy is passed you as a principle would have to deal with a lot of complaints mad by parents and students. You might also end up stopping someone from achieving a life long goal and have stress knowing that you caused this.",0,0.0073081725,0,True
063D5478D82F,"When I was younger, I remember being in a lot of extracurricular activities. Whenever I joined an extracurricular activities, I would learn something new about myself. Also, I would make a lot of new amazing friends when I was in these extracurricular activities who are still my friends to this day. Thats why I agree with the principal's decision because students could learn new things about themselves and its a great way for students to meet new people.

One reason why students should be in extracurricular activities is because students can learn new things about themselves if they join extracurricular activities. When students learn new things about themselves, they can turn that knowledge into goals for future jobs. For example, if a student joins the school basket ball team, then that student might have a goal to join a professional basketball team. Another example is my friend is in a coding class, she learned how much she likes coding that she has a goal to work at Microsoft. By making students join extracurricular activities, students will learn new things about themselves.

Another reason why students should do extracurricular activities is because students can meet new people in them. These new people can turn into a new friend or even a soul mate. For example, when I was in Home Economics, I made many fantastic friends who are still my friends today. Without Home Economics, I probably wouldnt have made them my friends. By making students join extracurricular activities, the students can meet new people.

In conclusion, I believe that students should do at least one extracurricular activity. These extracurricular activities can help students learn more about themselves which could give them goals for jobs in the future. They can also help students meet new people which can turn into friendships being made and new couples being made. I hope that other people consider that students should do at least one extracurricular activity.",0,0.0080088265,0,True
9e7b420d,"I wholeheartedly believe the United States should keep the electoral College because the people voting are more legit, the voters are more educated in government topics than most, and citizens still have a say in the vote. Some citizens need to realize that electing a president is a big deal. Electors have more knowledge than most citizens about those government choices and which is best for The United States. Just because it says a citizen is qualified to vote does not always mean that person is making the correct decision. The electoral college electors uses their votes on legit reasons and what can benefit their country.

Electoral College is the way to go because the people voting are more legit. These Electors see what the people who are running for president and vice president have to offer. If they feel it is more beneficial than what the other presidentvice president has to offer, they will vote for that president. Most citizens understand what the president and vice president is trying to do for their country but the other citizens who are only voting because they can, do not. These citizens still effect the elect of the president and vice president and that's why the electoral college is a must have.

Electors are usually more educated in government topics than most citizens. The electors are people from the House of Representatives and Senators also. For those Representatives and those Senators to get there, they study about the United States and it's government. When Presidents and Vice presidents state what they are willing to do for the country, those electors know if it is appropriate and necessary and which one makes more sense or benefits the country more than the other. Not that Citizens would understand the best choice for the country but more likely than not an electors would make a more educated choice than a citizen would.

Even though the electors are voting, Citizens vote still count and matter. Citizens vote for the elector who is voting for the president that the citizens wants to vote for. A citizen can vote for a certain amount of electors who pledged to vote for the desired President and Vice President. If those electors won the statewide election, that desired President and Vice president would get those certain amount of electoral votes. It all depends on the citizens to choose the electors and whoever gets the majority vote, gets the electoral votes.

In Conclusion, the electoral college definitely should stay and help choose the better President and Vice President. The electors have a more legit reason to their choice than most citizens voting, since the electors are based on Representatives and Senators, they are more educated in that government matter, and even though it is electoral votes, the citizens vote count and matter. Without the electoral college, citizens who voted for a president can lose because the people who voted for the other president didn't think about the advantage and disadvantage of that president. Even if it was the better choice, the president can have ideas that don't benefit the voter.

To start of this discusion of the so called ""face"" on mars I would like to tell you is that it is not at all a face. What it is just a landform that has formed to look so simular to a face or moument of the martians. But mars is like earth it forms things just like it so what it really is is just a couple of rocks and thier shadows to form a face like thing.

On the other hand is how do we know this. Well ever since the discovery scientist have been researching and taking more pictures and looking at it a whole lot closer. What we came up with is that like I said before a landform on mars but some say where wrong.

Another reason that bothers me is how people think its a conspiracy theory. many, many, many people think ""oh its just nothing but the martians"" but no this is just a mesa but since people say that stuff we had to prove them wrong. So what NASA did was they built a big camera to take pictures of it to prove it was a big rock which it was a huge budget problem for them but they still did it.

I would be beyond upset and I bet other students will too! Personally I don't think it's a good idea. But who am I to judge other people's opinion's. So i'm going to just state some reasons why this not a good idea.

First Reason is that many students want a long break from school. And I mean a LONG break from it. The reason to this is because, we get stressed, tired, drowsy, and even suffer from all the studying and work we do year around. And this can cause depression in teens as well, and trust me I know that feeling it sucks. But anyways back on topic. And for the educators that said we should get longer winter breaks and spring breaks it sounds like a good idea but it just doesn't make sense to me in my opinion.

Second Reason is that students spend more time with family and friends! The reason for this is that students don't have time to spend time with them because the're either doing school work or the're to tired to even talk so they go to sleep early because of how tired they are. And when you are tired you feel grumpy and disturbed by everything so it's better off just going to sleep rather than talking to family and friends because, all your going to bring is negative energy and no one wants that.

Final Reason is that summer break is basically like a reward for students that made it through the year. A nice 3 months without work, stress free, relaxation, and do whatever you want and 3-4 weeks is not enough for us to be honest we need a good long break from it because we just need a little time to relax. And when September arrives it will be a fresh start and are minds will be clear and ready again too do more work.

C865637A034A,"Online schooling is a relatively new concept that has gained popularity in recent years due to its numerous benefits. As an 8th grader, I believe that online schooling can greatly impact a student's academic performance in a positive way.

Firstly, one of the most significant advantages of online schooling is the decreased distractions. Traditional classrooms can be noisy and chaotic, making it difficult for students to focus on their studies. In contrast, online schooling allows students to learn in a quiet and peaceful environment, free from distractions such as classroom chatter and interruptions. This can lead to better concentration and improved academic performance.

Another benefit of online schooling is the ability to work at one's own pace. Every student learns at their own pace, and online schooling allows them to do just that. Students can take as much time as they need to understand a concept, and they can repeat it as many times as they want until they feel comfortable moving on to the next topic. This can be particularly helpful for students who struggle with certain subjects or who need extra time to comprehend the material.

Moreover, online schooling can also provide better sleeping schedules. Traditional classrooms often require students to attend school during specific hours, which can result in late nights and early mornings. This can lead to sleep deprivation, which can negatively impact academic performance. Online schooling, on the other hand, allows students to learn at any time of the day or night, providing them with more flexibility and control over their schedules.

Finally, online schooling is more convenient than traditional schooling. Students can access their course materials and assignments from anywhere with an internet connection, making it easier to balance schoolwork with other responsibilities such as extracurricular activities or part-time jobs. This can help students to manage their time more effectively and reduce the stress that comes with juggling multiple commitments.

In conclusion, the benefits of online schooling, such as decreased distractions, ability to work at one's own pace, better sleeping schedules, and more convenience, can positively impact a student's academic performance.

D7766B98F761,"Hey, ya'll! Today, I'm gonna talk about how having a positive attitude is super important in life. Like, it's really crucial. If you have a positive attitude, people are more likely to want to be around you and stuff. And, like, if you're always grumpy and stuff, people might think you're weird or something. (Sorry, I know that's not a great example, but you get what I mean, right?)

So, like, having a positive attitude can totally affect your reputation. If you're always smiling and stuff, people are gonna think you're cool and fun to be around. And, like, who doesn't want that? I mean, who wants to be known as the grumpy kid in class? Not me, that's for sure! (Sorry, I'm being a bit dramatic, but you get my point, right?)

But, like, it's not just about your reputation. Having a positive attitude can also help others. If you're always spreading positivity and happiness, it can rub off on the people around you. Like, imagine if you're in a bad mood and someone's always making you laugh and stuff. It can totally change your day, right? And, like, if you're always making others feel better, you're gonna feel better too. It's like this whole cycle of positivity, and it's so cool!

And, like, let's talk about mindset. Having a positive attitude can totally change the way you think about things. If you're always thinking positive thoughts, you're gonna be more likely to take risks and try new things. And, like, that's so important in life. Like, if you're always stuck in this negative mindset, you're gonna miss out on so much. But, like, if you're always thinking positive, you're gonna be more open to new experiences and stuff.

I mean, I get that some people might say it helps us learn and stuff, but I don't think it does. It just makes us stress out and not want to learn.

For example, last night I had to do this stupid math homework that took me forever. I was up until like 11 pm doing it and I was so tired. I didn't even understand what I was doing, I was just doing it because I had to. It wasn't like I was learning anything. And then today in class, we had to take a test and I did horrible on it because I was so tired from staying up late doing homework. So, that just proves that homework doesn't help us learn.

Another thing is, homework takes up all my free time. I like to play video games and hang out with my friends, but I can't because I have to do homework. It's not fair. We should have more time to do what we want to do, not what teachers want us to do.

Also, homework is not always relevant to our lives. Like, I'm never going to use calculus in my life, so why do I have to learn it? It's a waste of time. We should be learning things that we're actually going to use in our lives, like how to do taxes or how to buy a house. That would be more helpful.

In conclusion, homework is a waste of time and it's not helpful. We should focus on learning things that are relevant to our lives and not stress ourselves out with unnecessary homework.

On the other hand, schools controlling a student's participation in extracurricular activities can bring an element of structure to the student's life and ensure that activities are consistent with the school's values and goals. While this approach may help students discover new interests or discover a career path, it does limit a student's potential to explore and develop their own passions.

First,  it's important to do your homework and turn it in on time. I know it can be hard to stay on top of it, but trust me, it's worth it. If you don't do your homework, you might get caught and get in trouble. And if you don't turn it in on time, you might get a bad grade, which can also lead to trouble. So, like, make sure you're staying on top of your homework and getting it done before class. That way, you can focus on learning instead of worrying about getting in trouble.

Second,  it's important to be respectful to your teachers and classmates. I know it can be easy to get distracted or get into a fight with someone, but it's important to keep your cool and be nice to everyone.

However, there are some potential drawbacks to consider, including stress and a lack of elective classes. 

On the positive side, finishing high school early allows students to save time and energy during a crucial period in their developmental years, allowing them to focus more directly on other pursuits. In addition, leaving high school early can give students an advantage for college acceptance, scholarships, and internships. Furthermore, those who enter the workforce at an earlier age may have more opportunities for professional development and career advancement, as they have a longer period of time to build their experiences and skills. 

However, finishing high school early can also lead to stress. Students who are in a hurry to finish their courses may not give themselves time to fully digest the material, which can put them at a disadvantage when moving on to the next stage. In addition, students may miss out on certain elective classes if they cannot find enough time in their course load. Many students rely on elective courses to gain knowledge in areas they are passionate about, so this can be a problem if there isn’t sufficient time. 

In conclusion, it is an individual choice whether or not to finish high school early.

First off, let's talk about the environment.  A four-day work week could lead to a reduction in carbon emissions from commuting. Like, think about it. If people are working four days instead of five, they'll be on the road less often, which means less gas guzzled and less pollution in the air. It's like, a win-win for the planet!

In this essay, I will analyze the impact of working in the food industry on one's academic performance, relationship with family and friends, and examine the different kinds of work available. Additionally, I will investigate the benefits of visiting and observing a professional kitchen, and examine the importance of selecting a job that one enjoys.

One of the main advantages of working in the food industry is the flexibility it offers. Many jobs in the food industry, such as working at a fast food restaurant or as a caterer, allow for flexible schedules that can accommodate the needs of students. This can be especially beneficial for students who have other commitments, such as school or extracurricular activities.

However, working in the food industry can also have a negative impact on one's academic performance. The long hours and fast-paced environment can make it difficult for students to balance their work and school responsibilities. Additionally, the physical demands of the job can lead to fatigue and a lack of focus, which can negatively impact academic performance.

Working in the food industry can also have an impact on one's relationship with family and friends. The long hours and demanding nature of the job can make it difficult for employees to spend quality time with loved ones. Additionally, the physical demands of the job can lead to injuries or health problems that can make it difficult for employees to participate in family activities.

There are many different kinds of work available in the food industry, from fast food restaurants to fine dining establishments. Each type of work offers its own unique benefits and challenges. For example, working at a fast food restaurant may offer a steady income and the opportunity to learn new skills, but may also involve long hours and a high-stress environment. On the other hand, working in a fine dining establishment may offer a more upscale work environment and the opportunity to work with skilled chefs, but may also involve long hours and a high level of pressure to maintain a high level of service.

With the rise of technology, online learning has become increasingly popular. Students can now attend classes from the comfort of their own home through video conferencing. While there are many benefits to this education option, there are also some disadvantages. In this essay, I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of attending classes from home online or by video conference and provide my opinion on whether it should be available for all students.

Advantages of Online Learning

One of the biggest advantages of attending classes from home online or by video conference is the flexibility it provides. Students can attend class at any time and from any location, as long as they have a stable internet connection. This is especially convenient for students who have other commitments, such as jobs or family responsibilities. Additionally, students can learn at their own pace, which allows them to take more time to understand difficult concepts.

Another advantage of online learning is that it allows for a more personalized learning experience. Teachers can use a variety of multimedia tools, such as videos and interactive simulations, to engage students and make the learning experience more interactive. This can be especially helpful for students who learn better through visual aids.

Disadvantages of Online Learning

While there are many benefits to online learning, there are also some disadvantages. One of the biggest disadvantages is the lack of social interaction. Students who attend classes from home online or by video conference may feel isolated and disconnected from their peers. This can be especially challenging for students who are new to the school or community.

Another disadvantage of online learning is that it can be difficult for students to stay motivated. Without the structure of a traditional classroom, students may struggle to stay on track and complete their assignments. Additionally, students may be more likely to procrastinate and miss deadlines.

My Opinion

In my opinion, online learning should be available for all students, but it should not be the only option. While there are many benefits to attending classes from home online or by video conference, there are also some disadvantages that must be considered. Students who attend classes in person may benefit from the social interaction and structure of a traditional classroom. Additionally, students who struggle with motivation may benefit from the accountability and support provided by a teacher.

One of the most popular post-secondary routes is to go to college to pursue further studies in a given field of interest. This can provide job opportunities in a variety of fields, such as accounting, engineering, and law. The benefits to this include the potential for higher salary prospects, greater job security, and the experience of pursuing more specialized training. On the flip side, there is also the financial commitment and technical aptitude required to complete some of these courses.

Alternately, students can take on an apprenticeship in order to receive on-the-job training in a desired field. This pathway provides the student with the opportunity to gain hands-on experience alongside more experienced professionals and a potential salary while doing so. The potential downsides to this approach are the initially lower wages compared to those of university graduates, and some jobs in this field may be harder to secure and stability may be lower in comparison.

C6DDD966C9FC,"Working together is a highly advantageous solution to overcoming a difficult task. When people come together to collaborate on an issue, the amount of work that needs to be done is reduced significantly because the task is shared amongst multiple individuals. This promotes efficiency as each person is able to focus on their particular area of specialization and build off of each other's ideas and skills to create a comprehensive solution. Working in a group also creates opportunities to utilize different skill sets, such as problem-solving, organization and communication, that would be difficult to accomplish alone.

Furthermore, working together provides the benefit of constructive criticism. When several people collaborate on a project, they each have a unique perspective and can offer valuable feedback to enhance the end result. This is especially beneficial for students, as they can learn from one another and develop more effective problem-solving skills. 

While working together does have its benefits, it can also be a double-edged sword. For certain tasks, working on your own can allow for uninterrupted focus which can lead to faster results. It can also be difficult to come to an agreement with a group of people, and the amount of energy that goes into discussing ideas can be draining.

Overall, the importance of collaboration cannot be overstated. While there are certainly times when working alone can be beneficial, the power of team work and diversity should not be underestimated.

There are numerous benefits of using alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, cycling or taking public transport. First and foremost, it is an effective way to decrease air pollution and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are the major source of pollutants that cause smog, which has harmful effects on our health and environment.

Moreover, limiting car usage can improve traffic flow and ease congestion. It can also help in reducing traffic accidents and fatalities, and increase the lifespan of our roads, which in turn saves money for the government and taxpayers.

Using cars less frequently can also lead to healthier lifestyles as walking, cycling and public transport involve some physical activity. This helps in reducing obesity, heart diseases and other related illnesses.

Furthermore, alternative modes of transportation are cheaper and save money for individuals in the long run. Owning a car involves a lot of additional expenses such as fuel, insurance, maintenance, and parking, while taking public transportation or cycling can save money on transportation expenses.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can bring a positive change in our society and environment.

One pro is that they can help us figure out what we're actually interested in. Like, if I never took a art class in middle school, I might still think I want to be an artist when I grow up. But, after that class, I realized I'm more into drawing and painting, you know? So, it's good to have those options.

Another pro is that they can help us develop new skills. Like, if I take a cooking class, I'll learn how to make different dishes and maybe even start my own food truck one day. Or, if I take a coding class, I'll learn how to make apps and websites, which can be really useful in the future.

But, there are also cons. One con is that they can be distracting. Like, if I'm supposed to be studying for a math test, but I'm also in a drama club, I might get distracted and forget about the math. Or, if I'm in a sports class, I might get so into it that I forget about my other classes. That can be bad.

And, some people might not be interested in the elective classes they're offered. Like, if I'm not into sports, but I have to take a sports class, I might get bored and not pay attention. Or, if I'm not into music, but I have to take a music class, I might not learn anything. That's why it's good to have choices, you know?

But, research shows that taking elective classes can have educational benefits. Like, studies have shown that students who take elective classes are more likely to do well in school and have better grades. And, they're more likely to go to college too.

But we should also make sure that we're not hurting the animals too much. We should use the minimum number of animals needed and make sure they're treated well. We shouldn't just use them and throw them away like trash. That's not right.

And also, we should try to find alternative ways to do research without using animals. Like, we could use cells or computer models or something. That way, we're not hurting anyone or anything.

Subject: The Importance of Keeping the Electoral College System

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my strong support for keeping the Electoral College system in the United States or, alternatively, changing to an election by popular vote for the President. The Electoral College, established by our founding fathers as a compromise between Congress and popular vote, has served our country well for over two centuries. While it is crucial for our democracy to evolve and adapt to the changing times, I believe the Electoral College should be preserved due to its many advantages, as explained in the texts I have studied.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures a certain outcome and minimizes disputes over the election results. In the 2012 election, President Obama won 61.7 percent of the electoral vote, even though his share of the popular vote was only 51.3 percent. This demonstrates that the Electoral College provides a clear winner by making a candidate's victory in each state translate into a comprehensive electoral-vote victory. The certainty of outcome offered by this system is essential for a stable transfer of power.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system ensures that the elected President represents the interests of diverse regions. A successful president must have trans-regional appeal rather than relying solely on regional support. By requiring candidates to gain support across various states, the Electoral College fosters national unity and prevents presidents from focusing solely on policies benefiting their strongholds. This balances the interests of all regions, ensuring that no state or group of states becomes marginalized.

The Electoral College also encourages candidates to engage with citizens in swing states, ensuring that voters' voices are heard. In a nation as diverse as ours, it is crucial that candidates reach out to voters in states that might be undecided. This system guarantees that citizens in these swing states receive substantial attention, allowing them to make informed choices based on various candidates' policies and qualifications. In doing so, the Electoral College promotes an engaged and informed electorate.

Additionally, the Electoral College provides balance to the political influence of large and small states. In a country where population sizes vary, the Electoral College allows large states to maintain influence by allocating more electoral votes to them. This balance is crucial, as it prevents sparsely populated states from being overshadowed by densely populated states in the electoral process. By preserving this balance, the Electoral College ensures that every state remains important in electing the President.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections by producing a clear winner. In cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote, as in the elections of Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992, the Electoral College has prevented the need for costly and time-consuming run-off elections. This efficient and decisive nature of the Electoral College system aids in the smooth functioning of our democratic process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system has stood the test of time and continues to provide numerous advantages for our democracy. It ensures a certain outcome, promotes national unity, encourages candidates to engage with citizens in swing states, provides balance to the influence of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. These reasons, as outlined in the texts I have studied, make a strong case for retaining the Electoral College system or changing to an election by popular vote. I urge you to consider these arguments when discussing any proposals related to electoral reform.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will give careful consideration to the points raised in this letter. Our democracy is dependent on thoughtful decision-making, and I hope you will support the continued use of the Electoral College system or a viable alternative.

Sincerely,

When faced with an intruder in a lockdown situation, students should look for objects to throw that are heavier than their textbooks. This can include heavy lamps or furniture. When faced with a fire drill, students should quickly gather any valuables or necessary items, then proceed calmly and quickly to the nearest exit. When an earthquake hits, students should stay low to the ground and move away from any heavy furniture or objects that could fall. Additionally, if students are in a building, it is important for them to cover their head and neck with their hand or a jacket until the shaking stops.

llama_70b_v11037,"Hey there! So, like, when people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person, right? And that's actually a pretty smart thing to do. See, when you're trying to make a big decision, it's important to get as much info as possible, and getting multiple opinions can really help with that.

First off, let's talk about why one person's opinion might not be enough. Like, imagine you're trying to decide which college to go to. Your best friend might have an opinion, but they might not know everything about the different schools. They might not have looked into the programs or the cost or the location, so their advice might not be super helpful. But, if you ask a few different people who have gone to different colleges, they can give you a better idea of what to expect.

Another reason why seeking multiple opinions is a good idea is that people have different perspectives. Like, your parents might have a different opinion than your friends, and that's okay! They might have more life experience, so they might be able to give you some good advice. But, like, your friends might know you better and know what you're looking for in a college. So, by talking to both your parents and your friends, you can get a more well-rounded view of your options.

And finally, seeking multiple opinions can help you avoid confirmation bias. That's when you only listen to people who agree with you, and you don't consider other viewpoints. It's easy to do that, especially when you're really set on a certain decision. But, if you talk to multiple people, you're more likely to hear different opinions and consider them, even if they don't match what you thought you wanted.

So, in conclusion, seeking multiple opinions can really help you make a better choice. It gives you more information, different perspectives, and helps you avoid confirmation bias. Just remember, it's always a good idea to talk to more than one person when you're trying to make a big decision!",1,0.99422556,1,True
E47A7E497F78,"As an eighth-grade student, I have seen firsthand the power of a small act of kindness. Whether it's a smile, a compliment, or a helping hand, these small gestures can have a huge impact on people's lives. In this essay, I will explore the significance of a single act of kindness and how it can change the course of someone's day.

One of the most significant ways that a small act of kindness can impact someone's life is through their mental health. A simple act of kindness, such as a compliment or a hug, can make someone feel seen and valued. This can be especially important for people who are struggling with feelings of isolation or depression. When someone feels like they are not valued or appreciated, it can be difficult for them to see the bright side of things. However, a small act of kindness can help to break through these negative thoughts and provide a glimmer of hope.

Another way that a small act of kindness can impact someone's life is through their relationships. When someone does something kind for someone else, it can create a bond between them. This can be especially important for people who are new to a community or who are struggling to make friends. A small act of kindness can help to break the ice and create a foundation for a stronger relationship.

Finally, a small act of kindness can also have a significant impact on someone's physical health. When someone is stressed or anxious, it can take a toll on their physical health. This can manifest in a variety of ways, including headaches, stomachaches, and even chronic illnesses. However, a small act of kindness can help to reduce stress and anxiety, which can in turn improve someone's physical health.

In conclusion, a small act of kindness can have a huge impact on someone's life. Whether it's through their mental health, relationships, or physical health, a small act of kindness can make all the difference. As an eighth-grade student, I encourage all of my peers to practice kindness in their daily lives. Even small gestures, such as a smile or a compliment, can make a big difference.",1,0.9946095,1,True

I am writing to express my strong opposition to the school board's decision to add one and a half hours of school each day. While I understand the importance of education, I believe that this decision will negatively affect students in various ways. In this essay, I will provide examples of how it will impact students' sleep schedules and extracurricular activities, and explain why seven hours of school is enough for students to learn.

Firstly, I believe that adding one and a half hours of school each day will negatively affect students' sleep schedules. As an eighth-grade student, I already struggle to get enough sleep each night. With the increased school hours, I am worried that I will not be able to get enough rest, which will affect my academic performance and overall well-being. Furthermore, studies have shown that lack of sleep can lead to decreased cognitive function, increased stress, and even depression. Therefore, I believe that it is crucial to maintain a balance between school and personal life, and adding one and a half hours of school each day will disrupt this balance.

Secondly, I believe that the increased school hours will negatively affect students' extracurricular activities. Many students participate in sports, music, and other extracurricular activities that require a significant time commitment. With the added school hours, I am worried that students will not have enough time to participate in these activities, which will limit their opportunities for personal growth and development. Furthermore, extracurricular activities are essential for building social skills, teamwork, and leadership, which are all valuable skills for future success. Therefore, I believe that it is crucial to maintain a balance between school and extracurricular activities, and adding one and a half hours of school each day will disrupt this balance.

Lastly, I believe that seven hours of school is enough for students to learn. While education is essential, I believe that students can still learn and grow effectively in seven hours of school each day. Studies have shown that the quality of learning is more important than the quantity of time spent in school. Furthermore, many students learn best through hands-on activities, group projects, and other interactive learning methods, which can be effectively implemented in seven hours of school each day.

Doing something is always better than doing nothing. It's easy to get caught up in the idea of just sitting around and doing nothing, but the truth is, it's important to be proactive and take action towards your goals. When you do something, you're not just passing time, you're making progress towards what you want to achieve.

One of the biggest benefits of doing something is that it can help you build momentum. When you take action towards your goals, you start to see results, and that can give you the motivation to keep going. For example, if you want to improve your grades, studying for a test or doing homework can help you see your progress and feel a sense of accomplishment, which can motivate you to keep working hard.

Another benefit of doing something is that it can help you develop new skills and knowledge. When you take on a new challenge or project, you're forced to learn and grow in ways that you might not have otherwise. For example, if you start a new hobby, like playing a musical instrument or learning a new language, you'll have to put in time and effort to get good at it, but the end result can be incredibly rewarding.

Doing something can also help you make better choices in the future. When you're proactive and take action towards your goals, you're more likely to make decisions that align with what you want to achieve. For example, if you want to get into a good college, you might have to make sacrifices and take harder classes in high school to improve your chances of getting accepted. By taking action and making choices that align with your goals, you can set yourself up for success in the future.

In conclusion, doing something is always better than doing nothing. It can help you build momentum, develop new skills and knowledge, and make better choices in the future.

7bb63f0d,"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. This is evident from the various examples provided in the passage set. The suburban community of Vauban in Germany serves as a successful case study for limiting car usage (Rosenthal 1-9). The streets of Vauban are completely car-free, except for the main thoroughfare where the tram runs. Only two places are available for parking, which encourages residents to use alternative modes of transportation like walking or biking. As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move there (Rosenthal 3). This shows that by limiting car usage, residents are adopting healthier and more sustainable lifestyles.

Another example of limiting car usage can be seen in the car-free day initiative in Bogota, Colombia (Selsky 21-28). On this day, millions of Colombians hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work, leaving the streets free from traffic congestion. This promotes alternative transportation methods and reduces smog. The success of this initiative is evident from the positive response it has received, with other cities in Colombia joining the event (Selsky 25). This demonstrates that limiting car usage has the potential to create a cultural shift towards more sustainable transportation choices.

Furthermore, limiting car usage has the potential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions, with passenger cars alone accounting for 12 percent in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States (Rosenthal 5). By limiting car usage, especially in suburban areas, where car dependency is high, it is possible to reduce these emissions and combat climate change. This is supported by the findings that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses, suggesting a shift in behavior towards reducing car dependency (Rosenthal 29-43).

In addition to the environmental benefits of limiting car usage, there are also social and economic advantages. For instance, by making suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation, people can have easier access to basic amenities like stores and services (Rosenthal 6). This reduces the need for long distance travel and reliance on cars. Moreover, limiting car usage can have a positive impact on public health by encouraging physical activity, as seen in Vauban, where people prefer walking or biking instead of driving (Rosenthal 3).

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and include environmental, social, and economic benefits. By adopting policies and initiatives that promote alternative transportation methods and reduce car dependency, societies can create more sustainable and livable communities. The examples provided in the passage set, such as Vauban in Germany and the car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, highlight the potential for successful implementation of such measures. The shift towards reducing car dependency can play a pivotal role in mitigating climate change, improving public health, and creating more accessible and vibrant communities. Therefore, it is crucial for individuals and policymakers to recognize the advantages of limiting car usage and work towards implementing such measures on a larger scale.",1,0.93205893,1,True

Subject: The Importance of the Electoral College in Presidential Elections

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College system currently in place for electing the President of the United States. While some argue in favor of changing to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College should be retained due to its crucial role in maintaining a fair and balanced election process.

The Electoral College was established as a compromise between election by Congress and a popular vote. It consists of 538 electors, with a minimum requirement of 270 electoral votes to elect the President. Each state's allotment of electors is based on the number of representatives it has in Congress. This system ensures that every state, regardless of its size or population, has a say in the election and prevents larger states from dominating the process (Office of the Federal Register).

Contrary to popular belief, the Electoral College rarely results in the winner of the popular vote losing the presidency. In fact, since 1888, this has only occurred once in the 2000 election (Posner, Judge Richard A). This demonstrates that the current system maintains the principle of majority rule while also providing a stable and reliable outcome. Additionally, the Electoral College has been successful in avoiding scenarios where no candidate receives a majority of the votes, thereby preventing the need for costly and time-consuming runoff elections (Posner, Judge Richard A).

Furthermore, the Electoral College promotes the representation of all regions of the country by requiring presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal. Without this requirement, candidates could focus solely on regions where they have the most support, neglecting the interests and voices of other regions (Posner, Judge Richard A). This ensures that the President represents the diverse needs and concerns of the entire nation and not just specific regions.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is the emphasis it places on swing states. Under this system, candidates are incentivized to campaign in states that can swing the outcome of the election, leading to increased voter engagement and attention in these states (Posner, Judge Richard A). This means that swing state voters have a more significant influence on the election, encouraging candidates to address their concerns and issues. Without the Electoral College, candidates would focus only on densely populated areas, leaving the majority of states with little to no attention during the campaign.

Lastly, the Electoral College provides smaller states with a fair share of attention during presidential campaigns. By awarding electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even small states can play a crucial role in the final outcome of the election (Posner, Judge Richard A). It ensures that candidates cannot solely rely on winning the popular vote in large states to secure victory, giving smaller states a voice and influence in the electoral process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a vital component of our democratic system and should be retained. It maintains the principles of representation, regional balance, and majority rule while preventing scenarios of no majority and ensuring all states have an equal say. Changing to a popular vote system would ignore these advantages and potentially lead to unintentional consequences that could compromise the integrity of our presidential elections.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I urge you to consider the importance of the Electoral College and the reasons why it should be preserved for future presidential elections. I trust that you will make the right decision in the best interest of our state and our nation.

Sincerely,

falcon_180b_v1_1034,"In recent years, schools have implemented meditation and mindfulness practices into the school day. While some people believe that these practices can be beneficial for students, I do not believe that they should be included in schools.

Firstly, meditation and mindfulness practices can be seen as religious practices by some. Schools are supposed to be secular institutions, and introducing practices that have religious connotations could be seen as a violation of the separation of church and state. Not all students come from the same religious backgrounds, and it is unfair to force them to participate in practices that do not align with their beliefs.

Secondly, meditation and mindfulness practices can take away from valuable class time. Schools are already struggling to fit in all the necessary curriculum, and taking away time for these practices could put students at a disadvantage. Students need to have a good education in order to succeed in life, and taking away class time for meditation could be detrimental to their future.

Finally, there is no definitive proof that meditation and mindfulness practices actually work. While some people may claim that they have benefited from these practices, there is no scientific evidence to back up these claims. Schools should be focused on teaching proven and effective methods, not unproven practices that could be a waste of time.

AA1ED5376761,"A positive attitude is one of the most important traits that a person can possess. It is the foundation of a successful life and has the power to shape our experiences and opportunities. In this essay, I will argue that having a positive attitude is crucial for achieving success in life and provide evidence to support my claim.

Firstly, a positive attitude allows us to approach challenges with a growth mindset. When we have a positive attitude, we believe that we can overcome obstacles and improve our skills through hard work and dedication. This mindset allows us to take risks and embrace new opportunities, which can lead to greater success. For example, a student with a positive attitude may be more likely to try a new subject or take on a challenging project, which can lead to academic success.

Secondly, a positive attitude can improve our mental and physical health. Research has shown that people with a positive attitude tend to have better overall health and are less likely to experience stress and anxiety. When we are feeling positive, we are more likely to engage in healthy habits such as exercise and proper nutrition, which can lead to physical health benefits. Additionally, a positive attitude can improve our mood and outlook on life, which can have a positive impact on our mental health.

Finally, a positive attitude can improve our relationships with others. When we have a positive attitude, we are more likely to be approachable and empathetic towards others. This can lead to stronger connections and more meaningful relationships. Additionally, people with a positive attitude are more likely to be seen as trustworthy and reliable, which can lead to greater opportunities for collaboration and success.

In conclusion, having a positive attitude is crucial for achieving success in life.

falcon_180b_v1_650,"""With the rise of social media, there has been an increase in the amount of personal information shared online."" This statement is undoubtedly true. Social media has become a ubiquitous aspect of modern life, and the vast majority of people now share personal information on these platforms without a second thought. However, the question of whether or not stronger privacy protections are needed on social media remains a contentious issue.

On one hand, it can be argued that stronger privacy protections are essential to protect individuals from the negative consequences of oversharing. When people share personal information online, they are often unaware of the potential repercussions. For example, a seemingly innocuous post about one's location could be used by criminals to determine when a person's home will be empty. Similarly, sharing too much information about one's personal life could lead to embarrassment or even job loss if the wrong person sees it.

Furthermore, many social media companies have been criticized for their lax privacy policies. These companies often collect vast amounts of data on their users, including their browsing history, location, and even private messages. This data can then be used for targeted advertising or sold to third-party companies without the user's knowledge or consent. Stronger privacy protections would ensure that these companies are held accountable for their actions and that users have more control over their data.

On the other hand, some argue that individuals should be responsible for managing their own privacy on social media. After all, these platforms are voluntary, and users are not forced to share personal information. If someone is concerned about their privacy, they can simply choose not to use social media at all or limit the amount of information they share. Additionally, social media companies argue that they need access to user data to provide a better user experience and that stronger privacy protections could stifle innovation.

In conclusion, while there are certainly arguments on both sides of this issue, I believe that stronger privacy protections are needed on social media. The potential consequences of oversharing personal information are simply too great to ignore, and social media companies have not shown that they can be trusted to protect their users' data. By implementing stronger privacy protections, we can ensure that individuals are able to use social media safely and without fear of negative consequences.""",1,0.99368215,1,True

First of all, let's define what first impressions are. They're like, the initial feelings or judgments we make about someone or something based on our first encounter with them. Like, if you meet someone new and they're super friendly and outgoing, you're probably gonna have a positive first impression of them. But, can those impressions really be changed? That's what I'm here to find out.

I think first impressions can be pretty hard to change because they're often based on things that are really important to us, like how someone looks or acts. For example, if someone is really good-looking, it's gonna be hard for them to change that first impression, even if they're actually a really nice person. Or, if someone is really shy and reserved, it's gonna be hard for them to change that first impression, even if they're actually super outgoing once you get to know them.

But, on the other hand, I think it's possible for first impressions to change if you give someone a chance. Like, if you get to know someone better, you might find out that they're actually really interesting and funny, even if they didn't seem that way at first. Or, if someone is really mean or rude to you at first, it might be hard to change that impression, but if they apologize or show that they're willing to change, it could be possible.

Another thing that makes me think first impressions are hard to change is that people tend to judge others based on superficial things, like how they look or what they're wearing. Like, if someone is wearing a really nice outfit, it might make a good first impression, but if they're not actually nice or interesting, it's not gonna matter. And, if someone is wearing something that's not really stylish or popular, it might make a bad first impression, even if they're actually really cool.

First, increased school hours would wear out students, leading to a decrease in overall student engagement during class. Many students already feel overwhelmed managing multiple classes and activities, and the strain of adding additional hours of class and homework would be too great. 

Second, increased school hours could cause students to skip out on extracurriculars, which provide valuable skills for future success. As students already struggle to find the balance between their school work and extracurriculars, additional hours would only add to the stress and could result in students forgoing many activities outside of class, thus limiting their opportunities for growth. 

Finally, an extended school day would lessen students' free time. This would especially affect those with commitments outside of school, such as jobs and family obligations, which are essential and enriching experiences for adolescents.

I am writing to you regarding the school's cell phone policy. I believe that Policy 1, which allows students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time, is the better policy.

Firstly, cell phones can be a useful tool for students during emergencies. If a student needs to contact their parents or guardians, they can do so easily with their phone. In addition, cell phones can be used for educational purposes, such as accessing online resources and taking notes.

Secondly, Policy 1 teaches students responsibility. By allowing them to bring their phones to school, we are giving them the opportunity to learn how to manage their time and prioritize their responsibilities. This will help them develop important life skills that they will need in the future.

Lastly, banning cell phones altogether may not be effective. Students may still bring their phones to school and use them secretly, which could lead to disciplinary issues. It is better to have a policy that allows students to use their phones in a responsible manner, rather than completely banning them.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that Policy 1 is the better choice for our school. It allows students to have access to their phones for emergencies and educational purposes, teaches them responsibility, and is more likely to be effective than a complete ban on cell phones.

B2055DB7B29E,"Self-esteem is an individual’s opinion of themselves and their worth. It can be influenced by many different sources such as past experiences, family and society. Achievement is also a source of self-esteem. That is, achieving something – whether it be a personal goal or a major victory – can lead to a higher level of self-confidence. 

For example, a student who works diligently for a school project and earns a perfect score can gain a boost in their self-esteem. That student may then set larger goals for themselves in the future and feel more capable of meeting challenges. Alternatively, a worker who receives a promotion can feel proud of their success. This positive recognition of their achievement can boost their level of self-worth and lead to higher credibility when trying to achieve future goals. 

The process of achieving something can also be a source of self-esteem. Setting goals and objectives and pushing one’s self to achieve them can be a very rewarding experience in terms of self-confidence and self-worth. Achieving something also can involve rewarding yourself for successes. This could be in the form of celebratory treats or taking time for yourself to relax and enjoy the fruits of your hard work. Equally important is being able to recognize your successes, both big and small.

In conclusion, achievement is a great source of self-esteem for many people. Not only does achieving something lead to a higher level of self-confidence and recognition, but the process of committing to and achieving a goal is also a self-esteem booster. Knowing how to reward yourself after achieving something and setting goals appropriately so that they are achievable are also important strategies.",1,0.9945268,1,True

My parents want me to get good grades, my friends want me to fit in with their crowd, and social media is just like, constantly telling me that I need to be more popular or pretty or whatever. It's like, can't I just be myself?!

Anyway, so, like, I think the theme of the essay could be something like ""The Importance of Being True to Yourself in a World That's Always Trying to Change You.""

This is because those with positive attitudes not only tend to recognize their own potential, but also are better at embracing and seeing opportunities to grow and better themselves. Moreover, personal experiences and life lessons can be a primary factor that can influence one's attitude towards life - enabling them to face challenges, stay positive even when faced with adversity, and constantly strive to be better. 

Positive attitudes can also be infectious, enabling those with an upbeat attitude to be role models for those in their community - encouraging positivity and providing the motivation necessary to help others overcome challenges and find success. The importance of acknowledging and encouraging people with positive attitudes is invaluable to any community, as it encourages an environment of growth and any form of adversity can be faced together. Ultimately, having a positive attitude can help individuals to unlock their full potential and have great success; it is no surprise that attitude plays an essential role in the various forms of personal success.",1,0.99485695,1,True

Title: The Benefits of Keeping Yourself Busy

Introduction:
Hey there, folks! Today, I'm gonna talk about something that I think is super important for all of us: keeping ourselves busy. Now, I know some people might think, ""Ugh, why do I gotta do so much stuff all the time? Can't I just chill and relax?"" But trust me, being busy is actually really good for you! (Note: I know I spelled ""busy"" wrong, but that's just how I would write it in real life 😅)

Body:
So, let's get into it! Here are three reasons why keeping yourself busy is beneficial:

Point 1: You get more things done! When you're busy, you're not just sitting around twiddling your thumbs. You're actively doing stuff, whether it's homework, chores, or extracurricular activities. And the more you do, the more you'll get done! Plus, you'll feel a sense of accomplishment when you cross things off your to-do list. (Note: I accidentally wrote ""twiddling your thumbs"" instead of ""wasting time"". Oops!)

Point 2: You're not considered lazy! Let's face it, when you're not doing anything, people might think you're lazy. But when you're busy, you're showing everyone that you're motivated and willing to put in the effort. And who wants to be called lazy? Not me! (Note: I accidentally wrote ""motivated"" instead of ""motivated and willing"". Oops again!)

Point 3: You learn new things! When you're busy, you're constantly trying new things and learning new skills. Whether it's playing a new sport, learning a new language, or volunteering in your community, you're broadening your horizons and expanding your knowledge. And who knows, you might even discover a new passion! (Note: I accidentally wrote ""passion"" instead of ""hobby"". Oops again!)

falcon_180b_v1_861,"I am completely against the idea of letting parents monitor their child's grades and attendance online. There are several reasons why I think this is a bad idea.

Firstly, it violates the privacy of the student. As a high school student, I believe that my grades and attendance records are private and should not be shared with anyone without my permission. If parents can access this information freely, it will only cause more problems for the student.

Secondly, it takes away the responsibility of the student to communicate with their parents. It is the student's job to inform their parents about their grades and attendance, not the school's job. By allowing parents to access this information online, the school is essentially doing the student's job.

Furthermore, it could create unnecessary tension between the student and their parents. If a student is struggling in a class and their parents are constantly monitoring their grades, it may cause the student to feel pressured and stressed out. This could lead to a negative relationship between the student and their parents.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that schools should not allow parents to monitor their child's grades and attendance online. It violates the student's privacy, takes away their responsibility, and could create unnecessary tension in the student-parent relationship.",1,0.9925585,1,True
D0211302AE30,"Over the past few decades, technology has had a major impact on people’s lives. One of the most significant changes brought about by technology is the ability to complete tasks without human contact. From online grocery shopping to hailing a taxi through an app, there are plenty of activities that can now be conducted without having to interact with human beings. 

Technology has not only improved convenience for many day-to-day tasks, but also enabled new pathways for learning and work. Books, both in physical and digital forms, can provide knowledge and entertainment without the need to speak with another person. Video games, used in the right way, offer education, information, and analytical thinking while providing an immersive experience. Furthermore, the internet and its many web-based resources have made it possible to learn and work from anywhere in the world. 

In conclusion, technology has allowed people to complete tasks without any human contact, while also offering various benefits to individuals’ learning and work. Whether it be books, games, or any digital resource, people are now able to explore knowledge and complete tasks in ways that would have been unimaginable only a few decades ago.",1,0.9935796,1,True
94EC7DF6EA74,"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that going outdoors has numerous benefits for both physical and mental health. In this essay, I will explore the benefits of spending time outdoors, activities that can be enjoyed outside, the various outdoor games that people can play, the effect of not going outdoors on one's health, why some people avoid going outside when they have free time, the ways in which listening to music outside can be beneficial, and the precautions and considerations that should be taken when going outdoors.

Firstly, going outside has numerous benefits for physical health. Spending time outdoors can help to reduce stress levels, lower blood pressure, and improve mood. Additionally, outdoor activities such as hiking, biking, and swimming can help to improve cardiovascular health and build strength and endurance.

Secondly, there are many activities that can be enjoyed outside. These include hiking, biking, swimming, playing sports, and simply relaxing in the fresh air. These activities can be enjoyed alone or with friends and family, and can be tailored to suit different interests and fitness levels.

Thirdly, there are many outdoor games that people can play. These include frisbee, soccer, basketball, and volleyball, to name just a few. These games can be enjoyed with friends, family, or even by yourself, and can be a great way to stay active and socialize at the same time.

Fourthly, not going outdoors can have a negative impact on one's health. Spending too much time indoors can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, which can increase the risk of obesity, heart disease, and other health problems. Additionally, indoor air pollution can have negative effects on respiratory health.

Fifthly, some people avoid going outside when they have free time due to a variety of reasons. These reasons can include fear of the outdoors, lack of interest in outdoor activities, or simply a preference for indoor activities. However, it is important to make an effort to spend time outdoors, as the benefits can have a positive impact on overall health and well-being.

Sixthly, listening to music outside can be beneficial in a number of ways. For example, listening to music can help to reduce stress and improve mood, and can also provide a sense of relaxation and calm.",1,0.9940842,1,True
llama_70b_v1805,"I think that schools should not allow parents to monitor their kids grades and attendance online. First of all, it's like, invasion of privacy. Like, why do parents need to know every single grade we get? It's not like they're gonna help us with our homework or anything. And if they see that we're missing a lot of school, they might get mad and be all like ""Why are you skipping school?!"" And that's just stressful, you know?

Plus, like, what if we're not doing well in a class? Do we really want our parents to see that? They might be all disappointed and stuff, and that's just not cool. Or what if we're absent a lot because we're sick or something? They might think we're just skipping school and not care about our education.

And also, like, it's not like parents are always right. Sometimes they don't understand what's going on in our lives, you know? They might see a bad grade and be all like ""What's wrong with you? Why are you not trying harder?"" But maybe we are trying our best and it's just not working out. Or maybe we're having some personal problems and can't focus on school right now.

We should have some space to mess up and learn from our mistakes without our parents always breathing down our necks.",1,0.99373746,1,True
llama_70b_v1948,"I think that students would definitely benefit from being able to attend classes from home through distance learning. There are many reasons why this is the case.

Firstly, distance learning provides students with the opportunity to learn at their own pace. Some students may need more time to understand certain concepts, while others may need less time. By being able to attend classes from home, students can learn at their own speed, pausing and rewinding lectures as needed, without feeling rushed or left behind.

Secondly, distance learning allows students to learn in a comfortable and familiar environment. Students can attend classes from the comfort of their own homes, without the need to travel to school. This can be especially beneficial for students who have anxiety or other mental health issues that make it difficult for them to attend school in person.

Thirdly, distance learning provides students with the opportunity to access classes that may not be available at their local school. For example, a student who lives in a rural area may not have access to a particular course or subject at their local school, but they can access it through distance learning.

Fourthly, distance learning can be more cost-effective than traditional in-person learning. Students can save money on transportation and food costs by attending classes from home. Additionally, schools can save money on infrastructure and facility costs by not having to maintain physical classrooms.

However, it is important to note that distance learning is not without its challenges. One of the main challenges is the potential for distractions at home, such as family members, pets, and other responsibilities. Additionally, students may struggle with motivation and engagement, as they may feel disconnected from their peers and teachers.

To overcome these challenges, it is important for schools to provide students with support and resources to help them succeed in a distance learning environment. This can include providing students with access to virtual learning environments, online resources, and virtual support groups. Teachers can also use various tools and strategies to engage students and promote motivation, such as gamification, interactive activities, and virtual field trips.

In conclusion, I believe that students would greatly benefit from being able to attend classes from home through distance learning. It provides students with flexibility, access to a wider range of courses, and cost-effectiveness. While there are challenges to overcome, with the right support and resources, distance learning can be a valuable tool for students to succeed in their education.",1,0.9939693,1,True
llama_70b_v1284,"Introduction:
Hey there! I've come across some pretty interesting information that I'd like to share with you regarding the Face on Mars. You know, that supposed alien structure that's been the talk of the town for ages? Well, let me tell you, it's not as extraterrestrial as you might think. In fact, the Face is actually a natural landform, and I'm here to convince you why.

Body:
First of all, let's talk about the location of the Face. The article mentions that it's situated in the Cydonia region of Mars, which is known for its unusual terrain. The area is filled with valleys, craters, and mesas, which are all natural formations that can be explained by geological processes. Now, if the Face was created by aliens, wouldn't they have chosen a more, I don't know, ""alien"" location? Somewhere that's not so... earth-like?

Furthermore, the article goes on to explain that the Face is actually a combination of two distinct features: a hill and a valley. The hill is about 1,000 feet tall and 1.5 miles wide, while the valley is about 200 feet deep and 1.5 miles long. Now, these dimensions are pretty massive, but they're not exactly out of this world (pun intended). In fact, similar formations can be found right here on Earth, like the Grand Canyon or Mount Everest.

But wait, there's more! The article also mentions that the Face is surrounded by a series of smaller mesas, which are essentially flat-topped hills. These mesas are formed by the erosion of soft rock, which is a common geological process on Mars. And get this - the mesas are actually aligned with the prevailing wind direction! That's right, folks, it's just good old-fashioned wind erosion at work.

Now, I know what you're thinking - what about the eerie resemblance to a human face? Well, let me tell you, that's just a coincidence. The article explains that the Face is actually a result of the combination of shadows and lighting conditions. When the sun is at a certain angle, the shadows create the illusion of eyes, a nose, and a mouth. But, if you look at the Face from a different angle, it doesn't look like a face at all! It's just a bunch of random hills and valleys.

Conclusion:
So there you have it, folks! The Face on Mars is not a creation of aliens, but a natural landform that can be explained by geological processes. Sure, it might look a little spooky, but that's just the way the wind blows (literally!). I hope I've convinced you that the Face is not as extraterrestrial as it seems. It's time to unmask the Face on Mars and see it for what it truly is - a beautiful, natural wonder of our solar system. Thanks for listening!",1,0.98863935,1,True
B7053BDF5BA0,"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grade student on the benefits of an older student-younger student mentoring program:

Mentoring programs have been around for a long time, but older student-younger student mentoring programs are becoming increasingly popular. These programs are when older students, usually high schoolers, are paired with younger students, usually in middle school, to help them with their academic and personal growth. I think these programs are really beneficial and I'm going to tell you why.

First of all, older students can help younger students with their schoolwork. If a younger student is struggling in a particular subject, their older mentor can help them understand the material better. This can be especially helpful for younger students who may not have access to extra help outside of school. Plus, older students can teach younger students new study habits and time management skills that can help them do better in school.

Another benefit of older student-younger student mentoring programs is that they can help build confidence and self-esteem in younger students. When a younger student has an older mentor who believes in them and supports them, it can make them feel more confident in their abilities. This can help them feel more comfortable in their own skin and more willing to take on new challenges.

Older students can also provide emotional support to younger students. Sometimes, younger students may be going through tough times at home or in their personal lives, and they may not have anyone to talk to about it. An older mentor can provide a safe and supportive space for them to talk about their feelings and work through their problems.

Finally, older student-younger student mentoring programs can help bridge the gap between different generations. Older students can learn from the perspectives and experiences of younger students, and vice versa. This can help create a more inclusive and understanding community where everyone feels valued and respected.

In conclusion, older student-younger student mentoring programs are really beneficial for both the older and younger students involved. They can help with schoolwork, build confidence and self-esteem, provide emotional support, and bridge the gap between different generations.

I am writing to you regarding the issue of community service for students. I understand that some of my friends believe community service is important, while others feel it takes too much time away from their personal needs and wants. As a student in grade 9, I have my own opinion on this matter.

In my opinion, students should be required to perform community service. Firstly, community service provides an opportunity for students to help others in need. For example, tutoring elementary school children is a great way for students to give back to the community, and it can make a huge difference in the lives of those they tutor. Secondly, community service can also help students develop important skills such as teamwork, leadership, and communication. These skills will not only benefit them in their academic and personal lives but also in their future careers.

I understand that some students may feel that community service takes away from their personal time, but I believe that the benefits of community service far outweigh the drawbacks. Students can choose to perform community service during their free time, such as on weekends or during breaks, so that it does not interfere with their schoolwork or other obligations.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that students should be required to perform community service. It not only benefits the community but also helps students develop important skills that will benefit them in the future. Thank you for your time and consideration.

llama_70b_v11024,"The legalization of marijuana has been a topic that has been argued about for a while now. Some people think it's a good idea, while others don't. In my opinion, I think it's a good idea to legalize marijuana.

First of all, marijuana is not a dangerous drug. It's not addictive like other drugs, and it doesn't cause any harm to the body. In fact, it has been proven that marijuana has a lot of medical benefits. It can help with pain, nausea, and even anxiety. It's also a natural plant, so it's not like we're putting something artificial into our bodies.

Another reason why marijuana should be legalized is that it can help with crime. A lot of people who are in jail for drug-related crimes are there because of marijuana. If it were legal, these people wouldn't be in jail, and we could use the money we spend on imprisoning them for other things. Plus, legalizing marijuana would take away a lot of the power from drug dealers and gangs.

Furthermore, legalizing marijuana would help with the economy. If it were legal, we could tax it and use that money for important things like schools and hospitals. It would also create jobs, like people who work at dispensaries and farms.

Of course, some people might argue that marijuana is a gateway drug, meaning that people who use it will eventually start using other drugs. But that's not true. There's no scientific evidence to support that claim.

In conclusion, I believe that marijuana should be legalized. It's not a dangerous drug, it has medical benefits, it can help with crime and the economy, and it's not a gateway drug. I think it's time for us to take a closer look at the laws surrounding marijuana and consider making it legal.",1,0.9895219,1,True
DD265EC28AEB,"As the world of technology advances, more and more schools are turning to cell phones for educational purposes. Integrating cell phones into schoolwork can be a great way to engage students and allow them to explore their learning in a more interactive way. 

However, the potential negative effects of using cell phones for educational purposes must also be considered. There have been reports of students relying too much on technology to complete academic tasks, as well as instances of students becoming easily distracted by their phones in the classroom. In addition, the effects of using cell phones for educational purposes have yet to be determined, and could have a lasting impact on the students' overall learning. 

There are ways to keep students focused while still encouraging cell phone use for learning. Educators can set guidelines about acceptable and inappropriate use of cell phones in the classroom, letting students know when phone use is and is not appropriate. Classroom discussions, activities, and group work can also help keep students on task. Additionally, setting expectations for when and how students can use their phones can help ensure phones are being used in a productive and educational manner.

Likewise, when a workplace problem arises, we may respond with a problem-solving attitude or remain stuck in the despair. Similarly, we can choose how we respond to a situation where someone loses control of their emotions; we can be understanding and patient, or react harshly. 

However, it can be exceptionally difficult to keep things from affect us when they are related to family and other matters that are deeply important to us.

Like, remember when we used to have to actually call people to talk to them? Or, like, send them a message on MSN Messenger? Now, it's all about the DMs and the likes and the comments.

506cc6e0,"Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my support for the retention of the Electoral College in the selection of the President of the United States. While it is understood that there are arguments in favor of switching to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College provides several important benefits that should be taken into consideration.

One of the primary advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome that it provides. As the system currently stands, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College almost always exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that the potential for disputed elections is significantly reduced. In contrast, a direct popular vote system would likely result in more disputes over the outcome, as any slight shift in the popular vote could have a significant impact. This stability and certainty are crucial in ensuring that our democratic process is respected and can move forward efficiently.

Furthermore, the Electoral College requires presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal. No single region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, meaning that candidates must appeal to a broader range of voters. This is important because it ensures that the president represents the entire nation, not just a specific region. It fosters national unity and prevents the marginalization of certain areas or interests. Under a popular vote system, candidates would have less incentive to campaign in regions that they know they cannot win, which could lead to a feeling of disenfranchisement among voters in those areas.

The Electoral College also encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states or toss-up states. These states are typically more representative of the entire nation and are likely to have a more thoughtful and engaged electorate. By prioritizing these states, candidates are forced to listen to and address the concerns of a wider range of voters. This ensures that the election is decided by the most informed and engaged citizens, leading to a more representative outcome.

Additionally, the Electoral College helps balance the political influence of large and small states. Large states have more electoral votes and therefore receive more attention from presidential candidates during campaigns. This is important in offsetting the disproportionate power held by small states due to the mal-apportionment of the Senate. By giving larger states more weight in the election process, the Electoral College ensures that their voices are heard and their interests are taken into account.

Finally, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections. In the event that no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, the Electoral College guarantees a clear winner. This avoids the complications and logistical challenges that come with run-off elections. It also prevents situations where a candidate with a small plurality of the popular vote could win the election, potentially undermining the legitimacy of the presidency.

While it is true that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in states where their preferred candidate has little chance of winning, it is important to remember that the majority of voters in presidential elections are motivated by the desire to express their political preferences. The impact of a single vote in a national election is limited, yet millions of Americans still cast their votes because they believe in the democratic process and want their voice to be heard.

In conclusion, the Electoral College provides stability, regional representation, thoughtful decision-making, balance between large and small states, and a clear winner. It may have its flaws, but it is a system that has proven effective in ensuring the fair and representative selection of the President. I urge you to consider these advantages and support the retention of the Electoral College.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

93385DED39E7,"Distance learning has become increasingly popular in recent years, with many students and educators turning to online classes as a way to learn and teach. While distance learning has its advantages, it also has its disadvantages. In this essay, I will explore the pros and cons of distance learning in the educational context and analyze how this method can be beneficial or detrimental to students in various situations.

One of the main advantages of distance learning is flexibility. Students can learn at their own pace, on their own schedule, and from anywhere with an internet connection. This can be particularly beneficial for students who have other commitments, such as jobs or family responsibilities, that make it difficult to attend traditional classes. Additionally, distance learning allows students to choose from a wider range of courses and programs, as they are not limited to those offered by their local school or university.

Another advantage of distance learning is that it can be more cost-effective than traditional classroom learning. Students do not have to pay for transportation, housing, or other expenses associated with attending classes on campus. Additionally, many online courses are offered for free or at a lower cost than traditional courses.

However, there are also some disadvantages to distance learning. One of the main disadvantages is that it can be isolating. Students may miss out on the social interaction and support that comes with attending classes on campus. This can be particularly difficult for students who are new to a school or program, as they may not have the same opportunities to make connections with their peers and professors.

Another disadvantage of distance learning is that it can be more challenging to stay motivated. Without the structure of a traditional classroom, students may struggle to keep up with their coursework and stay on track. Additionally, students may have difficulty staying organized and managing their time effectively, which can lead to poor academic performance.

In conclusion, distance learning has both advantages and disadvantages. While it offers flexibility and cost savings, it can also be isolating and challenging to stay motivated. Ultimately, the effectiveness of distance learning will depend on the individual student and their specific situation. For some students, the benefits of distance learning may outweigh the drawbacks, while for others, traditional classroom learning may be a better fit.",1,0.9927303,1,True
c1440923,"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. As seen in the passage set, various cities and communities have implemented measures to reduce car dependency, resulting in positive outcomes such as reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, and a shift towards more sustainable and efficient transportation options.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. As mentioned in the passage, passenger cars account for a substantial portion of these emissions, contributing to climate change and air pollution. By reducing the number of cars on the road, either through car-free zones or car-free days, emissions can be greatly decreased, leading to a cleaner and healthier environment. For example, the article about Paris banning driving due to smog highlights how implementing a partial driving ban resulted in a 60 percent decrease in congestion and improved air quality.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of alternative transportation methods, such as walking, biking, and public transit. By creating car-free zones or designing communities with accessibility to public transportation, individuals are encouraged to use these more sustainable options. This not only reduces traffic congestion but also provides health benefits, as active modes of transportation like walking and biking promote physical activity. In the article about the car-free day in Bogota, Colombia, it is mentioned how millions of Colombians hiked, biked, or took buses to work, leaving the streets free of traffic jams and promoting alternative transportation.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can contribute to the development of more compact and walkable communities. Instead of relying on vast amounts of land for parking spaces and sprawling suburbs, smart planning can create neighborhoods with amenities within walking distance. This approach, as demonstrated in the German suburb of Vauban, leads to a higher quality of life, reduced dependence on cars, and a stronger sense of community. The article describes how Vauban’s streets are completely car-free, with car ownership limited to a few designated parking areas. As a result, a significant percentage of residents do not own cars and have reported feeling happier and less stressed.

In addition to the environmental and social benefits, limiting car usage can also have economic advantages. The passage on the end of car culture highlights that recent studies suggest Americans are buying fewer cars and driving less. This shift in behavior can lead to lower carbon emissions and reduce the need for extensive highway infrastructure, saving costs in the long run. Moreover, it opens up opportunities for business innovation, such as car-sharing programs and alternative modes of transportation like bike-sharing. These new business models can create jobs and drive economic growth while providing people with affordable and convenient transportation options.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers numerous advantages for individuals, society, and the environment. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting alternative transportation methods, creating walkable communities, and stimulating economic growth, the limitations on car usage can lead to a healthier, more sustainable, and more enjoyable way of life. As demonstrated in the passage set, various cities and communities around the world are already implementing these measures and experiencing the benefits firsthand. It is crucial for fellow citizens to recognize these advantages and support initiatives that encourage the reduction of car dependency for the betterment of our future.",1,0.9927008,1,True

In his famous letter to John Adams, he wrote, ""I am convinced that there is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good humor."" Jefferson believed that laughter and good humor were essential to the progress of society, and that they could only be achieved through constant work and motion.

Jefferson's perspective on the importance of constant work and motion can be seen in his own life. He was a prolific writer, inventor, and architect, and he was constantly working on new projects and ideas. He believed that the only way to achieve success and progress was through constant work and motion, and he set an example for others to follow.

In today's world, Jefferson's perspective on the importance of constant work and motion is still relevant. Many people believe that success and progress can only be achieved through hard work and dedication. For example, many successful entrepreneurs and business leaders have worked tirelessly to achieve their goals, and they have credited their success to their constant work and motion.

However, Jefferson's perspective on the importance of constant work and motion is not without its critics. Some people argue that it can lead to burnout and exhaustion, and that it is not always necessary for progress. For example, some artists and creatives have achieved great success by taking breaks and allowing themselves time to rest and recharge.

92D03AB56C53,"Title: The Importance of Failure in the Pursuit of Success

Introduction:

Winston Churchill once said, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts."" This famous phrase highlights the significance of failure in the journey towards success. As an 8th grader, I believe that failure is an essential element to consider in the pursuit of success. In this essay, I will explain why failure is important, provide examples of how it can lead to success or create problems, outline the steps to take when facing failure, and summarize why failure is an integral part of the success process.

Why Failure is Important:

Failure is often seen as a negative experience that hinders progress and achievement. However, I believe that failure is a crucial stepping stone towards success. When we fail, we learn valuable lessons that help us improve and grow. For instance, if we fail a test, we can review the material and study harder for the next test, leading to better results. Similarly, if we start a business and it fails, we can use that experience to create a better business idea. Failure teaches us to be resilient, adaptable, and persistent, which are essential qualities for success.

Examples of How Failure Can Lead to Success:

1. Thomas Edison failed over 1,000 times before inventing the light bulb. His persistence and determination led to a groundbreaking invention.
2. J.K. Rowling was rejected by 12 publishers before one finally agreed to publish the Harry Potter series. Her determination and failure led to a global phenomenon.
3. Michael Jordan was cut from his high school basketball team. He used this failure as motivation to improve his skills and became one of the greatest basketball players of all time.

Steps to Take When Facing Failure:

1. Don't give up: The first step to overcoming failure is to not give up. Keep pushing forward and trying new things.
2. Learn from your mistakes: Analyze what went wrong and learn from your mistakes. Use this knowledge to improve and grow.
3. Seek help: Don't be afraid to ask for help from friends, family, or ment",1,0.99417156,1,True
CD9FDD5F9F9E,"Failure is a common experience for many people, but it can be a stepping stone to success if individuals use enthusiasm to learn from their mistakes. Inventions, medicines, and school experiences are just a few examples of how failures can lead to success with enthusiasm.

One example of how failure can lead to success is the story of Thomas Edison. Edison is known for inventing many devices, including the phonograph and the electric light bulb. However, it is also known that Edison failed many times before achieving success. For example, he failed over 1,000 times before he was able to create a successful light bulb. Edison's enthusiasm for invention and his determination to succeed ultimately led him to make many important discoveries and inventions that have had a significant impact on the world.

Another example of how failure can lead to success is in the field of medicine. Many drugs and treatments have been developed through trial and error, with many initial failures leading to eventual success. For example, penicillin was discovered by Alexander Fleming, but it took many years of research and development before it became a widely used antibiotic. The enthusiasm of scientists and researchers to find new treatments and cures for diseases has led to many important discoveries that have saved countless lives.

In the realm of education, failure can also be a stepping stone to success. Students often face challenges and setbacks in their academic journey, but with enthusiasm and a willingness to learn, they can overcome these obstacles and achieve their goals. For example, many successful people have struggled in school at some point in their lives, but they were able to use this experience as motivation to work harder and achieve more.

In conclusion, failures can be a valuable learning experience if individuals use enthusiasm to learn from their mistakes. Inventions, medicines, and school experiences are just a few examples of how failures can lead to success. By staying determined and enthusiastic, individuals can overcome obstacles and achieve their goals, ultimately leading to success.",1,0.9936786,1,True

First of all, it would be a huge help for college preparation. I mean, who doesn't want to get a head start on college? It would give us more time to study for tests, finish assignments, and work on projects. And let's be real, college is like, super important for our future.

6CDE42A3FA9F,"Albert Schweitzer was a prominent figure in the medical and humanitarian fields, known for his dedication to improving the lives of others. One of his famous quotes was ""Example is the only thing in influencing others,"" which suggests that the best way to influence others is through direct action and setting a positive example. However, I disagree with this statement and believe that influencing someone does not necessarily require being a direct example for them.

While it is true that people are often influenced by the actions and behaviors of those around them, it is not always the case that they must directly observe and emulate those examples. For instance, people can be influenced by the actions and behaviors of others even if they are not physically present or directly observing them. This can happen through media, such as television and the internet, which allow people to learn about and be inspired by the actions and behaviors of others.

Furthermore, even when people are directly observing a positive example, it is not always the case that they will be influenced by it. People have their own unique experiences and perspectives, and they may not always be able to relate to or understand the experiences of others. Additionally, people may be influenced by negative examples or by the absence of positive examples, which can be just as powerful in shaping their behavior and attitudes.

In conclusion, while it is true that people are often influenced by the actions and behaviors of those around them, it is not always the case that they must directly observe and emulate those examples. People can be influenced by the actions and behaviors of others through media, and even by negative examples or the absence of positive examples.

8EEEF415AA1E,"Hey, Mrs. Johnson! Here's my essay on the impact of family and society on an individual's ability to make their own life decisions.

So, like, families and societies totally influence the way we think and make decisions. They can shape our beliefs, values, and goals, and sometimes it feels like we can't make any choices without them. For example, if our parents are super religious, they might want us to go to a certain college or pursue a certain career. And if our friends all want to do something, it can be hard to say no. It's like, they're trying to help us, but sometimes it feels like they're holding us back.

But, on the other hand, families and societies can also provide support and guidance. They can teach us important life skills and give us a sense of belonging. Like, my family always tells me to be true to myself and follow my dreams, but they also help me with my homework and stuff. And my friends, they're always there to listen and give me advice. It's like, they're helping me make decisions, but they're not forcing me to do anything I don't want to do.

So, I think it's important to find a balance between family and society's influence and our own personal choices. Like, we should listen to their advice and learn from their experiences, but we should also be able to make our own decisions and be independent. It's hard, but it's important to find that balance.

In conclusion, families and societies have a big impact on our ability to make our own life decisions, but we should try to find a balance between their influence and our own personal choices. Thanks for reading, Mrs. Johnson!

Part 1:
I want to go to college because I want to achieve my future aspirations. I want to be a veterinarian when I grow up, and going to college is the best way to make that happen. I've always loved animals, and I want to help them feel better when they're sick or hurt. I know that going to college will give me the knowledge and skills I need to do that. Plus, my parents are always telling me how important it is to get a good education, so I don't want to disappoint them.

Part 2:
Going to college allows me to achieve different types of opportunities. For example, if I want to be a famous chef, I can take cooking classes and learn how to make all kinds of delicious foods. Or, if I want to get a job, I can take business classes and learn how to run a successful company. And if I want to be a professional sports player, I can take physical education classes and learn how to be the best athlete I can be. Going to college gives me the chance to try out all these different things and see what I'm really good at.

Part 3:

EEB4D170D513,"Chris Gardner is an inspiring individual who has achieved success through hard work, dedication, and perseverance. His journey of staying on top of his studies and overcoming obstacles in his life has enabled him to make a significant impact on society.

Gardner's story began in 1961 when he was born into poverty in Philadelphia. He struggled to make ends meet, and his family often had to rely on government assistance. Despite these challenges, Gardner was determined to succeed in school and pursue his dream of becoming a stockbroker.

Gardner's hard work paid off when he was accepted into the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business. However, he soon faced another obstacle when he was unable to afford the cost of tuition. To make ends meet, Gardner took on multiple jobs, including working as a security guard and a janitor.

Despite these challenges, Gardner remained committed to his studies and spent every spare moment he had studying for his exams. He also sought out mentorship from successful business leaders, who offered him guidance and advice.

Gardner's hard work and dedication paid off when he landed an internship at a prestigious brokerage firm. During his internship, Gardner demonstrated his knowledge and skills, and was eventually offered a full-time job.

However, Gardner's success was not without its challenges. In 1987, he was wrongfully accused of insider trading and was forced to leave his job and his apartment. Gardner was forced to live in homeless shelters and public transit stations, but he refused to give up.

Instead, Gardner used this time to reflect on his life and his goals. He realized that he had been taking his success for granted and that he needed to focus on the things that truly mattered. Gardner began to read books, take classes, and practice meditation, all of which helped him to stay focused and motivated.

Gardner's perseverance paid off when he was eventually cleared of the charges and was able to return to his job as a stockbroker. He continued to work hard and eventually became a successful businessman in his own right.

Jarvis, ""Determine never to be idle…It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" Jefferson recognized the potential power of consistent effort and encouraged others to stay busy in order to achieve worthwhile goals. 

At the same time, Jefferson believed that inactivity could have an important role to play in how we use our time. In his view, moments of pause could lead to reflection, contemplation, and self-examination–all of which are critical mental exercises that can lead to increased productivity, once motivation has been restored. 

When seeking to maximize our productivity, it is important to differentiate between Idle activities and productive activities. Idle activities, such as watching TV, scrolling through social media, or playing video games, can​ be enjoyable, but can also reduce our motivation and prevent us from reaching our goals. Productive activities, such as research, problem-solving, reading, and project-building, can help us to pursue our ambitions and are important for personal growth. 

To accomplish more, we must set achievable goals and use our time wisely.

schools have been adopting online policies to allow parents to monitor their children's grades and attendance. there are several arguments that support this practice, including parental involvement and accountability. however, there are also valid arguments against it. in this essay, i will argue against the practice of allowing parents to monitor their children's grades and attendance online.

one of the reasons i oppose this practice is that it can lead to unnecessary stress and pressure for students. knowing that their parents are constantly keeping an eye on their academic performance can cause students to feel anxious and overwhelmed. this can have adverse effects on their mental health and may even lead to depression.

furthermore, students should be held responsible for their own academic performance, rather than relying on their parents to keep tabs on their grades and attendance. it is important for students to learn how to be independent and take ownership of their own education. by allowing parents to monitor their grades and attendance, teachers and administrators are undermining this essential life skill.

lastly, this practice can also perpetuate helicopter parenting. helicopter parenting is when parents overly control their children's lives, including their education. by enabling them to constantly check on their child's grades and attendance, schools are feeding into this behavior. this is harmful for the child's development, as helicopter parenting has been linked to negative outcomes such as anxiety and lower self-esteem in children.

in conclusion, while there are some benefits to the practice of allowing parents to monitor their children's grades and attendance online, the drawbacks outweigh the advantages. it can lead to unnecessary stress, undermine student's independence, and encourage helicopter parenting. teachers and administrators should focus on empowering students to take control of their own education, rather than facilitating parental overreach.

Parents play a significant role in shaping the character traits of their children. They are the first role models that children encounter, and their behavior and actions have a significant impact on the development of their children's character. Parents who exhibit positive traits such as kindness, honesty, and responsibility are more likely to raise children with these traits. On the other hand, parents who exhibit negative traits such as selfishness, dishonesty, and irresponsibility are more likely to raise children with these traits.

Friends also play a crucial role in shaping the character traits of individuals. Friends are a significant source of socialization and influence, and their behavior and actions can have a significant impact on the development of an individual's character. Friends who exhibit positive traits such as loyalty, empathy, and respect are more likely to influence individuals to develop these traits. On the other hand, friends who exhibit negative traits such as bullying, dishonesty, and selfishness are more likely to influence individuals to develop these traits.

Firstly, having two additional hours of school per day would mean that students would have to wake up earlier and go to bed later. This could have a negative impact on their sleep patterns and overall health. Studies have shown that getting enough sleep is crucial for a student's academic performance and overall well-being. If students are not getting enough sleep, they may struggle to focus and learn effectively in the classroom.

Secondly, having a four-day school week would mean that students would have less time to participate in extracurricular activities.

falcon_180b_v1_579,"""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" is an interesting article that talks about how the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) enables computers to identify human emotions. This technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with machines and could even be used in classrooms to read the emotional expressions of students. However, the question is whether or not using this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable.

On one hand, using FACS in classrooms could be extremely beneficial. It could help teachers understand how their students are feeling and respond appropriately. For example, if a student is feeling frustrated or confused, the teacher can offer additional support or clarify the material. This personalized approach could lead to better learning outcomes for students and a more positive classroom environment.

Moreover, FACS could be used to identify students who may be struggling with mental health issues. Early intervention can be crucial in preventing more serious problems down the line. If a student is consistently displaying negative emotions, the teacher can notify the appropriate authorities and the student can receive the help they need.

However, there are also some potential drawbacks to using FACS in classrooms. For example, students may feel uncomfortable knowing that their emotions are being monitored by a computer. This could lead to a lack of trust between the teacher and the student and could even cause students to withdraw or become more introverted.

Additionally, FACS is not a perfect technology. It may not accurately identify all emotions, and it could even misinterpret some expressions. This could lead to false assumptions about how a student is feeling and could cause more harm than good.

In conclusion, while the use of FACS in classrooms may have some benefits, it is not without its potential drawbacks. It is important for educators to carefully consider the implications of using this technology and to prioritize the privacy and emotional well-being of their students. Only then can we determine whether or not FACS is truly valuable in the classroom.",1,0.9941982,1,True
CA966FF7F1E6,"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that talking to more than one person to seek multiple opinions and make better choices is an important skill that can benefit people in many ways. In today's fast-paced world, it's easy to rely on our own opinions and ideas without considering the perspectives of others. However, by seeking out the opinions of others, we can learn new things, make better decisions, and get help when needed.

One of the main benefits of talking to more than one person is that it allows us to learn new things. When we seek out the opinions of others, we are exposed to different perspectives and ideas that we may not have considered before. This can help us broaden our knowledge and understanding of a particular topic or issue. For example, if we are trying to decide on a college major, talking to people who have already chosen a major can help us learn about the different fields of study and the skills and knowledge required for each.

In addition to learning new things, talking to more than one person can also help us make better decisions. When we seek out the opinions of others, we are able to consider a wider range of factors and perspectives that can help us make more informed decisions. For example, if we are trying to decide on a new hobby, talking to friends who have tried different hobbies can help us determine which one would be the best fit for us based on our interests and skills.

Finally, talking to more than one person can also help us get help when needed. When we seek out the opinions of others, we are able to tap into their expertise and knowledge, which can be invaluable when we need help with a particular problem or issue. For example, if we are struggling with a math problem, talking to a teacher or tutor can help us better understand the concept and develop a solution.

In conclusion, talking to more than one person to seek multiple opinions and make better choices is an important skill that can benefit people in many ways. By seeking out the opinions of others, we can learn new things, make better decisions, and get help when needed. As an eighth-grade student, I encourage my peers to practice this skill and seek out the perspectives of others in order to make more informed decisions and improve their lives.",1,0.9947838,1,True
BBB9D66F934C,"Generic_School is currently considering the implementation of a four day school week, reducing the school's standard five day week to four days. While this would clearly cut down on operational costs, there are also many potential drawbacks to consider.

On the positive side, the four day school week would allow school administrators the flexibility to cut costs in various ways, such as reducing the number of teachers needed and increasing teacher salaries. It would also give students more time to pursue extracurricular activities that support academic and social development.

However, there are some potential negative consequences to a four day school week. With fewer days for class lectures and instruction, students may have less of an opportunity for direct contact with their teachers and for subject-specific tutoring. Additionally, shorter days can lead to more disruptions, which can hinder overall academic performance.

7EB7BB90A2F0,"Technology has had a significant impact on individuals and society as a whole. While it has brought many benefits, it has also had its drawbacks. In this essay, I will explore both the good and bad effects of technology on individuals and society.

On the positive side, technology has revolutionized the way we communicate, work, and learn. With the advent of smartphones, social media, and other communication technologies, people can now connect with each other instantly, regardless of their location. This has made it easier for people to maintain relationships with friends and family members who live far away. Additionally, technology has made it possible for people to work and learn from anywhere, making it easier for people to pursue their careers and education.

However, technology has also had its negative effects on individuals and society. One of the biggest concerns is the impact of technology on mental health. Studies have shown that excessive use of technology, particularly social media, can lead to feelings of anxiety, depression, and loneliness. Additionally, technology has led to a decline in face-to-face communication, which can lead to social isolation and a lack of empathy.

Another negative effect of technology is its impact on the environment. The production and disposal of electronic devices can have a significant impact on the environment, including the release of harmful chemicals and the depletion of natural resources. Additionally, the use of technology has led to an increase in energy consumption, which can contribute to climate change.

In conclusion, technology has had both good and bad effects on individuals and society. While it has brought many benefits, it has also had its drawbacks. It is important for individuals to be aware of both the positive and negative effects of technology and to use it in a responsible and sustainable way.

Like, if I want to get good at playing the guitar, I gotta practice every day. If I don't, I'll never get better.  It's just how it is.

And confidence is also a big deal. When we believe in ourselves and our abilities, we're more likely to take risks and try new things. Like, if I don't think I can do something, I'm not gonna even try. But if I have confidence in myself, I might take the leap and give it a shot. And usually, I'll be surprised at how well I can do it! 

But here's the thing: doing nothing and expecting results is not gonna cut it.  Like, if I just sit around and do nothing, I'm not gonna get anywhere. I gotta be willing to put in the effort and take risks if I want to grow. It's like, if I want to run a marathon, I gotta train for it.

Studying Venus is a challenging task due to its extreme environment, but is it worth the risk? In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author argues that it is, despite the dangers. In this essay, I will evaluate how well the author supports this idea using evidence from the article.

Body:

The author provides several reasons why studying Venus is a worthy pursuit. Firstly, Venus is Earth's closest planetary neighbor, and understanding its atmosphere and climate can provide valuable insights into Earth's own climate change. The author notes that Venus's atmosphere is composed mostly of carbon dioxide, which has led to a runaway greenhouse effect, making the planet's surface temperature hot enough to melt lead. Studying this phenomenon can help us better understand the impact of human activities on Earth's climate and how to mitigate its effects.

Secondly, the author highlights the potential for Venus to have once had liquid water on its surface, which raises the possibility of life existing there. The author cites the presence of minerals such as gypsum and halite, which are formed in the presence of water, as evidence of Venus's watery past. This suggests that Venus may have had a more hospitable environment in the past, making it an intriguing target for astrobiology research.

Thirdly, the author emphasizes the technological advancements that have made it possible to study Venus in greater detail. For instance, NASA's Magellan spacecraft was able to map Venus's surface in the early 1990s, revealing unique features such as volcanoes and impact craters. More recently, the European Space Agency's Venus Express orbiter discovered hydrochloric acid in Venus's atmosphere, which was a surprise to scientists. These discoveries demonstrate the potential for studying Venus to yield new and exciting scientific breakthroughs.

However, the author also acknowledges the challenges of exploring Venus. The planet's extreme heat and pressure make it difficult to design spacecraft that can survive for extended periods. Additionally, the thick atmosphere makes it difficult to obtain clear images of the surface. Nevertheless, the author argues that these challenges are not insurmountable and that the benefits of studying Venus outweigh the risks.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, the author provides strong evidence to support the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. By highlighting the potential for scientific breakthroughs, the possibility of life existing on Venus, and the technological advancements that have made it possible to study the planet in greater detail, the author makes a compelling case for continued exploration of Venus. While the challenges of exploring Venus are significant, the potential rewards are well worth the risk. Therefore, I agree with the author that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit and recommend continued investment in this area of research.",1,0.98665917,1,True

When individuals set and achieve their goals, it has a significant impact on their self-esteem. In this essay, we will analyze how the accomplishment of a goal pushes an individual to try harder, how it helps them to praise themselves, and how it provides them with a long-lasting satisfaction.

Firstly, achieving a goal pushes an individual to try harder. When individuals set a goal, they create a sense of purpose and direction in their lives. This purpose motivates them to work harder and strive for success. For example, if an individual sets a goal to improve their grades, they will work harder to study and complete their assignments. As they achieve each goal, they will feel a sense of accomplishment, which will motivate them to continue working towards their ultimate goal. This cycle of effort and reward creates a positive feedback loop that drives individuals to push themselves harder and achieve more.

Secondly, achieving a goal helps individuals to praise themselves. When individuals set a goal and achieve it, they feel a sense of pride and accomplishment. They can look back on their journey and see how far they have come. This self-reflection can help individuals to praise themselves for their hard work and dedication. For example, if an individual sets a goal to run a marathon and achieves it, they can look back on their training and see how far they have come. This sense of accomplishment can help to boost their self-esteem and give them a sense of confidence in their abilities.

Finally, achieving a goal provides individuals with a long-lasting satisfaction. When individuals set a goal and achieve it, they feel a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction.

Whether it's getting a bad grade on a test or quiz or facing a challenging situation, having a positive mindset can make all the difference in how we cope with potential failures. In this essay, I will analyze the effects of having a positive mindset and develop strategies on how to cope with potential failures.

Firstly, having a positive mindset can have a significant impact on our mental and emotional well-being. Research has shown that people who have a positive mindset tend to have better overall health, lower levels of stress, and higher levels of happiness. This is because a positive mindset allows us to focus on the good things in life and to see challenges as opportunities for growth rather than setbacks.

One way to maintain a positive attitude during difficult times is to practice positive self-talk. Positive self-talk involves replacing negative thoughts with positive ones. For example, instead of saying ""I'm terrible at math,"" we can say ""I'm getting better at math with practice."" This can help to shift our focus away from our failures and towards our progress.

Another strategy for maintaining a positive attitude during difficult times is to seek out support from others. Talking to friends, family, or a counselor can help us to put things into perspective and to feel less alone in our struggles. Additionally, seeking out support can help us to develop new strategies for coping with challenges.

Finally, it's important to remember that failures are a natural part of life. While getting a bad grade on a test or quiz can be disappointing, it doesn't define us. Instead of dwelling on our failures, we should use them as opportunities for growth and learning. By focusing on what we can learn from our failures, we can develop new skills and strategies that will help us to succeed in the future.

However, these initial impressions can change over time as we get to know someone better. This essay will explore the idea that first impressions can change after getting to know someone and provide personal experiences and factual evidence to support this opinion.

Personally, I have experienced this phenomenon multiple times. For example, when I first met my best friend, I thought she was quiet and reserved. However, as we spent more time together, I realized that she was actually very outgoing and had a great sense of humor. Similarly, when I first started working at my current job, I assumed that my boss was strict and unapproachable. However, over time, I got to know him better and realized that he was actually very friendly and approachable.

Research also supports the idea that first impressions can change after getting to know someone. A study conducted by the University of California, Berkeley found that people tend to overestimate the differences between themselves and others based on first impressions. This means that our initial judgments about someone can be influenced by factors such as appearance, body language, and initial interactions, leading us to make incorrect assumptions about their personality and behavior.

Another study conducted by the University of Chicago found that people's first impressions of others can be influenced by their own biases and assumptions. For example, if someone has a strong bias against people from a certain ethnic group, they may make negative first impressions of someone from that group based on their appearance or other superficial factors, even if they don't actually know the person.

In conclusion, first impressions can change after getting to know someone. Personal experiences and factual evidence both support this idea. It is important to remember that our initial judgments about someone can be influenced by factors such as appearance, body language, and initial interactions, leading us to make incorrect assumptions about their personality and behavior.

Firstly, using a cell phone while driving is a major distraction. When drivers are texting, talking, or browsing on their phones, they are not paying attention to the road and the other cars around them. This can lead to accidents, which can cause injuries or even death. In fact, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, distracted driving was responsible for 3,166 deaths in the United States in 2017.

Secondly, using a cell phone while driving is a dangerous habit that can lead to addiction. Many people feel the need to constantly check their phones for messages, notifications, or social media updates. This can be tempting for drivers, especially during long road trips or in heavy traffic. However, this habit can be deadly, as it takes the driver's focus away from the road and their surroundings.

Furthermore, using a cell phone while driving is illegal in many places. In some states, it is against the law to text and drive, while in others, it is illegal to use a hand-held electronic device while driving. These laws are in place because lawmakers recognize the dangers of distracted driving and want to protect the public from its risks.

Finally, there are alternatives to using a cell phone while driving. For example, drivers can use hands-free devices, such as Bluetooth headsets or car speakers, to make and receive calls. They can also use voice-to-text technology to send messages or make calls without having to physically handle their phones. Additionally, many cars now come equipped with built-in infotainment systems that allow drivers to access their phones' features without having to physically handle their devices.

In conclusion, using a cell phone while driving is a dangerous and distracting habit that can lead to accidents and fatalities.

While it is important for students to have opportunities to engage in activities outside of the classroom, there are also concerns about the impact of these activities on academic performance and overall well-being.

On the one hand, extracurricular activities can provide students with valuable experiences and skills that cannot be acquired in the classroom. For example, participating in sports or clubs can help students develop teamwork, leadership, and communication skills. Additionally, extracurricular activities can provide a sense of community and belonging, which can be especially important for students who may struggle with social issues in the classroom.

However, there are also concerns about the impact of extracurricular activities on academic performance. Many students may struggle to balance their academic responsibilities with their extracurricular commitments, leading to decreased grades and reduced study time. Additionally, some extracurricular activities may require a significant time commitment, which could interfere with other important activities such as family time or self-care.

In my opinion, schools should take a balanced approach to controlling students' involvement in extracurricular activities. While it is important for students to have opportunities to engage in activities outside of the classroom, schools should also ensure that students are not overloaded with extracurricular commitments that may negatively impact their academic performance or overall well-being.

One way that schools could control students' involvement in extracurricular activities is by setting limits on the number of activities that students are allowed to participate in. For example, schools could require students to choose one or two extracurricular activities, and limit the number of hours that they are allowed to spend on these activities each week.

Another way that schools could control students' involvement in extracurricular activities is by providing resources and support to help students balance their academic and extracurricular responsibilities. For example, schools could offer study groups or tutoring services to help students stay on top of their coursework, or provide mentorship and guidance to help students navigate the challenges of balancing their extracurricular commitments with their academic and personal responsibilities.

llama_70b_v1329,"Gun control is a very sensitive topic in many countries, and it's understandable that people have different opinions on it. In my opinion, stricter gun control laws are necessary to ensure the safety of citizens.

Firstly, the availability of guns leads to an increase in gun violence. According to statistics, countries with stricter gun control laws have lower rates of gun violence. For example, in the United States, states with stricter gun control laws have lower rates of gun violence compared to states with more lenient gun laws. This shows that limiting the availability of guns can lead to a reduction in gun violence.

Secondly, stricter gun control laws can help prevent mass shootings. Mass shootings have become a common occurrence in many countries, and they are often carried out using assault rifles that are easily accessible to the public. If stricter gun control laws were in place, it would be more difficult for individuals who intend to commit mass shootings to obtain these weapons. For instance, in Australia, after a mass shooting in 1996, the government implemented stricter gun control laws, and there has not been a single mass shooting since then.

Thirdly, stricter gun control laws can help reduce suicide rates. Studies have shown that states with stricter gun control laws have lower suicide rates. This is because individuals who are struggling with mental health issues are less likely to have access to guns, which can be used to impulsively end their lives.

Finally, stricter gun control laws can help reduce gun trafficking. Gun trafficking is a major issue in many countries, and it often involves the illegal sale of guns to individuals who are not legally allowed to own them. Stricter gun control laws can help prevent this by making it more difficult for individuals to obtain guns illegally.

In conclusion, stricter gun control laws are necessary to ensure the safety of citizens. They can help reduce gun violence, prevent mass shootings, reduce suicide rates, and prevent gun trafficking. While some argue that gun control laws infringe upon their right to bear arms, I believe that the safety of citizens should be of utmost importance.

According to the National Center for Education Statistics, the average school day in the United States is around 6-7 hours long, with some schools offering longer hours for certain subjects or extracurricular activities. In comparison, schools in other countries vary widely in their hours of operation. For example, in Japan, students attend school from 8:00 am to 3:30 pm, with some schools offering after-school programs until 5:00 pm. In contrast, in many European countries, students attend school from 8:00 am to 3:00 pm, with some schools offering after-school programs until 4:00 pm.

While the length of the school day can vary greatly from country to country, it's important to consider the activities that students typically participate in after school. Many students engage in a variety of extracurricular activities, such as sports, music, and clubs, which can help them develop important skills and interests outside of the classroom. However, if schools were to extend their hours of operation, it could impact these after-school activities. For example, some students may not have the time or energy to participate in extracurricular activities if they are attending school for longer hours.

In addition to after-school activities, extended school hours can also impact student physical and emotional health. Research has shown that students who attend school for longer hours are more likely to experience stress, fatigue, and other negative health effects. This can be especially true for students who are already struggling with mental health issues, such as anxiety or depression. Furthermore, if students are attending school for longer hours, it can also impact their family life, as their parents may have to adjust their work schedules or make other arrangements to accommodate their",1,0.9922117,1,True
6CD851AF4D16,"Staying Busy: A Pathway to Personal Success

Staying busy is a crucial aspect of achieving personal success. It involves actively pursuing goals and utilizing one's time and resources effectively. In this essay, we will explore the advantages of staying busy and the dangers of being idle.

One of the primary advantages of staying busy is that it helps individuals stay focused and motivated. When we have a clear goal in mind, we are more likely to stay on track and work towards achieving it. For example, a student who is actively studying for an exam will likely perform better than one who is not. This is because the student is using their time and resources effectively, and they are more likely to retain the information they need to succeed.

Another advantage of staying busy is that it can lead to positive results. By actively pursuing goals, individuals are more likely to achieve them. For instance, an athlete who practices regularly is more likely to improve their skills and perform better in competitions. This is because they are putting in the time and effort to hone their abilities.

However, there are also dangers to being idle. When we are not actively pursuing goals, we are more likely to waste our time and resources. For example, spending too much time on social media can lead to a lack of productivity and can negatively impact our mental health. Additionally, being idle can lead to a lack of motivation and focus, which can hinder our ability to achieve our goals.

In conclusion, staying busy is a crucial aspect of achieving personal success. By actively pursuing goals and utilizing our time and resources effectively, we can stay focused and motivated, leading to positive results. However, being idle can lead to a lack of productivity, motivation, and focus, which can hinder our ability to achieve our goals. It is important to find a balance between staying busy and taking breaks to rest and recharge.",1,0.9949057,1,True
71129FE0D18F,"Graduating from high school in three years has both benefits and drawbacks. While it may seem like a great opportunity to get ahead, there are legal statuses, financial concerns, and pre-credit courses that must be considered.

One of the biggest benefits of graduating from high school in three years is the ability to enter the workforce sooner. This can be especially beneficial for those who are ready to start their careers and do not want to spend additional time in school. Additionally, graduating in three years can save students money on tuition and fees, as they will be able to enter the workforce sooner and begin earning a salary.

However, there are also some drawbacks to graduating from high school in three years. One of the biggest concerns is the legal status of students who graduate before the age of 18. In many states, 18 is the legal age to graduate from high school, and students who graduate before this age may not have the same legal rights and protections as those who graduate at the traditional age. Additionally, students who graduate in three years may not have had the same level of education and preparation as those who graduate at the traditional age, which could impact their ability to succeed in the workforce.

Another drawback of graduating in three years is the financial impact on students. While graduating sooner can save money on tuition and fees, it can also lead to a lack of credit. Many colleges and universities require students to take pre-credit courses in order to graduate, which can be expensive and time-consuming. Additionally, students who graduate in three years may not have had the same level of financial preparation as those who graduate at the traditional age, which could impact their ability to manage their finances and make informed decisions about their future.

In conclusion, graduating from high school in three years has both benefits and drawbacks. While it may seem like a great opportunity to get ahead, students must consider the legal statuses, financial concerns, and pre-credit courses that come with this option. Ultimately, students should carefully weigh the pros and cons and make a decision that is best for their individual needs and goals.",1,0.9933869,1,True

Anyway, I think about this a lot because of this dude named Martin Luther King. He was like, this super important civil rights leader who showed everyone that you can make a difference without being mean or violent. He was all about nonviolent protests and stuff, and he totally inspired me and millions of other people to stand up for what's right.

But here's the thing – he didn't just talk the talk, he walked the walk too. He didn't just preach about equality and justice, he put his own life on the line to fight for it. He got arrested and stuff, but he never gave up. And that's what's so cool about him – he showed us that if we stand up for what we believe in, no matter what, we can make a real difference.

And it's not just about big things like civil rights. It's about the little things too, like being kind to someone who's having a bad day or standing up to a bully. If you set a good example, people are more likely to follow it. And if enough people do it, we can make our school, our community, and our world a better place.

I know I'm just a kid, but I try to set a good example every day. I try to be kind to everyone, even if they're not always kind to me. And I try to stand up for what's right, even if it's hard. It's not always easy, but it's important.

So, yeah, setting a good example is super important. It can inspire others to do the same, and before you know it, we can make a real difference. And who knows, maybe one day we'll look back and be like, ""Wow, we did it! We made the world a better place!"" (giggles)

llama_70b_v11023,"In today's digital age, social media has become an integral part of our lives. While social media platforms offer numerous benefits, such as staying connected with friends and family, sharing experiences, and discovering new interests, they also pose significant risks to our privacy. With the rise of social media, there has been an increase in the amount of personal information shared online, which has raised concerns about privacy protection. In this essay, I will argue for the need for stronger privacy protections on social media.

One of the primary concerns with social media is the amount of personal information that users share online. Users often share their location, contact information, and personal photos, which can be accessed by strangers, hackers, and even data mining companies. This information can be used for malicious purposes such as identity theft, stalking, and online harassment. For instance, a study by the Pew Research Center found that 60% of users between the ages of 18 and 29 have shared their contact information, such as their phone number or email address, on social media. This information can be accessed by anyone, including hackers and spammers, who can use it to send spam messages or steal personal information.

Another concern is the use of algorithms by social media companies to collect and analyze user data. Social media companies use algorithms to track user behavior, such as the pages users visit, the posts they like, and the messages they send. This information is used to create targeted ads, which can be intrusive and feel like an invasion of privacy. For example, a study by the Digital Advertising Alliance found that 60% of users feel that online advertising is too intrusive, and 70% of users feel that online advertisers should not be allowed to track their browsing history.

Furthermore, social media companies often have lax data security measures, which can put user data at risk. Data breaches are common, and they can result in the theft of sensitive personal information. For instance, in 2018, Facebook suffered a data breach that exposed the personal information of over 87 million users. This breach included information such as phone numbers, email addresses, and even Facebook login credentials. This highlights the need for stronger privacy protections to safeguard user data.

Moreover, social media companies often share user data with third-party companies, which can lead to further privacy violations. For example, in 2018, it was revealed that the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica had accessed the personal data of millions of Facebook users without their consent. This data was used to create targeted political ads for the 2016 US presidential election. This incident highlights the need for greater transparency and control over how user data is shared and used.

To address these concerns, there are several measures that can be taken to strengthen privacy protections on social media. Firstly, social media companies should be transparent about their data collection practices and provide users with clear and concise information about how their data will be used. Secondly, social media companies should provide users with granular controls over their data, allowing them to decide what information they want to share and with whom. Thirdly, social media companies should implement robust data security measures to protect user data from breaches and cyber attacks. Finally, social media companies should be held accountable for violations of privacy and should face consequences for failing to protect user data.

In conclusion, the rise of social media has led to an increase in the amount of personal information shared online, which has raised significant concerns about privacy protection. Stronger privacy protections are needed to safeguard user data and prevent privacy violations. By implementing measures such as transparency, granular controls, robust data security, and accountability, social media companies can help to protect user privacy and ensure that their platforms are safe and secure for everyone to use.",1,0.9931961,1,True
AC9719A6A375,"Setting a good example by one's own behavior is an effective way to influence others. It is important to understand that our attitudes and behaviors have a significant impact on those around us, and it is our responsibility to set a positive example. In this essay, I will analyze the effectiveness of setting a good example by one's own behavior, focusing on the importance of attitude and behavior, providing accurate information with supporting examples, and the role of face-to-face communication in providing a good example.

Firstly, our attitudes and behaviors are crucial in setting a good example for others. It is essential to have a positive attitude towards life and the people around us. When we have a positive attitude, we are more likely to approach challenges with a can-do attitude, which can inspire others to do the same. For example, if we are facing a difficult project at school, we can set a good example by approaching it with a positive attitude, breaking it down into manageable tasks, and encouraging our classmates to do the same. This can lead to a more productive and enjoyable experience for everyone involved.

Secondly, providing accurate information with supporting examples is an important aspect of setting a good example. When we provide accurate information, we are demonstrating our knowledge and expertise in a particular area. This can inspire others to seek out more information and learn from us. For example, if we are passionate about a particular hobby, we can set a good example by sharing our knowledge and experiences with others. This can lead to a greater appreciation for the hobby and potentially inspire others to try it out for themselves.

Lastly, face-to-face communication is essential in providing a good example. It is important to communicate our attitudes and behaviors clearly and effectively, especially when we are interacting with others in person. This can help to build trust and credibility with those around us. For example, if we are leading a team project, we can set a good example by clearly communicating our expectations and providing feedback in a constructive manner. This can help to ensure that everyone on the team is working towards the same goal and that any issues are addressed in a timely and effective manner.

In conclusion, setting a good example by one's own behavior is an effective way to influence others. It is important to have a positive attitude towards life and the people around us, provide accurate information with supporting examples, and communicate our attitudes and behaviors",1,0.9948185,1,True
falcon_180b_v1_155,"I think that students would really benefit from being able to attend classes from home. One reason is that it gives students a chance to work in a place where they are most comfortable. Some students work better in a quiet place, like their bedroom or living room, where they can concentrate without any distractions from other students. For example, my friend Sarah has a really hard time concentrating in class because of all the noise around her. If she could do classes from home, she could have a quiet space to work in and be much more productive. 

Another reason that distance learning would be good is that students could save a lot of time by not having to travel to and from school every day. This would be especially helpful for students who live far away from their school or who have to take public transportation. For example, my cousin lives in a rural area and has to take a bus to get to school. It takes her two hours to get there and two hours to get back home. If she could do classes from home, she would save four hours of her day that she could use to do other things she needs to do.

Finally, distance learning would be great for students who are sick or who have a disability that makes it hard for them to go to school every day. They wouldn't have to worry about missing classes or falling behind in their work. For example, my neighbor's son has a heart condition and can't go to school every day because he gets tired easily. If he could do classes from home, he could keep up with his work without having to worry about getting too tired.

Overall, I think that distance learning would be a great option for students who want to be more comfortable, save time, or who have a disability or illness that makes it hard to go to school every day.

For example, turtles think plastic bags are jellyfish and eat them, which can kill them. Also, plastic takes a long time to break down, so it just piles up in landfills and oceans.

Another reason we should stop using single-use plastics is that they are not really necessary. We can use reusable bags, water bottles, and straws instead. My mom always carries a reusable bag in her purse, and she never has to worry about forgetting a bag at the store. My dad uses a reusable water bottle, and he says it's way better than buying bottled water all the time.

Some people might say that single-use plastics are convenient, but I think it's not worth the harm they cause. We can make small changes in our daily lives to help protect the environment. For instance, I always try to remember to bring my reusable straw with me when I go to the restaurant. It's not that hard, and it makes a big difference.

Furthermore, single-use plastics are not good for our health either. Some plastics contain chemicals that can leak into our food and water, which can make us sick. My teacher told us that some plastic containers contain BPA, which can cause cancer. That's scary!

Finally, banning single-use plastics would help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Plastic production requires a lot of energy, which comes from burning fossil fuels. By using less plastic, we can reduce our carbon footprint and help stop climate change.

In conclusion, single-use plastics are bad for the environment, our health, and our planet. We should stop using them and switch to reusable alternatives. It's a small change, but it can make a big difference.",1,0.030280711,0,False
6E5F280580C4,"Distance learning options have become increasingly popular over the past decade, with growing numbers of students relying on online or video conferencing classes to attend school from home. While the ability to learn from one's own home offers numerous advantages - such as increased flexibility, lower costs, and more control over one's schedule - there are still a number of potential issues that must be taken into account, such as the potential for students to become easily distracted or procrastinate. 

It is important to consider both the positive and negative impacts of distance learning. On one hand, there is evidence that distance learning can offer superior academic outcomes due to the focus that students have while working independently. In addition, many students who may feel overwhelmed by the more traditional environment find increased comfort and freedom in the home-based setting. On the other hand, there is also the potential for this type of learning to lead to poorer academic performance due to the lack of social interaction and peer motivation.

In conclusion, although there are both positives and negatives when it comes to providing distance learning options, the pros do appear to outweigh the cons.

Hey there, folks! Today, I wanna talk about something that I think is super important for success in life: having a positive attitude. Now, I know some of you might be thinking, ""Ugh, positivity is so overrated. Can't we just focus on the grades and the college apps and stuff?""

First of all, having a positive attitude means that you're more likely to take risks and try new things. Like, think about it. If you're always thinking, ""Oh no, I'm gonna fail,"" then you're never gonna take that leap of faith and try something new. But if you're like, ""Hey, I might mess up, but I'm gonna give it my all!"" then you're way more likely to take risks and try new things. And that's how you learn and grow, you know?

Another thing is that having a positive attitude can help you deal with challenges way better. Like, let's say you're working on a super hard project for school, and you're feeling super stressed out and overwhelmed. If you have a positive attitude, you're like, ""Okay, this is tough, but I can do it!"" And then you're way more likely to push through and actually finish the project. But if you're like, ""Ugh, this is so hard and I'm never gonna finish,"" then you're gonna give up way faster.

If you're always thinking, ""Oh man, I hate this,"" or ""This is so boring,"" then you're never gonna enjoy anything. But if you're like, ""Hey, this is cool!"" or ""I'm so excited for this,"" then you're way more likely to enjoy yourself and have fun.

Hard work and determination are crucial factors that contribute to success in any aspect of life. Whether it is in academics, sports, or personal goals, these traits are essential for achieving one's objectives. In this essay, I will discuss the importance of hard work and determination for success, provide a personal example of when I had to fight for a goal, explore an influential person who achieved success through hard work and perseverance, and analyze the implications of hard work for accomplishing goals and feeling pride.

Firstly, hard work and determination are essential for success because they demonstrate a commitment to achieving one's goals. Successful individuals understand that success is not handed to them, but rather it is earned through dedication and hard work. By consistently working towards a goal, individuals can overcome obstacles and setbacks, which can ultimately lead to success.

Secondly, I have had a personal experience of fighting for a goal. When I was in high school, I had a dream of becoming a varsity athlete. However, I was not the most talented athlete on the team, and I struggled to keep up with my teammates during practices. Despite this, I was determined to become a varsity athlete. I spent countless hours practicing and working on my skills, and I pushed myself to be the best athlete I could be. Eventually, my hard work paid off, and I made the varsity team. This experience taught me the importance of perseverance and determination in achieving one's goals.

Thirdly, there are many influential people who have achieved success through hard work and perseverance. One such person is J.K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter series. Rowling faced many challenges and rejections before finally finding a publisher for her first book. However, she was determined to see her dream come true and continued to work on her writing. Today, the Harry Potter series is one of the most successful book series of all time, and J.K. Rowling is a billionaire.

Some people believe that these programs are a waste of time and money, while others argue that they provide numerous benefits to students. In my opinion, afterschool programs have several advantages that can improve the lives of students.

One of the most significant advantages of afterschool programs is that they can help students improve their skills. These programs provide students with an opportunity to learn new things and develop their talents. For example, many afterschool programs offer music, art, and sports classes, which can help students discover their passions and develop their skills. Additionally, some programs provide tutoring and academic support, which can help students improve their grades and test scores.

Another advantage of afterschool programs is that they can make homework easier. Homework can be a stressful and time-consuming task for many students. However, afterschool programs can provide a supportive environment where students can work on their homework and get help when they need it. For example, some programs offer homework help sessions where students can work on their assignments with a tutor or teacher.

Finally, afterschool programs can be particularly helpful for students with disabilities. These programs can provide a safe and inclusive environment where students with disabilities can learn and grow. For example, some programs offer specialized classes for students with learning disabilities, where they can receive individualized attention and support. Additionally, some programs provide adaptive sports and recreational activities for students with physical disabilities.

Firstly, arts education helps to develop creativity and imagination in students. It allows them to express themselves in ways that other subjects do not. For example, through music, dance, drama, and visual arts, students can explore their emotions, thoughts, and ideas in a unique and meaningful way. This kind of self-expression is crucial for personal growth and development.

Secondly, arts education fosters critical thinking skills. In order to create or appreciate art, one must analyze, interpret, and evaluate various elements such as form, content, style, and technique. These analytical skills are transferable to other areas of study and life, making arts education an invaluable asset to any student's intellectual development.

Lastly, arts education promotes cultural understanding and appreciation. By exposing students to different forms of art from various cultures and time periods, they gain a deeper understanding and respect for diversity. This understanding is essential in our increasingly globalized world, where cross-cultural communication and collaboration are becoming more common.

In conclusion, arts education should be considered an essential part of every student's education. Its benefits extend beyond the classroom, helping students to develop important life skills and become well-rounded individuals.",1,0.99419653,1,True

While some argue that curfews are necessary to keep teenagers safe, others believe that they stifle personal freedom and can even lead to more trouble. However, there are benefits to enforcing curfews for teenagers who do not get into trouble, and activities or resources can be implemented to ensure that they are staying out of trouble.

One of the main benefits of enforcing curfews for teenagers who do not get into trouble is that it helps them develop a sense of responsibility.

By setting a curfew, parents can ensure that their child has enough time to complete homework and study for exams. This can help teenagers maintain good grades and prepare for their future.

In addition to enforcing curfews, there are activities and resources that can be implemented to ensure that teenagers are staying out of trouble. For example, parents can encourage their child to participate in extracurricular activities, such as sports or clubs. These activities can provide teenagers with a sense of purpose and belonging, which can help them stay out of trouble.

Parents can also provide their child with access to resources such as tutoring or counseling. These resources can help teenagers develop the skills they need to succeed academically and emotionally, which can help them avoid getting into trouble.

In conclusion, enforcing curfews for teenagers who do not get into trouble can have several benefits. By developing a sense of responsibility and staying focused on their studies, teenagers can avoid getting into trouble and stay on the right path. Additionally, activities and resources such as extracurricular activities and counseling can help teenagers stay out of trouble and achieve their full potential.",1,0.9943551,1,True
C24F3DD7A37E,"Hey, so I'm gonna write this essay about how having a good attitude can be super important, even when things are tough. Like, I know it can be easy to get down when stuff isn't going your way, but if you have a good attitude, it can make all the difference.

First of all, having a good attitude can make you successful. Like, if you're always positive and stuff, people are gonna wanna be around you and stuff. They're gonna wanna work with you and stuff, 'cause you're gonna be fun to be around. And that means you're gonna have more opportunities, 'cause people are gonna wanna help you out and stuff. And that's how you get ahead in life, right?

And it's not just about getting ahead, it's also about being strong. When things are tough, if you have a good attitude, you can handle it. You can be like, ""Yeah, this is tough, but I can do it."" And then you can do it, 'cause you believe in yourself. And that's when you're at your strongest, when you're like, ""I can handle anything.""

And it's not just about you, it's also about how you can help others. When you have a good attitude, you're more likely to help people out, 'cause you're in a good mood and stuff. And that's when you can make a difference in people's lives, 'cause you're being nice and stuff. And that's when you can make a real impact, 'cause you're not just thinking about yourself, you're thinking about others too.

And let me tell you, it's not just like, ""Oh, good attitudes are nice and stuff."" It's like, they can lead to amazing experiences. Like, if you have a good attitude, you're more likely to take risks and stuff, and that's when you can have the most fun. And that's when you can have the best experiences, 'cause you're not just stuck in one place, you're out there doing stuff and living life.

llama_70b_v1987,"Hey there! I'm a 6th grader and I'm here to share my thoughts on renewable energy. So, there's been a lot of talk about switching from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. Some people think it's a great idea, while others aren't so sure. Let me tell you why I think it's a good idea to make the switch.

First of all, renewable energy is, well, renewable! That means it won't run out like fossil fuels will. We can keep using it over and over again without worrying about it disappearing. Plus, it's way better for the environment. Fossil fuels release bad stuff like carbon dioxide into the air, which contributes to climate change. But renewable energy sources like solar and wind power don't do that. They're like superheroes for the planet!

Another thing is that renewable energy is getting cheaper and cheaper. Like, have you seen those cool solar panels on people's roofs? They're way more affordable than they used to be. And companies are even investing in renewable energy because it's becoming more cost-effective. It's like, why not choose the cheaper, cleaner option?

Now, some people might say that renewable energy isn't always available, like when it's cloudy or the wind isn't blowing. But that's not a good enough reason to stick with fossil fuels. We can figure out ways to store the energy, like in big batteries or something. And scientists are working on making renewable energy more reliable all the time.

Okay, so some people might also say that switching to renewable energy will be hard and take a long time. But that's not true! We can start by using renewable energy for little things, like powering our homes or schools. And then we can gradually switch over to bigger things, like cars and factories. It'll take some time, but it's totally doable.

In conclusion, we should totally make the switch to renewable energy. It's better for the planet, it's getting cheaper, and it's not as hard as people think. So, let's do this! Let's be the superheroes of the planet and save the world with renewable energy! 💪🌟🌱",1,0.9932314,1,True
falcon_180b_v1_941,"""I think that homework is a crucial part of learning. While some people argue that it causes stress among students, I believe that it has more benefits than drawbacks. Homework helps to reinforce what is taught in class, and it prepares students for the rigors of the working world. Moreover, it allows students to develop important academic and life skills, such as time management, organization, and self-discipline.

For instance, when students are given homework, they are encouraged to study, research, think critically, and practice problem-solving. This means that they are not simply learning by rote or repetition, but through active engagement with course content. Homework provides students with a chance to review their notes and textbooks, apply their knowledge, and seek help where necessary. By doing this, they become more confident in their abilities and better equipped to handle complex academic tasks.

Furthermore, homework promotes self-sufficiency and responsibility among learners. It teaches them to plan their schedules, prioritize tasks, set goals, and meet deadlines. These abilities are essential in life because they enable individuals to be successful in their personal and professional endeavors. Without homework, students may not develop the motivation, discipline, or perseverance needed to achieve their objectives.

However, it is true that too much homework can lead to stress and anxiety among students. This is particularly true if the workload is unrealistic or if it interferes with other aspects of their lives. Therefore, teachers need to be reasonable and fair when assigning homework, taking into account students' different abilities and circumstances.

In conclusion, homework is a vital aspect of education that provides students with numerous benefits. It helps students learn, develop important academic and life skills, and prepare for the future. While it can be stressful at times, it is an essential tool for academic and personal success. As a result, students should learn to embrace homework and use it as an opportunity to improve themselves.",1,0.99446267,1,True

As Prime Minister Winston Churchill famously said, “Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.” Knowing that failure can lead to success, and not believing in giving up, is an essential factor in achieving our goals. 

Agreeing with Churchill’s attitude, resilience is required when pursuing a task. When things don’t go as planned it can be disheartening, but it’s important to keep pushing through and keep working towards the desired outcome. Often, the path to success is full of obstacles and failure. One must be willing to view these challenges as bumps in the road and opportunities to become better and strive towards bigger goals. 

Encouraging oneself to keep going even after making mistakes and discouraging situations is a trait that can be learned. Positivity and dedication can help propel even the hardest tasks, and being open-minded and understanding that it takes timing and dedication is important for success.

Dear [Senator's Name],

Subject: The Importance of the Electoral College in Presidential Elections

I am writing to express my strong support for the Electoral College system as the method for choosing the President of the United States. While some argue for a change to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College is a crucial component of our democratic process and offers significant benefits.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures the certainty of outcome in the presidential elections. As explained by Judge Richard A. Posner in his article, ""The Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President,"" the winner of the Electoral College typically receives a higher share of the electoral vote compared to their share of the popular vote. This provides a clear mandate for the elected president and reduces the likelihood of disputes or uncertainty surrounding the election results.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it fosters the notion of ""everyone's president."" With its requirement of trans-regional appeal, the Electoral College prevents candidates from focusing solely on winning particular regions. This ensures that the elected president represents the interests of the entire nation, rather than just a few populous areas. By avoiding a situation where candidates can win the presidency by appealing only to specific regions, the Electoral College promotes the well-rounded leadership that our country needs.

Moreover, the Electoral College system encourages candidates to pay attention to swing states. In his article, Judge Posner explains that the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to campaign in toss-up states, where the outcome is uncertain. This forces candidates to listen to and engage with voters in these states, making them more thoughtful and informed voters. By giving swing states a significant role in deciding the election, the Electoral College ensures that the concerns and priorities of these crucial states are addressed.

Furthermore, the Electoral College allows for the inclusion of larger states in the presidential election process. As Judge Posner points out, the mal-apportionment of the Senate in the Constitution means that larger states lose weight in terms of political balance. The Electoral College helps to balance this by providing a mechanism for larger states to receive more attention from presidential candidates. This ensures that the interests of both large and small states are taken into account, promoting a more inclusive democracy.

Lastly, the Electoral College prevents the need for run-off elections. With its winner-take-all approach, the Electoral College invariably produces a clear winner without the need for further rounds of voting. This eliminates the complexity and potential complications that may arise from run-off elections and allows for a smooth and efficient presidential election process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a crucial aspect of our democracy. It ensures the certainty of outcome, fosters a president for everyone, encourages attention to swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While the system is not perfect, it offers significant advantages over a direct popular vote. I urge you to support the continuation of the Electoral College system as it plays a vital role in our democratic process.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will consider the information presented in this letter when formulating your stance on this issue.

falcon_180b_v1_869,"As a student in grade 10, I have been exposed to the growing movement advocating for the reduction of meat consumption due to environmental and health concerns. The issue has sparked a debate among people, with some advocating for a vegetarian or vegan diet, while others argue against it. In my opinion, I believe that adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet is a better choice for both our health and the environment.

Firstly, adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet can help improve our health. A diet that is rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes can provide all the nutrients the body needs without the harmful effects of meat consumption. A study conducted by the American Heart Association shows that people who consume a plant-based diet have a lower risk of heart disease, stroke, and some types of cancer. Additionally, a vegetarian or vegan diet can also help manage weight and prevent obesity, which is a major health concern in today's society.

Secondly, adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet can benefit the environment. Meat production is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, water pollution, and other environmental problems. A report by the United Nations shows that the meat industry is responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than all the transportation in the world combined. By reducing meat consumption, we can help reduce the environmental impact and promote sustainability.

However, some people argue against adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet, claiming that meat contains essential nutrients that cannot be obtained from plant-based foods. For example, meat is a good source of protein, iron, and vitamin B12. While this is true, these nutrients can also be obtained from plant-based sources. For example, protein can be found in beans, lentils, and tofu, while iron can be found in spinach, kale, and other leafy greens. Additionally, vitamin B12 supplements can be taken to ensure that the body gets enough of this essential nutrient.

In conclusion, I believe that adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet is a better choice for both our health and the environment. While some people may argue against it, the benefits of reducing meat consumption cannot be ignored. By eating a plant-based diet, we can improve our health and promote sustainability for future generations.",1,0.99347395,1,True

However, the question remains whether being constantly active or taking breaks is more beneficial in achieving these goals. In my opinion, a combination of both approaches is necessary to accomplish more in life.

Firstly, staying on track in school is crucial to academic success. Students who are constantly active and engaged in their studies tend to perform better academically. They are more likely to attend class, complete assignments on time, and participate in extracurricular activities. However, it is also important to take breaks and allow ourselves time to rest and recharge. Taking a break from studying can help prevent burnout and improve focus and productivity when we return to our work.

Secondly, working hard like a parent is essential to achieving personal and professional goals. Parents who are constantly active and engaged in their children's lives tend to have more successful children. They are more likely to be involved in their children's education, provide a stable home environment, and set a good example for their children to follow. Similarly, individuals who work hard and are constantly active in their careers tend to achieve more success and advancement opportunities. However, it is also important to take breaks and allow ourselves time to relax and recharge. Taking a break from work can help prevent burnout and improve job satisfaction when we return to our work.

Finally, getting things done like a soccer player requires a combination of both approaches. Soccer players who are constantly active and engaged in their training tend to perform better on the field. They are more likely to practice regularly, stay in shape, and develop their skills.

Taking a break from training can help prevent injuries and improve performance when we return to our training.

In conclusion, being constantly active or taking breaks is necessary to accomplish more in life. A combination of both approaches is necessary to achieve success in school, work, and other areas of life.

ED74D2C2403B,"One of the main benefits of attending physical classes rather than taking classes from home is the lack of distractions available. Online classes may offer a feeling of convenience, but without a physical teacher present, it's up to the student to ensure that they are completely focused on the task at hand. It can be difficult to stay concentrated in a comfortable home environment, particularly when distractions such as television, the internet, and social media are just a few clicks away. Without a teacher present to redirect their focus onto the task, it's easy for students to get sidetracked and miss important points. 

Having an actual teacher to ask questions of and receive feedback from is also a big part of the learning process. In a classroom setting, students have the opportunity to ask questions in real-time and get feedback on their work from a trained professional. Conversely, taking classes from home does not provide the same level of opportunity for students to ask questions, get clarification, and receive immediate feedback on completed assignments. This can hamper their learning by limiting their understanding of the material and preventing them from getting the most out of the class.

Finally, attending physical classes rather than taking classes from home also provides more time and opportunity to learn. In a physical class, students are able to take advantage of lunch, recess, and after-school programs that may not otherwise be possible when they are learning from home. This additional time to learn allows for greater comprehension of class material and encourages further exploration and experimentation with concepts. 

Overall, taking classes from home can be detrimental to student learning. While it may offer some level of convenience, physical classes allow students to take advantage of having a physical teacher to ask questions of, immediate feedback on their work, and additional time and opportunity to learn.

falcon_180b_v1_973,"""I do not agree that video games can contribute to violent behavior. There are many other factors that contribute to violence and aggression in individuals, such as personal experiences or mental health issues. Video games alone cannot be held responsible for causing violence.

Firstly, most video games are designed with a rating system that indicates the level of violence or appropriateness for different age groups. This ensures that players are aware of the content they will be exposed to and can choose to play games that are suitable for them. It is the responsibility of parents or guardians to monitor their child's gaming habits and ensure they are playing games that are age-appropriate.

Secondly, video games can actually have beneficial effects on behavior. Many games require problem-solving and critical thinking skills, which can improve cognitive abilities. Some games also promote teamwork and cooperation, encouraging players to work together towards a common goal. These positive aspects of gaming should be considered when discussing the impact of video games on behavior.

Finally, there is a lack of strong evidence linking video games directly to violent behavior. Studies have shown mixed results, with some suggesting a correlation between violent games and aggression, while others find no significant relationship. It is important to consider these conflicting findings before jumping to conclusions about the impact of video games on behavior.

Action needs to be taken to provide victims of child abuse with appropriate medical and legal assistance. It is also imperative to promote awareness about the consequences of child abuse, so that people in positions of authority or authority figures, such as teachers and healthcare professionals, can identify when a child is in danger and take the necessary steps to protect them. It is also important to provide more access to family and social services, such as counseling, legal advice, and educational interventions so that victims of abuse can receive the help they need.

Subject: The Electoral College and the Future of Presidential Elections

Dear [State Senator’s Last Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the controversial topic of the Electoral College and to urge you to consider the importance of its preservation. While many argue for a shift towards a popular vote system, I firmly believe that the Electoral College serves as a vital institution in our democratic process. By analyzing information from multiple sources, I will present a compelling case for maintaining the Electoral College system.

First and foremost, the Electoral College provides a certainty of outcome that a direct popular vote cannot guarantee. As Judge Richard A. Posner explains, the winner-take-all basis of electoral votes in most states ensures that the candidate with the majority of electoral votes also has a significant lead in the popular vote. This not only eliminates the possibility of a disputed outcome, as seen in the 2000 election, but also prevents the need for potentially divisive run-off elections, which could complicate an already complex presidential election process.

Furthermore, the Electoral College fosters a sense of national representation by requiring presidential candidates to appeal to a diverse range of voters. As Posner argues, a candidate with only regional support is unlikely to be an effective president, as residents of other regions may feel disenfranchised and believe that their interests will not be adequately represented. This system demands that candidates campaign in different states and ensures that no single region can dictate the outcome of the election. The Electoral College safeguards against regional biases and encourages candidates to understand and address issues of national importance.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is its provision for swing states. In states where the race is tight, voters pay closer attention to the campaign and are more likely to be informed about the candidates' positions. This heightened engagement leads to more thoughtful voting decisions and the selection of candidates who can appeal to a wider range of Americans. The focus on swing states promotes a fair and balanced campaign discourse, enhancing the democratic process by ensuring that every vote counts and that candidates cannot simply rely on overwhelming support from a particular demographic or geographic area. 

Additionally, the Electoral College safeguards the interests of smaller states, which would otherwise be overshadowed in a system based solely on the popular vote. According to Posner, the apportionment of electoral votes rewards larger states with increased attention from candidates. This balanced representation compensates for the mal-apportionment of the Senate and ensures that every state has a voice in determining the outcome of the election. Under a popular vote system, candidates would prioritize heavily populated states, potentially ignoring the concerns and needs of less populous regions.

Finally, it is important to remember that voter turnout is not solely dependent on the potential influence of one's vote. As evidenced by the 2012 election, in which around one-half of eligible Americans voted, it is clear that citizens are motivated to participate and express their political preferences, despite the knowledge that their individual vote may not determine the outcome of the election. Eliminating the Electoral College to solely rely on a popular vote would not significantly impact overall voter engagement.

In conclusion, the Electoral College should be retained as an integral part of our presidential election process. It provides certainty of outcome, ensures national representation, promotes thoughtful voting decisions, balances the interests of large and small states, and does not diminish voter engagement. While the system may not be perfect, it has proven to be a fair and effective way of electing presidents for over two centuries. I urge you to consider the multiple benefits of the Electoral College system in order to preserve the integrity of our democratic process.

Thank you for your time and consideration of this important matter.

Making our own decisions gives us the opportunity to experience new things and try new things, which can help us to grow and develop as individuals. Taking risks and trying something new teaches us more about ourselves and leads to experiences that could not be gained from following advice. 

Making our own decisions also teaches us valuable life lessons that cannot be received from relying solely on the advice of adults. When we are allowed to make our own decisions, we learn how to handle successes and failures without relying on external sources. We are able to learn our personal limits, and form our own opinions about what we deem successful or unsuccessful. We become more resilient and are able to develop confidence in our own decisions and abilities. 

Without the opportunity to make our own decisions and learn from our mistakes, teenagers cannot gain knowledge of the consequences of our actions and develop an understanding of our own values and views. Learning from our mistakes rather than relying on the advice of adults helps teenagers become responsible, independent individuals that can make appropriate decisions.",1,0.9948207,1,True

Subject: The Electoral College vs. Election by Popular Vote

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. My name is [Your Name], and I am a concerned citizen of [State]. I am writing to express my views on the debate surrounding the Electoral College and the possibility of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. After carefully considering the information from various sources, including the texts ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, and ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Judge Richard A. Posner, I argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College for the following reasons.

First and foremost, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome. Despite occasional disputes over the outcome, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College consistently exceeds their share of the popular vote. This system ensures a clear winner with a majority of electoral votes, minimizing the likelihood of protracted disputes. Although the popular vote winner may not always win the presidency, such instances have been scarce throughout history. The rarity of such occurrences suggests that the Electoral College generally reflects the will of the people and produces an undisputed outcome.

Secondly, the Electoral College promotes the concept of ""everyone's president."" In an era of increasing regionalism, it is essential that a presidential candidate has trans-regional appeal. The Electoral College forces candidates to campaign beyond their solid regional bases and appeals to voters from different regions. This ensures that the president represents the interests of the entire nation and not just a few concentrated areas. By preventing candidates with only regional appeal from becoming presidents, this system promotes unity and a balanced representation of diverse perspectives.

Moreover, the focus on swing states in presidential campaigns, thanks to the winner-take-all method, ensures that voters in these states receive special attention. Swing states often play a crucial role in deciding the outcome of elections, leading to greater voter engagement and informed decision-making. By allocating campaign efforts to these states, the Electoral College encourages candidates to address issues that are important to swing state voters, resulting in a more thoughtful and well-informed electorate.

Additionally, the Electoral College restores some balance to the political power of large and small states. The mal-apportionment of the Senate, as decreed by the Constitution, grants small states more influence in the political process than their population would suggest. The Electoral College further amplifies this balance by providing larger states with more attention from presidential candidates during campaigns. This ensures that the concerns and interests of both small and large states are heard and considered in the election process.

Lastly, the Electoral College allows for clear winners and avoids the need for run-off elections. In scenarios where no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, run-off elections can significantly complicate the election process. The Electoral College, by design, leads to a clear winner who secures the majority of the electoral votes. This avoids the need for additional rounds of voting and ensures a swift, decisive outcome for the nation.

In conclusion, the Electoral College has proven to be an effective and balanced system for electing the president of the United States. It provides certainty of outcome, promotes the concept of ""everyone's president,"" encourages voter engagement in swing states, restores balance between large and small states, and avoids the complexities of run-off elections. While concerns about fairness and representation are valid, the Electoral College continues to be a necessary compromise that merits preservation.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my views on this important matter. I trust that you will make an informed decision that upholds the best interests of our state and nation. I look forward to witnessing the positive outcomes that the Electoral College can continue to deliver in our democratic process.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1,0.61644644,1,True
E0B4FCC6FD58,"Working in a group versus working alone on an assigned task has been a topic of debate among students and professionals alike. While some people argue that working in a group is more effective, others believe that working alone is the best approach. In this essay, I will compare the pros and cons of each approach and argue that working alone is the best approach for completing an assigned task.

One of the main benefits of working in a group is the ability to share ideas and perspectives. When working with a group of people, each individual brings their own unique perspective and experiences to the table. This can lead to a more well-rounded and creative solution to the task at hand. Additionally, working in a group can provide a sense of community and support. When working with others, it can be easier to share struggles and seek help when needed.

However, working in a group also has its drawbacks. One of the main disadvantages is the potential for groupthink. When a group of people are working together, they may become too focused on reaching a consensus and may overlook alternative solutions or ideas. This can lead to a less effective solution and a lack of creativity. Additionally, working in a group can be time-consuming and may require more communication and coordination than working alone.

On the other hand, working alone has its own set of benefits. One of the main advantages is the ability to work at your own pace and in your own style. When working alone, you have complete control over how you approach the task and can tailor your work to your own strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, working alone can be less distracting and allow for a more focused work environment.

However, working alone also has its drawbacks. One of the main disadvantages is the potential for isolation. When working alone, it can be difficult to get feedback and support from others. This can lead to a lack of accountability and may result in a less effective solution. Additionally, working alone can be lonely and may not provide the same sense of community and support as working in a group.

In conclusion, both working in a group and working alone have their own set of benefits and drawbacks. While working in a group can provide a sense of community and support, it can also lead to groupthink and a lack of creativity. Working alone, on the other hand, allows for more control and focus, but can also lead to isolation and a",1,0.9942555,1,True
CB4C85EFAE67,"The great philosopher, Waldo Emerson, once said “Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow”. This statement is profound and true, as it acknowledges the importance of pushing ourselves further towards our greatest potential. In order to grow, we must be willing to go beyond our comfort zone and traverse unfamiliar territory in order to broaden our horizons and personal development.

For example, if I wished to become a professional software engineer, I would need to take on a variety of different tasks far beyond what I already know. Without continuing to learn and develop my knowledge and skills beyond what I am already comfortable with, I would not be able to progress in my career in any meaningful way. Taking on challenges in a specific area forces us to think critically, refining our existing skillset and learning new ones that will support our growth.

Emerson's statement also applies to our personal lives. Whether it’s in our hobbies, our relationships, or even our daily habits, if we keep doing the same thing over and over again, we won’t experience growth or improve our individual circumstances. We need to challenge ourselves to step up and take on something new and exciting that will encourage us to think outside the box. Trying something beyond our current capabilities will develop our confidence and skill, allowing us to develop and reach our potential. 

In summary, Waldo Emerson’s statement of “Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow” is profound and true. To grow, we must be willing to step outside of our comfort zone and take on unfamiliar challenges. Whether it’s professionally or personally, by pushing our boundaries, we will be setting ourselves up for personal and professional betterment.",1,0.99419844,1,True
llama_70b_v1865,"The transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy is a pressing issue that has gained significant attention in recent years. While some argue that renewable energy is the key to a sustainable future, others claim that it is not feasible or efficient enough to meet our energy demands. In this essay, I will argue in favor of the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy, providing reasons and examples to support my position.

First and foremost, renewable energy is a sustainable and environmentally friendly source of energy. Unlike fossil fuels, which release harmful greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power do not produce any emissions. This means that renewable energy can significantly reduce our carbon footprint and help combat climate change. For instance, a study by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found that transitioning to 100% renewable energy in the United States could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 70%.

Secondly, renewable energy is becoming increasingly cost-effective. While the initial investment in renewable energy infrastructure can be expensive, the long-term benefits far outweigh the costs. The cost of solar and wind energy has decreased dramatically in recent years, making it more competitive with fossil fuels. In fact, a report by the Solar Energy Industries Association found that the cost of solar energy has fallen by 70% since 2010. Additionally, renewable energy creates jobs and stimulates local economies, providing a boost to communities that adopt it.

Thirdly, renewable energy promotes energy independence. Relying on local renewable energy sources reduces our dependence on foreign oil and mitigates the risks associated with price volatility. This is particularly important for remote communities that rely on expensive and polluting diesel generators for power. By transitioning to renewable energy, these communities can reduce their energy costs and improve their energy security.

Finally, renewable energy is becoming increasingly efficient. Advances in technology have led to the development of more efficient solar panels, wind turbines, and energy storage systems. This means that we can generate more energy from the same amount of sunlight or wind, making renewable energy a more viable option for meeting our energy demands.

In conclusion, the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy is a necessary step towards a sustainable future. Renewable energy is sustainable, cost-effective, promotes energy independence, and is becoming increasingly efficient. While there may be challenges to overcome, the benefits of renewable energy far outweigh the drawbacks. As a society, we must embrace this transition and work towards a future powered by clean, renewable energy.",1,0.99380624,1,True
E3097287CBD1,"It is clear that traditional in-person educational instruction and distance learning instruction both have their own unique pros and cons. In-person instruction offers a more engaging and interactive learning experience, which is important in making sure that students have a thorough and comprehensive understanding of the material, while distance learning can be more convenient for students since they can learn anywhere with an internet connection. Additionally, distance learning provides more flexibility and can be beneficial for those with financial or mobility restraints. 

On the other hand, students may have difficulty staying motivated and engaged with their own learning when taking online classes. Some may not receive sufficient assistance and guidance from the instructors, or have difficulty staying organized and meeting deadlines. In-person instruction also allows for socialization and collaboration with classmates, which can be an important part of the learning experience.

Given the current educational climate, distance learning has become a popular choice for learning. However, it is worth considering the possible implications it may have for student learning and development. Distance learning can provide a number of advantages, but it may come with its own set of challenges as well. Therefore, students and their families should be mindful and consider all the ramifications of distance learning before making a decision. Personally, I believe a combination of distance learning and in-person instruction is ideal, as each has unique benefits that can contribute to a student’s long-term academic success.",1,0.993334,1,True
F17DDEB77A2A,"Summer vacations are a time for students to recharge and refresh their minds from the rigors of the school year. While some may argue that summer vacations are a waste of time, I believe that they have numerous advantages for students. In this essay, I will discuss the benefits of familiar activities, job opportunities, and balancing students' personal and school lives. Additionally, I will explore the importance of finding an appropriate length of break to maximize students' progress.

One of the main advantages of summer vacations is the opportunity to engage in familiar activities. For many students, summer is a time to return to hobbies and interests that they may not have had time for during the school year. Whether it's playing sports, reading, or painting, these activities provide a sense of comfort and familiarity that can be beneficial for students' mental and emotional well-being. Engaging in these activities can also help students to develop their skills and talents, which can lead to greater success in school and beyond.

Another advantage of summer vacations is the increased job opportunities available to students. Many businesses and organizations offer summer internships and part-time jobs for students, which can provide valuable work experience and help them to develop important skills such as communication, teamwork, and time management. These experiences can also help students to make connections in their field of interest, which can be beneficial for their future career prospects.

Finally, summer vacations provide students with the opportunity to balance their personal and school lives. With the increased free time, students can focus on their academic pursuits and catch up on any missed work. They can also use this time to spend with friends and family, which can help to reduce stress and improve their overall well-being. Additionally, summer vacations can provide a much-needed break from the pressures of school, which can help students to return to class feeling refreshed and ready to learn.

However, it's important to note that the length of summer vacation can have an impact on students' progress. While longer vacations may provide more opportunities for relaxation and personal pursuits, they can also lead to a loss of academic momentum. On the other hand, shorter vacations may not provide enough time for students to recharge and may lead to increased stress and burnout. Therefore, it's important for students and educators to find a balance that works for them, taking into consideration the needs",1,0.99444145,1,True

Please provide feedback on the essay, including suggestions for improvement and a grade level appropriate for the writing.

Thank you.

The essay provides a clear opinion on the topic of dress codes and offers some valid reasons to support the writer's position. However, there are some areas that could be improved upon to make the essay more effective and polished.

Firstly, the essay could benefit from a clearer introduction that sets up the topic and provides some background information on dress codes. Additionally, the writer could have used more specific examples to support their arguments, rather than relying on general statements. For instance, they could have described a specific situation where a dress code was effective in promoting a positive learning environment.

Furthermore, the essay could benefit from more organized paragraphs. The writer jumps between different ideas within the same paragraph, making it difficult to follow their train of thought. It would be more effective to have separate paragraphs for each point the writer wants to make.

Lastly, there are several spelling and grammar mistakes throughout the essay that detract from the overall quality of the writing. The writer should proofread their work carefully to ensure that there are no errors.

Grade level appropriate for the writing: 6th-7th grade

Suggestions for improvement:

* Provide a clear introduction that sets up the topic and provides background information on dress codes.
* Use more specific examples to support arguments.
* Organize the essay into clear paragraphs, each focusing on one point.
* Proofread the essay carefully to eliminate spelling and grammar mistakes.
* Consider adding more details and evidence to make the essay more persuasive.
* Use more varied sentence structures and vocabulary to make the writing more engaging.",1,0.9922402,1,True
8A0A3FE01FE7,"As an 8th grade student, I believe that both physical and online learning have their own unique benefits in the classroom setting. While physical learning allows for face-to-face interaction and hands-on activities, online learning provides flexibility and accessibility. In this essay, I will analyze the pros and cons of distance learning versus traditional classroom learning, discuss potential difficulties faced with online or video conferencing, and invite students to share their personal experiences and views on distance learning. Additionally, I will consider ways in which students can become more focused and productive within distance learning.

Firstly, physical learning provides students with the opportunity to interact with their peers and teachers in person. This allows for face-to-face communication, which can help students build relationships and clarify any misunderstandings. Additionally, physical learning often involves hands-on activities, such as experiments or group projects, which can provide a more immersive and engaging learning experience. However, physical learning can also be limiting, as it is often limited to a specific time and place, and may not be accessible to all students.

On the other hand, online learning provides students with flexibility and accessibility. With online learning, students can access course materials and participate in lectures from anywhere with an internet connection. This can be particularly beneficial for students who may have difficulty attending traditional classroom sessions due to scheduling conflicts or transportation issues. Additionally, online learning often allows for more personalized learning, as students can work at their own pace and receive individualized feedback from their teachers. However, online learning can also be isolating, as students may miss out on the social interaction and support that comes with traditional classroom learning.

One potential difficulty faced with online or video conferencing is technical issues. These issues can include slow internet connections, software glitches, or hardware failures, which can disrupt the learning experience. To address this issue, students and teachers should be prepared with backup plans, such as alternative methods of communication or access to course materials. Additionally, students should be taught how to troubleshoot common technical issues, such as resetting their routers or restarting their computers.

In conclusion, both physical and online learning have their own unique benefits in the classroom setting. While physical learning allows for face-to-face interaction and hands-on activities, online learning provides flexibility and accessibility. To make the most of distance learning, students and teachers should be prepared for potential technical issues and work together",1,0.99383354,1,True

First of all, homework clubs take away from family time. Like, what's the point of having a family if we can't spend time together? It's not fair to have to choose between doing homework and seeing our parents or siblings. And let's be real, who wants to do homework on a Friday night anyway? Not me, that's for sure.

And don't even get me started on how it affects sports. I mean, I love playing basketball, but if I have to go to homework club after practice, I'll never be able to make it to the game. It's just not fair to have to choose between sports and schoolwork. It's like, can't we just have both?

And what about gaming? Like, I know some people who are really into gaming and they spend hours and hours playing. But if they have to go to homework club, they'll never be able to play as much as they want to. It's just not right.

8ee42515,"Limiting car usage has many advantages for both individuals and the environment. As highlighted in the passage set, reducing car dependency can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, decrease traffic congestion, and improve air quality. Additionally, limiting car usage promotes healthier and more sustainable modes of transportation such as walking, biking, and public transit.

One of the key advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passage set, passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions in both Europe and the United States. By reducing car usage, individuals can contribute to lowering these emissions and combating climate change. This is particularly important given the ambitious goals to curb emissions put forth by President Obama.

In addition to reducing emissions, limiting car usage can also help alleviate traffic congestion. The passage set mentions that automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, which often leads to congested roads. By adopting a ""smart planning"" approach, as seen in the German suburb of Vauban, where car ownership is limited and public transportation is made more accessible, we can create more compact and efficient communities. This can help ease traffic congestion and make commuting easier and more efficient for everyone.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to improved air quality. The passage set highlights how smog became a major issue in cities like Paris and Bogota when car usage was not regulated. By implementing measures such as car-free days or partial driving bans, cities can significantly reduce air pollution and improve the health and well-being of their citizens.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of healthier and more sustainable modes of transportation. Encouraging walking, biking, and the use of public transit not only reduces carbon emissions but also promotes physical activity and better health. As mentioned in the passage set, the development of bike paths and the availability of public transportation can make these modes of transport more attractive and accessible to people.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for individuals and the environment. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions and traffic congestion to improving air quality and promoting healthier modes of transportation, the benefits are significant. As we continue to see a shift in behavior and a decrease in car dependency, it is important to embrace smart planning and invest in the development of sustainable communities that prioritize alternative forms of transportation.

falcon_180b_v1_372,"Today, cell phones have become a necessity for many people worldwide. With this increased use of cell phones, there is a need to consider whether or not drivers should be allowed to use their mobile phones in any capacity while driving. In my opinion, drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

Firstly, using cell phones while driving is a major distraction. It diverts the driver's attention from the road, which could lead to accidents. A driver who is texting, making calls, or scrolling through social media is not focused on the road, which could result in dangerous driving. This distraction could result in accidents that could cause injuries or deaths.

Secondly, cell phone usage while driving reduces the driver's reaction time. A driver who is on the phone may not react quickly to a sudden change in traffic or road conditions. This delay in reaction time could result in an accident that could have been avoided if the driver was not using the cell phone.

Lastly, using cell phones while driving is illegal in many countries. It is considered a dangerous act that could result in heavy fines or imprisonment. The law has been put in place to protect all road users from the dangers of using cell phones while driving.

In conclusion, drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

C70AEFA3CD16,"In a world filled with expectations, it can be difficult to remain true to oneself. The struggles of being yourself can often be compounded for immigrant populations, teenagers, and those who are considered ‘different’. For example, immigrant families often have to deal with different cultures, expectations, and norms, which can make it hard for them to stay true to their identity and beliefs. Teenagers, in particular, frequently have to face peer pressure to conform to certain standards and ideals, which again can make it difficult to be their authentic selves. And those who are seen as ‘different’ – whether because of their personal preferences, physical appearance, or anything else – often have to battle against negative stereotypes in order to remain true to themselves.

Despite these difficulties, however, it is possible to be yourself, even in difficult situations. For example, it can be beneficial to surround oneself with people who can support, encourage and motivate you to be your true self, free from judgement. It can also be beneficial to identify and nurture your passions and engage in meaningful activities. Through these means, it is possible to stick to your values and be your true self in spite of any pressure to conform. 

Indeed, ‘being yourself’ in less than ideal conditions can be the ‘greatest accomplishment’ of all. By remaining true to your authentic self, you can stay confident and maintain your integrity, even when facing adversity.

llama_70b_v1410,"Libraries have been a vital part of our society for centuries, serving as a hub for knowledge and learning. However, with the advent of the digital age, the role of libraries has come under scrutiny. Some argue that libraries are no longer necessary, while others believe they are more important than ever. In this essay, I will argue for the continued importance of libraries, providing reasons and examples to support my position.

Firstly, libraries provide a free and accessible source of information. With the rise of the internet, it may seem that information is readily available to everyone. However, not everyone has access to the internet or the skills to navigate it effectively. Libraries offer a space where people can access information without the need for a computer or internet connection. Additionally, libraries often have resources that are not available online, such as rare books, archives, and special collections. These resources are invaluable for researchers, students, and anyone looking to expand their knowledge.

Secondly, libraries are a vital source of community engagement. They offer a space for people to come together and learn from one another. Libraries often host events, workshops, and programs that cater to people of all ages, backgrounds, and interests. These events promote literacy, creativity, and social cohesion, fostering a sense of community and belonging. For example, my local library hosts a weekly book club, where members can discuss books and share their thoughts and opinions. This not only promotes literacy but also provides a platform for people to connect and make new friends.

Thirdly, libraries are essential for supporting education. They provide students with access to resources and materials that are often not available at school or home. Libraries also offer study spaces, quiet areas, and research assistance, all of which are critical for students looking to succeed. Furthermore, libraries often provide access to digital resources, such as online databases and e-books, which can be accessed remotely. This means that students can access information and resources from anywhere, at any time, making it easier for them to learn and succeed.

Finally, libraries are adapting to the digital age by embracing technology and innovation. Many libraries now offer e-books, audiobooks, and digital media, allowing people to access information in a format that suits them. Libraries are also using technology to improve accessibility, with tools such as text-to-speech software and screen readers. This means that people with disabilities can access information more easily, making libraries more inclusive and accessible.

In conclusion, libraries are just as important in the digital age as they have always been. They provide a free and accessible source of information, promote community engagement, support education, and are adapting to technology and innovation. While some may argue that libraries are no longer necessary, the evidence suggests that they are more important than ever.

A1CA2A691C98,"Hey, it's me, your average 8th grade student!  Today, we're gonna talk about this cool guy named Ralph Waldo Emerson and his thoughts on mastering something to succeed in life. He said, ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" Whoa, right?!

So, I think it's super important to master something, like a skill or a passion, to be successful. When you're really good at something, it shows that you're dedicated and hardworking, and it can open up so many doors for you. Like, if you're really good at playing the guitar, you could start a band and make a living off of it! Or if you're great at drawing, you could get a job as an artist. See what I mean?

But here's the thing – it's not just about mastering something, it's also about following your dreams and not letting anyone else tell you what to do. Like, if you really want to be a doctor but your parents want you to be a lawyer, you should totally go for it! It's your life, and you should do what makes you happy. And don't even get me started on how following your dreams can lead to success. Like, think about all the super successful people who did things their own way – Steve Jobs, Oprah, Leonardo DiCaprio – they all took risks and pursued their passions, and look where it got them!

Now, I know some people might say that mastering something is too hard, or that you'll never be good enough. But let me tell you, those people are just trying to bring you down. They don't want you to succeed because it makes them feel better about themselves. But you shouldn't let them get to you! Just keep working hard and believing in yourself, and you'll get there.

falcon_180b_v1_4,"""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" is an interesting article that talks about new technology that enables computers to identify human emotions. The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a system that can read the emotions on someone's face. While this may seem like a great idea, using this technology in a classroom setting to read the emotions of students might not be as valuable as it sounds.

Firstly, using FACS in a classroom might be an invasion of privacy for some students. Some students might not feel comfortable knowing that their facial expressions are being monitored and analyzed by a machine. This could lead to feelings of discomfort, anxiety, and even anger towards the technology and the teacher who is using it.

Secondly, the accuracy of FACS in reading emotions is still being debated. While some experts believe that it can accurately identify a range of emotions, others believe that it is not always reliable. This means that there is a chance that the technology could misinterpret a student's emotions, leading to misunderstandings, and potentially causing more harm than good.

Lastly, relying on technology to identify a student's emotions may not be as effective as simply talking to them. Teachers should be able to read their student's emotional state based on their body language, tone of voice, and other nonverbal cues. These cues are often more accurate than what technology can provide.

In conclusion, using FACS in a classroom setting to read the emotions of students might not be as valuable as it sounds. It can be an invasion of privacy, its accuracy might be questionable, and teachers should focus on developing their ability to read their student's emotions. Instead, teachers could create an environment where students feel comfortable talking about their feelings and concerns, allowing them to express themselves freely.""",1,0.9907307,1,True

It would also be good for student athaletes that have to travel for thier sport. They could do thier skool work while they are away.

Another way it would be good is for student that have anxiety. Sometimes it can be hard to go to skool and be in a big group of people. With distant learning they could do thier school work from the comfort of there own home where they feel safe.

94C1C9CD10B7,"As an eighth-grade student, I have been attending school for almost ten hours a day, five days a week. However, some schools have proposed adding an extra hour and thirty minutes to the school day. While some people believe that this would be beneficial, others argue that it would be detrimental. In this essay, I will be discussing the pros and cons of a school day one hour and thirty minutes longer.

On the one hand, having a longer school day could have several advantages. Firstly, it would allow for more time for students to learn and absorb new information. With an extra hour and thirty minutes, teachers could provide more in-depth lessons and activities that would help students better understand the material. Additionally, students could have more time to work on homework and assignments, which would improve their grades and overall academic performance.

Furthermore, a longer school day could also provide more opportunities for extracurricular activities. Many students are interested in participating in sports, music, and other clubs, but they often struggle to find time to balance their academic and extracurricular responsibilities. With an extra hour and thirty minutes, students could have more time to participate in these activities and develop new skills and interests.

On the other hand, a longer school day could also have several disadvantages. Firstly, it could lead to increased stress and burnout for students. With more time in school, students would have to endure more lessons, lectures, and assignments, which could be overwhelming and exhausting. Additionally, students may struggle to maintain a healthy work-life balance, as they would have to spend more time in school and less time on other activities outside of school.

Furthermore, a longer school day could also lead to a decrease in the quality of education. With more time in school, teachers may become overwhelmed and struggle to provide effective and engaging lessons. Additionally, students may become disengaged and disinterested in learning, as they may feel that the school day is too long and uninteresting.

In conclusion, a school day one hour and thirty minutes longer could have both advantages and disadvantages.

Subject: Community Service Policy

Dear Principal Smith,

I am writing this letter to express my opinion regarding the community service policy that you are currently considering for our school. I believe that community service should be mandatory for all students because it provides numerous benefits to both the community and the students.

Firstly, community service helps to build a stronger sense of community by fostering social connections between different groups of people. For example, tutoring elementary school children can help to bridge the gap between younger and older generations, which can lead to improved communication and understanding. Additionally, cleaning up litter can help to create a cleaner and more pleasant environment for everyone in the community.

Secondly, community service also provides valuable learning experiences for students. Through community service, students can develop their leadership, teamwork, and problem-solving skills. For instance, organizing a food drive or a charity event requires planning, coordination, and teamwork. These skills are not only beneficial for future academic success but also for personal growth.

Lastly, community service can also help students to gain a better perspective on their own lives and to develop empathy towards others. By volunteering in different community settings, students can learn about the challenges and struggles that others face, which can lead to a greater appreciation for their own lives and a desire to help those in need.

While I understand that some of my friends think community service takes too much time away from other activities, I believe that the benefits far outweigh the costs. Therefore, I strongly support the idea of making community service mandatory for all students in our school.

Thank you for considering my opinion.

Sincerely,

7c3937f7,"In recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage in suburban areas. This concept, known as smart planning, aims to separate suburban life from automobile use in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create more compact and accessible communities. The advantages of limiting car usage are evident in various examples around the world, such as the German suburb of Vauban, where residents have given up their cars and enjoy a more peaceful and happy lifestyle. Additionally, the city of Paris enforced a partial driving ban to combat severe smog, resulting in reduced congestion and improved air quality. Moreover, Bogota, Colombia implemented a car-free day, which not only reduced traffic jams, but also generated a revolutionary change in transportation habits. These examples highlight the benefits of limiting car usage, including reduced emissions, improved air quality, and increased accessibility to alternative transportation options.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and improved air quality. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, while in some car-intensive areas in the United States, this number can reach up to 50 percent. By decreasing the reliance on cars in suburban areas, we can significantly reduce these emissions and contribute to the fight against climate change. Additionally, limiting car usage can help alleviate severe smog, as seen in Paris, where a partial driving ban resulted in a 60 percent reduction in congestion and improved air quality. These examples demonstrate that by limiting car usage, we can create cleaner and healthier communities.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improved accessibility to alternative transportation options. In the German suburb of Vauban, 70 percent of families do not own cars, and the community has implemented a car-free policy in most areas. This has led to the development of walkable streets, bike paths, and an efficient public transportation system. By creating communities that are more accessible to public transportation and less dependent on cars, we can reduce traffic congestion and promote sustainable and convenient travel options. This is evident in Bogota, Colombia, where millions of Colombians participated in a car-free day, leaving the streets devoid of traffic jams. This event promoted alternative transportation methods, such as hiking, biking, and taking buses, and showcased the potential for a more sustainable and efficient transportation system.

Limiting car usage also has the potential to improve quality of life for individuals. In the German suburb of Vauban, residents who have given up their cars report feeling happier and less stressed. They enjoy quieter and more peaceful streets filled with the sounds of bicycles and children playing. By reducing car dependency, individuals can experience a more connected and vibrant community, as seen in Vauban, where stores are placed within walking distance on a main street, instead of being located in distant malls along highways. This not only promotes a healthier and more active lifestyle, but also supports local businesses and fosters a sense of community.

In conclusion, limiting car usage in suburban areas has numerous advantages, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, increased accessibility to alternative transportation options, and an improved quality of life for individuals. Examples from Germany, Paris, and Bogota have shown the positive impact of limiting car usage, leading to cleaner and healthier communities, reduced congestion, and more vibrant and connected neighborhoods. As we continue to face the challenges of climate change and urbanization, limiting car usage should be considered as a smart planning approach to create sustainable and livable communities.",1,0.99291563,1,True

In this essay, I will analyze how technology has positively impacted our daily lives by examining the history of the telephone, the impact of transportation technology on our society, and the advantages of technology for studying, taking decisions, and connecting with distant family and friends.

The telephone is one of the most significant technological advancements in human history. It has transformed the way we communicate and connect with others. The first telephone was invented by Alexander Graham Bell in 1876, and since then, it has become an essential tool for communication. Today, we use phones to call, text, email, and video chat with people all over the world. The telephone has made it possible for people to stay connected with their loved ones, even when they are thousands of miles apart.

Transportation technology has also had a significant impact on our society. The invention of the wheel revolutionized transportation and made it possible for humans to move goods and people over long distances. In the 20th century, the automobile became the primary mode of transportation, and it has since transformed the way we travel. Today, we have a variety of transportation options, including cars, trains, buses, and airplanes. These advancements have made it possible for people to travel quickly and easily, allowing them to explore new places and cultures.

Technology has also had a significant impact on the way we study. With the advent of the internet, students can access a wealth of information from anywhere in the world. Online courses have become increasingly popular, allowing people to learn new skills and take classes from the comfort of their own homes. Technology has also made it possible for students to collaborate with others, regardless of their location. This has made it possible for people to work together on projects and assignments, even if they are thousands of miles apart.

Finally, technology has had a significant impact on the way we make decisions. With the internet, people can access information quickly and easily, allowing them to make informed decisions.

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. As shown in the passage set, communities around the world are experimenting with car-free or car-reduced neighborhoods to encourage alternative transportation methods, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and improve quality of life. These initiatives demonstrate that there are clear benefits to limiting car usage, including improved air quality, reduced traffic congestion, increased physical activity, and enhanced social interactions.

One of the primary advantages of limiting car usage is the positive impact it can have on the environment. Cars are a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, which are responsible for climate change. In many car-intensive areas, passenger cars are responsible for up to 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. By reducing car usage and promoting alternative transportation options such as walking, cycling, and public transit, communities can significantly reduce their carbon footprint and combat climate change.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can help alleviate traffic congestion and improve air quality. Suburbs and cities that have implemented car-free or car-reduced zones have seen a significant decrease in traffic and congestion. For example, Vauban in Germany, a car-free community, has only two places for car parking and as a result, 70 percent of families do not own cars. This has led to less crowded streets and a more peaceful and enjoyable living environment for residents. Additionally, by reducing the number of cars on the road, air pollution from vehicle exhaust is also reduced, leading to cleaner and healthier air for everyone.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of physical activity and healthier lifestyles. When cars are not the primary mode of transportation, people are more likely to walk, bike, or use public transit. These forms of transportation require physical exertion and can contribute to a more active and healthy lifestyle. Regular physical activity has numerous health benefits, including reduced risk of chronic diseases, improved mental well-being, and increased overall fitness levels.

In addition to the health benefits, limiting car usage can also lead to increased social interactions and stronger communities. When people rely less on cars and more on alternative transportation methods, such as walking or cycling, they are more likely to interact with their neighbors and communities. This can lead to a stronger sense of belonging and community engagement.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can also have economic benefits. Car ownership and maintenance can be expensive, and by reducing car usage, individuals can save money on fuel, car insurance, parking fees, and maintenance costs. This can lead to more disposable income and financial stability for individuals and families.

In conclusion, there are numerous advantages to limiting car usage. As seen in the passage set, communities that have implemented car-free or car-reduced neighborhoods have experienced benefits such as improved air quality, reduced traffic congestion, increased physical activity, and enhanced social interactions. By promoting alternative transportation methods and decreasing reliance on cars, individuals and communities can contribute to a more sustainable and enjoyable living environment for all.",1,0.9938035,1,True

8. Discuss the benefits of playing the violin and how it has impacted your life.

The violin is a beautiful and versatile musical instrument that has a rich history and background. It is believed to have originated in the 15th century in Italy, where it was used in both religious and secular settings. The violin quickly gained popularity and was later adopted by various European countries, including France and Germany. Today, it is played by millions of people around the world and is considered one of the most popular musical instruments.

As an 8th-grade student, I can reflect back on my childhood memories and explain how I gained an interest in the violin. I was always fascinated by music and enjoyed listening to various genres, including classical, jazz, and pop. One day, I watched a performance by a violinist at a local concert, and I was immediately captivated by the sound of the instrument. I knew that I wanted to learn how to play the violin and began taking lessons shortly after.

To become proficient in the violin, I needed to develop several skills, including proper posture, finger technique, and intonation. It took a lot of practice and dedication to master these skills, but with the guidance of my violin teacher, I was able to make progress over time. I also had to learn how to read sheet music and understand the different parts of the violin, such as the neck, body, and strings.

My first experiences taking violin lessons were both exciting and challenging. I was eager to learn, but also felt a bit nervous and unsure of what to expect. My teacher was patient and encouraging, and helped me to build a strong foundation of skills. We started with the basics, such as holding the instrument properly and learning how to produce sound. As I progressed, we moved on to more advanced techniques, such as playing scales and arpeggios.

Not practicing the violin regularly can have detrimental consequences. Without regular practice, the muscles used to play the instrument can become weak and stiff, making it difficult to produce a clear and expressive sound.

E7DB2DC8B151,"As an 8th grade student, I have been researching the issue of curfews for teenagers and have found some interesting points to consider. Curfews are rules that restrict teenagers from being out after a certain time, usually set by parents or guardians. The main purpose of curfews is to ensure teens are safe and secure, especially during late hours when criminal activities may occur.

One of the potential benefits of curfews is that they can help protect teens from harmful situations. For instance, curfews can prevent teens from being involved in accidents or violent crimes that may occur late at night. Additionally, curfews can help teens develop a sense of responsibility and accountability, as they learn to manage their time and follow rules set by their parents or guardians.

However, there are also risks and drawbacks associated with curfews. For example, curfews can limit teens' freedom and independence, as they may not be able to go out with friends or engage in activities they enjoy. Curfews can also create a sense of mistrust between teens and their parents or guardians, leading to conflicts and misunderstandings.

In terms of safety, curfews may not always be effective in preventing accidents or crimes. Teens may find ways to circumvent the curfew rules, such as sneaking out or lying to their parents. Moreover, curfews may not take into account the individual needs and circumstances of each teen, leading to an unfair or unrealistic restriction.

When it comes to time management, curfews can be challenging for teens who have after-school activities or jobs. Teens may feel rushed or stressed as they try to fit in all their responsibilities before the curfew time. This can lead to poor time management and academic performance.

Finally, curfews can have a negative impact on a teen's academic success. Late nights or missed curfews can result in missed school days or poor attendance, which can affect a teen's academic performance.

This topic is highly debatable, and people have different views on it. However, based on what I have learned so far, I believe that we need stricter gun control laws.

The first reason why we need stricter gun control laws is to reduce the number of deaths caused by guns. Every year, thousands of people lose their lives due to gun-related incidents. If we have more control over who can own a gun and how it can be used, we can significantly decrease these numbers. For example, in countries where guns are strictly regulated, like Japan or the United Kingdom, there are fewer deaths caused by guns.

Secondly, stricter gun control laws can help prevent school shootings. In recent times, we have seen many tragic incidents where innocent students and teachers have lost their lives due to gun violence at schools. If we have stricter laws in place, it will be harder for people to get their hands on guns, including those who intend to harm others with them. This will make our schools safer places for everyone.

Lastly, stricter gun control laws can help reduce crime rates. When it is harder for criminals to obtain guns, they will be less likely to commit crimes using them. This is especially true for serious crimes like murder and armed robbery. Therefore, having stricter gun control laws will not only reduce gun-related deaths but also other violent crimes.

In conclusion, I think that we need to have stricter gun control laws in our society. By doing so, we can save many lives, prevent school shootings, and reduce crime rates. It is time for our leaders to take action and make our world a safer place.",1,0.9928813,1,True

I believe that it is not in the best interest of the students to force them to participate in extracurricular activities. While extracurricular activities can be beneficial for students, there are also many reasons why some students may not be able to participate or may not want to participate.

Firstly, extracurricular activities can be time-consuming and require a significant amount of commitment. Not all students have the same amount of free time or the same level of interest in these activities. Some students may have family obligations or other responsibilities that prevent them from participating, while others may simply not have the time or energy to commit to an extracurricular activity. Forcing all students to participate in these activities can create a situation where some students feel overwhelmed and stressed, while others feel like they are being punished for not being able to participate.

Secondly, extracurricular activities can be expensive. Many extracurricular activities require students to pay a fee or purchase equipment, which can be a financial burden for some families. Forcing all students to participate in these activities can create a situation where some students are unable to participate due to financial constraints, while others are able to participate because their families have the financial means to do so. This can create a situation where some students feel like they are being punished for not being able to participate, while others feel like they are being rewarded for being able to participate.

Finally, extracurricular activities can be stressful and overwhelming for some students.

It can help us to overcome challenges, reduce stress, and increase our overall happiness. Additionally, a good attitude can improve our relationships by making us more approachable, empathetic, and understanding. It can also help us to build stronger connections with others and create a more positive and supportive environment.

Secondly, having a good attitude can help us to learn more effectively. When we have a positive attitude towards learning, we are more motivated to engage in the process and are more likely to retain the information we learn. This can lead to better academic performance, increased creativity, and a greater sense of accomplishment. Furthermore, a good attitude towards learning can help us to develop critical thinking skills, problem-solving abilities, and a growth mindset, which are essential for success in any field.

Lastly, having a good attitude can give us better results than having a bad attitude. When we approach tasks with a positive attitude, we are more likely to be persistent, focused, and productive.

So, Einstein thinks that knowledge is more important than imagination. He thinks that knowledge is what helps us understand the world and make new discoveries, and that imagination is just something that we use to make up stories and stuff. But I don't totally agree with him.

I think that imagination is pretty darn important too! Like, without imagination, we wouldn't have all the cool technologies and stuff that we have today. Think about it, like, if someone didn't imagine what a smartphone would be like, we wouldn't have them! And they're like, super useful and stuff.

But on the other hand, knowledge is pretty cool too. Like, without knowledge, we wouldn't know how to use all the cool technologies that we have. And it's not just that, knowledge helps us understand the world and how it works, and that's pretty cool too.

So, I think that both imagination and knowledge are important in their own ways. Like, they're both super valuable and stuff. Imagination helps us come up with new ideas and make new things, but knowledge helps us understand how to use those things and make them real.

For example, like, if you're trying to invent a new type of car, you need to use your imagination to come up with the idea of what it would look like and how it would work. But then you need to use your knowledge to figure out how to make it real and stuff.

And another example is like, if you're trying to understand a new topic in school, you need to use your knowledge to learn about it and understand it. But then you can use your imagination to think of new ways to use that knowledge and make it useful.

So yeah, I think that imagination and knowledge are both important, and they work together to make us smarter and more creative and stuff. And that's pretty cool!",1,0.99428844,1,True
c494a31c,"Limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can greatly benefit society. By reducing our reliance on cars, we can combat the issue of greenhouse gas emissions, create more compact and accessible communities, and improve the overall quality of life.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the positive impact it can have on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passage set, passenger cars are responsible for a significant proportion of greenhouse gas emissions in both Europe and the United States. By limiting the number of cars on the roads, we can effectively decrease these emissions and mitigate the detrimental effects of climate change. This is especially important considering the increasing number of private cars owned by the middle class in developing countries, which are contributing to the pollution of cities.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to the creation of more compact and accessible communities. The passages explain how new approaches to suburban planning, such as in the German suburb of Vauban, involve placing stores within walking distance rather than on distant highways. This not only encourages residents to rely less on cars, but also promotes healthier and more sustainable living. Additionally, these developments often prioritize public transportation and have limited parking spaces, making it more convenient for people to use alternative modes of transportation.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement in the overall quality of life for individuals. The passage describes how residents of Vauban, Germany, who have given up their cars, report feeling happier and less stressed. This is because relying on cars can be a source of tension and anxiety, whereas other modes of transportation, such as biking or walking, can be more enjoyable and relaxing. Additionally, reducing car usage can lead to less congestion on roads, resulting in faster and more efficient travel for everyone.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can have significant advantages for society. It can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, create more compact and accessible communities, and improve the overall well-being of individuals. By implementing smart planning strategies, such as those seen in Vauban, Germany, and promoting alternative modes of transportation, we can work towards a future with less reliance on cars and a more sustainable and livable environment.",1,0.9933975,1,True
DED3BCBE5049,"After School Homework Club: A Pros and Cons Analysis

As an eighth-grade student, I believe that an after school homework club would be a valuable addition to our school. However, I also understand that there are potential downsides to implementing such a program. In this essay, I will discuss the benefits of an after school homework club, as well as the potential downsides, and compare it to completing homework at home.

One of the main benefits of an after school homework club is the opportunity for students to work together and collaborate on their assignments. By working in a group, students can share ideas, ask questions, and help each other understand the material. This can be particularly beneficial for students who struggle with certain concepts or who are new to the subject matter. Additionally, working in a group can help students develop important social skills, such as communication and teamwork.

Another benefit of an after school homework club is the potential for increased productivity. By having a dedicated time and place to work on homework, students may be more motivated to complete their assignments and may be able to focus better. This could lead to higher grades and a better overall academic performance.

However, there are also potential downsides to implementing an after school homework club. One of the main concerns is the potential for over-reliance on the club. If students become too dependent on the club for help with their homework, they may not be developing the necessary skills to complete their assignments on their own. Additionally, the club may not be able to accommodate all students, particularly those with special needs or those who have other after school activities.

Another potential downside is the potential for increased stress and pressure on students. If students feel like they need to attend the club every day in order to keep up with their homework, they may become overwhelmed and stressed. This could lead to decreased mental health and overall well-being.

When comparing an after school homework club to completing homework at home, there are several factors to consider. One of the main benefits of completing homework at home is the flexibility and convenience. Students can work on their assignments at their own pace and in their own time, which can be particularly beneficial for those with busy schedules or other responsibilities. Additionally, completing homework at home can provide a more personalized and individualized learning experience, as students can tailor their study habits to their own needs and preferences.",1,0.99371743,1,True
7007EB8E265D,"Working alone or with a group is a common debate among individuals, especially in the workplace. Both methods have their own set of benefits, but which one is better? In this essay, I will compare the benefits of working alone versus working with a group.

Working alone has its own set of benefits. For one, it allows individuals to have more control over their work environment and schedule. They can work at their own pace and focus on their own tasks without interruption. This can lead to increased productivity and efficiency. Additionally, working alone can provide a sense of independence and autonomy, which can be motivating for some individuals.

However, working alone also has its drawbacks. For one, it can be isolating and lonely. Without the support and collaboration of others, individuals may struggle with problem-solving and decision-making. Additionally, working alone can lead to a lack of diversity in ideas and perspectives, which can limit innovation and creativity.

On the other hand, working with a group has its own set of benefits. For one, it provides individuals with the opportunity to collaborate and share ideas with others. This can lead to increased creativity and innovation, as well as a sense of community and support. Additionally, working with a group can provide a sense of accountability and motivation, as individuals are working towards a common goal.

However, working with a group also has its drawbacks. For one, it can be difficult to manage conflicts and differing opinions. Additionally, working with a group can be time-consuming, as individuals may need to spend time discussing and agreeing on decisions.

In conclusion, both working alone and working with a group have their own set of benefits and drawbacks. Ultimately, the choice of which method to use depends on the individual and the task at hand. Working alone may be beneficial for tasks that require a high level of focus and independence, while working with a group may be beneficial for tasks that require collaboration and creativity.

In order to make an informed decision, it is important to consider the specific needs and goals of the task at hand, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of the individual. By weighing the pros and cons of each method, individuals can make an informed decision that will lead to the most successful outcome.",1,0.9942808,1,True
E28221F47AE3,"As an eighth-grade student, it is common for individuals to begin thinking about their future careers. While making a decision at a young age may seem beneficial, there are also drawbacks to consider. In this essay, we will analyze the benefits and drawbacks of deciding on a career at a young age, including job availability, economic stability, parental ability to cover costs, and the potential impact on mental health and personal growth.

One benefit of deciding on a career at a young age is that it allows individuals to have a clear direction in life. Knowing what they want to do early on can help them focus their education and work towards their goals. Additionally, it can provide a sense of purpose and motivation to work hard in school and pursue opportunities that align with their chosen field. This can lead to a greater sense of satisfaction and fulfillment in life.

However, there are also drawbacks to consider. One major drawback is that job availability may not always be guaranteed. The job market is constantly changing, and certain careers may become obsolete or have limited opportunities. Additionally, economic stability can be a concern, as some careers may have higher salaries or job security than others. It is important for individuals to consider these factors and have a backup plan in case their chosen career does not pan out as expected.

Another potential drawback of deciding on a career at a young age is the impact on parental ability to cover costs. College tuition and other expenses can be significant, and it is important for parents to be able to support their children's education and career goals. If an individual chooses a career that requires a lot of education or has a low starting salary, it may put a strain on their parents' finances. It is important for individuals to consider the financial impact of their career choices and make sure they are feasible for their families.

Finally, there are potential impacts on mental health and personal growth to consider. Choosing a career too early can lead to feelings of pressure and anxiety, as individuals may feel like they have to make a decision that will define their entire lives. Additionally, if an individual chooses a career that they are not passionate about, it can lead to feelings of dissatisfaction and a lack of purpose in life. It is important for individuals to take the time to explore their interests and passions before making a decision about their career.

When it comes to playing a musical instrument, challenging oneself can lead to significant improvements in both technical and creative skills. For example, learning a new song or technique can be challenging, but the effort put into mastering it can lead to a sense of accomplishment and pride. Furthermore, playing a musical instrument can also help individuals develop discipline, patience, and perseverance, which are valuable skills in all aspects of life.

Learning disabilities can also benefit from challenging oneself. For instance, individuals with dyslexia can benefit from learning new techniques and tools to improve their reading and writing skills. This can lead to increased confidence and a sense of achievement. Moreover, challenging oneself can also help individuals with learning disabilities develop a growth mindset, which can lead to a more positive outlook on life and a willingness to take on new challenges.

In school education, challenging oneself can lead to improved academic performance and a deeper understanding of the subject matter. For example, taking advanced courses or participating in extracurricular activities can push students beyond their comfort zones and help them develop new skills and knowledge. Additionally, challenging oneself can also help students develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills, which are essential for success in the future.

In conclusion, challenging oneself is crucial for personal growth and development. Whether it's playing a musical instrument, learning disabilities, or school education, pushing oneself beyond one's limits can lead to significant improvements in skills, confidence, and a growth mindset.

Second, people use it for medicine. My grandma has really bad arthritis and she takes it to help her joints not hurt as much. It helps her sleep too. My mom's friend has cancer and she uses it to help her feel better too. It's not fair that people can't use something that helps them just because it's illegal.

Third, it's not as bad as other drugs. My older brother does drugs and he says that marijuana is the least bad one. He says it doesn't make you do crazy things like other drugs do. It just makes you feel happy and relaxed.

Fourth, it would help the economy. If it was legal, the government could tax it and use the money for important things like schools and hospitals. They could also use the money to help people who are addicted to drugs.

Finally, it's not fair to put people in jail for something that's not hurting anyone. My friend's dad got arrested for having a little bit of marijuana and he had to go to court. It was a big hassle and it's not fair that he could have gone to jail for something that's not even bad for you.

I know some people might say that it's a gateway drug, but that's not true. My brother started doing drugs because his friends were doing them, not because he smoked marijuana. It's not the marijuana's fault, it's the person's fault.

A1DC92E4E3C8,"As an 8th grader, I have to say that technology has been a game changer in our society. While some people might think that too much technology can be a bad thing, I believe that the positive effects of limited human contact due to technology in the United States far outweigh the negative ones.

First of all, technology has made life so much easier for our elderly population. With things like smart homes, grocery delivery, and ride-sharing services, they don't have to exert themselves as much as they used to. This has led to a significant increase in their overall health and well-being. For example, a study by the University of California found that older adults who used technology to manage their health had better physical and mental health outcomes compared to those who didn't.

Secondly, technology has provided a safe space for people to discuss politics and other sensitive topics without fear of judgment or retribution. With social media platforms and online forums, people can express their opinions and engage in meaningful discussions without having to worry about being ostracized or bullied. This has been particularly important in recent times, when political polarization has led to a lot of division and conflict.

Thirdly, technology has opened up new opportunities for students like me who might not be the best at academics. With online resources and educational websites, we can learn at our own pace and in a way that suits our learning style. This has been a game changer for kids like me who might struggle in a traditional classroom setting.

Finally, technology has helped foster connection amongst people in ways that were previously unimaginable. With social media, messaging apps, and video conferencing, people can connect with each other from all over the world. This has led to a more interconnected and global community, where people can share ideas and collaborate on projects in ways that were previously impossible.

In conclusion, technology has been incredibly successful in saving lives, creating a more equal learning environment, and contributing to society's well-being. While it's true that too much technology can be a bad thing, the benefits of limited human contact due to technology far outweigh the drawbacks.

falcon_180b_v1_108,"I personally believe that zoos should continue to operate because they play an important role in conservation and education. Zoos provide a safe haven for endangered species, where they can live and breed without fear of habitat destruction or poaching. In the wild, these animals may not survive due to various threats, but in captivity, they have a better chance of survival.

Zoos also serve as a platform for educating people about different species of animals and their importance in our ecosystem. They offer educational programs and tours that help visitors understand the behavior, habitat, and needs of various animals. This knowledge helps create awareness and encourages people to take action towards protecting these species and their habitats.

Moreover, many zoos conduct research on animal behavior, physiology, and genetics. This research contributes to our understanding of these animals and helps us develop better strategies for their conservation. For example, the research conducted on giant pandas in captivity led to the development of successful breeding programs, which have increased the population of this endangered species.

While there are some concerns about the welfare of animals in zoos, most modern zoos prioritize the well-being of their animals. They provide them with large enclosures, nutritious food, and medical care when needed. Additionally, many zoos participate in breeding programs aimed at reintroducing endangered species into the wild.

In conclusion, zoos play a crucial role in conservation and education. They provide a safe haven for endangered species, educate people about the importance of wildlife conservation, and contribute to research that helps protect these species. While improvements can always bemade to ensure the best care for animals in zoos, I believe that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks, and zoos should continue to operate.",1,0.9905537,1,True

First of all, when you're doing poorly in school, you're not gonna be able to focus on anything else, like, at all. And if you're out there playing sports or joining clubs and stuff, you're gonna be like, totally distracted and not pay attention to your schoolwork. And that's just, like, not cool.

They're like, super boring and you're gonna be surrounded by people who are, like, way behind you. It's gonna be so embarrassing.

Dear [Senator’s name],

My name is [Your name], and I am a seventh-grade student at [Name of school] in [City, State]. I am writing to express my opinion on the Electoral College and the popular vote for the President of the United States. I believe that the Electoral College should be kept, as it is a fair and effective way of selecting the President.

The Electoral College ensures that the President is elected by the whole country, not just certain regions or states with the highest population. This helps to balance the power between the different states and gives every state a voice in the election. The popular vote, on the other hand, would result in the President being elected by the most populous states, which would lead to a bias in favor of those states.

According to the article “The Electoral College: How it Works in Contemporary Presidential Elections” by the Congressional Research Service, the Electoral College is a compromise between the election of the President by Congress and by popular vote. It was designed to balance the interests of large and small states and to ensure that the President would have broad support across the country.

Moreover, the Electoral College helps to prevent the election of a President by a narrow majority, which could lead to instability in the government. This is because the President would not have a strong mandate to govern if he or she were elected by a small margin of the vote. The Electoral College ensures that the President is elected by a majority of electoral votes, which gives him or her a stronger mandate.

In conclusion, I believe that the Electoral College should be kept, as it is a fair and effective way of selecting the President. It helps to balance the power between the different states and ensures that the President is elected by the whole country, not just certain regions or states. I hope that you will take my opinion into consideration when making decisions about the future of the Electoral College.

He served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom during World War II, leading the country to victory against Nazi Germany. Churchill was known for his leadership, wit, and determination, which helped him overcome many obstacles throughout his life.

Churchill's quote ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"" highlights his belief in perseverance and resilience. He believed that success is not about avoiding failure, but rather learning from it and continuing to push forward with determination. This quote is particularly relevant to my own life, as I have faced many challenges and setbacks, but I have learned to keep a positive attitude and keep working towards my goals.

One personal experience where I had to overcome obstacles to reach success was when I was struggling in math class. I found it difficult to understand the concepts and was getting poor grades. However, I didn't give up, I worked hard, sought help from my teacher and tutor, and practiced regularly. Through persistence and determination, I was able to improve my grades and eventually succeed in the class.

There are several strategies that can help achieve success, including working hard, keeping a positive attitude, solving problems, trying your best, and learning something new. Working hard involves putting in the effort and time necessary to achieve your goals. Keeping a positive attitude means staying motivated and optimistic, even in the face of challenges. Solving problems involves finding creative solutions to overcome obstacles. Trying your best means giving your all and striving for excellence. Finally, learning something new means continuing to expand your knowledge and skills, which can help you adapt to new situations and achieve success in different areas of life.

In conclusion, Winston Churchill's life and quote provide valuable insights into the nature of success.

F29244150DCB,"Online classes, also known as cyber school or virtual school, have become a popular option for high school students in recent years. While some students thrive in this environment, others struggle to find the same level of engagement and academic rigor as traditional brick-and-mortar schools. In this essay, I will explore whether online classes offer an appropriate educational experience for high school students.

On the one hand, online classes offer several benefits for high school students. For example, students can take classes from the comfort of their own homes, which can be especially helpful for those who have busy schedules or who live far away from their school. This flexibility can also be beneficial for students who have difficulty with traditional school schedules due to health issues or other personal circumstances. Additionally, online classes can provide students with access to a wider range of courses and resources than what may be available at their traditional school.

On the other hand, there are several drawbacks to online classes. For instance, students may struggle with the lack of face-to-face interaction with their teachers and peers. This can make it more difficult for students to build relationships and get the support they need to succeed academically. Additionally, online classes may not provide the same level of structure and accountability as traditional school, which can lead to students falling behind or not completing their work.

In my opinion, online classes can be a good option for some high school students, but they are not appropriate for everyone. Students who are self-motivated and disciplined, and who have a good support system at home, may find online classes to be a good fit. However, students who struggle with organization and time management, or who rely heavily on face-to-face interaction with their teachers and peers, may find online classes to be less effective.

In conclusion, while online classes can offer some benefits for high school students, they are not a one-size-fits-all solution. Students and parents should carefully consider the pros and cons of online classes before making a decision. Ultimately, the most important thing is for students to find an educational environment that works best for them and allows them to reach their full potential.",1,0.99354124,1,True

While some argue that this practice can improve communication between parents and teachers, and help parents keep track of their children's progress, I believe that it has several drawbacks.

Firstly, allowing parents to monitor their children's grades and attendance online can lead to helicopter parenting, which is a term used to describe parents who are overly involved in their children's lives, to the point where they are hindering their children's development. By constantly checking their child's grades and attendance, parents may inadvertently create a culture of anxiety and stress for their child, who may feel that they are constantly under surveillance.

Additionally, the practice of allowing parents to monitor their children's grades and attendance online can be time consuming for teachers, who may need to spend extra time uploading grades and attendance records to a system that is accessible to parents. This takes away from the time that teachers can spend on lesson planning, grading assignments, and engaging with their students.

Furthermore, there are privacy concerns associated with the practice of allowing parents to monitor their children's grades and attendance online. While parents may be able to access the grades and attendance records of their child, other students' privacy may be compromised if their grades and attendance records are accessible to parents who are not their own.

In conclusion, I believe that allowing parents to monitor their children's grades and attendance online has several drawbacks, including the potential for helicopter parenting, the burden it places on teachers, and the privacy concerns it raises. Rather than allowing parents to access grades and attendance records online, schools should focus on fostering open communication between parents and teachers, and providing parents with regular progress reports that summarize their child's academic performance. This would ensure that parents are informed about their child's progress without creating a culture of anxiety, and would respect the privacy of all students within the school.",1,0.99401605,1,True

First of all, different people have different perspectives. Like, my best friend is really into fashion, so if I'm trying to decide what to wear to a party, she's gonna give me some stylish advice. But my mom, she's more practical, so she'll be like, ""Make sure you're comfortable and don't look ridiculous."" If I only asked one of them, I might not get the full picture. But by asking both, I can see what's important to both style and comfort.

Another reason seeking multiple opinions is helpful is that people can have different areas of expertise. My history teacher, Mr. Johnson, is super smart about politics and stuff like that. So if I'm trying to decide who to vote for in an election, he's gonna give me some insight that maybe my friends wouldn't have. And my friends, they might have different opinions based on their own experiences. Like, my friend Alex is really into environmental issues, so he's gonna care about which candidate is gonna save the planet. By talking to both Mr. Johnson and my friends, I can make a more informed decision.

Lastly, seeking multiple opinions can help you avoid biases. Like, if I only ask my friends, they might all have the same opinion because they're all friends with each other. But if I talk to people who don't know each other, they might have different perspectives that I wouldn't have thought of. It's like, if I'm trying to decide if I should get a dog, my friends might all be like, ""Yeah, get a dog! They're so cute!"" But my neighbor, Mr. Smith, might be like, ""Uh, dogs are a lot of work. Are you sure you're ready for that?"" Hearing both sides can help me make a more balanced decision.

In conclusion, seeking multiple opinions can really help you make a better choice. It's like, the more perspectives you get, the more information you have to work with.

Firstly, renewable energy is better for the environment. When we use fossil fuels, like coal or oil, we release lots of carbon dioxide and other pollutants into the air. This causes climate change and pollution. Renewable energy sources, like solar or wind power, do not release any pollutants into the air. This means that they are cleaner and better for the environment.

Secondly, renewable energy is becoming more affordable. In the past, renewable energy sources like solar and wind power were very expensive. This meant that they were not a viable option for most people. However, in recent years, the cost of renewable energy has gone down. This means that it is becoming more affordable for everyone.

Thirdly, renewable energy can create jobs. When we transition to renewable energy sources, we will need to build new infrastructure and install new equipment. This means that there will be lots of new jobs available in the renewable energy sector.

Finally, if we do not transition to renewable energy sources, we will run out of fossil fuels eventually. Fossil fuels are a finite resource, which means that they will not last forever. If we do not start using renewable energy sources soon, we will have a major energy crisis in the future.

I chose to learn a new programming language that I had never used before, and the sense of accomplishment I felt when I completed it was immense. Not only had I acquired a new skill, I had also developed the confidence to keep pushing myself and discovering difficult concepts.

8EF3D97E2310,"Having a positive attitude is essential for achieving success in life. Our outlook on life can have a profound effect on the environment and opportunities around us. Positive attitudes create an attitude of hope, possibility, and resilience, even when faced with challenges. It can also inspire those around us and can bring out the best in them.

Successful people understand the importance of having a positive attitude and use it to their advantage. For example, Oprah Winfrey has famously said, ""The biggest adventure you can take is to live the life of your dreams."" This positive way of thinking has been instrumental in Oprah's success. She used her positive attitude to help people with her own TV show, through her magazine and as founder of the Oprah Winfrey Network. 

Another example of a successful person with a positive attitude is entrepreneur Richard Branson. Despite numerous setbacks, Branson has persevered and achieved success with his innovative approach. His company, Virgin, is now one of the most successful in the world. Branson's attitude of seeing opportunity instead of failure, has been instrumental in this success. 

It is clear that having a positive attitude is essential for achieving success. Positive attitudes create a hopeful and active approach to overcoming obstacles, which in turn opens up more potential opportunities for success. Successful people exemplify this attitude and have overcome great challenges to achieve their goals.",1,0.99347997,1,True
9528CA8FFC22,"In 1940, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill famously declared, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts."" This statement, a rallying cry for determination in the face of difficulty, has been held as an essential tenet of success. The idea of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm has strong advantages - being resilient and passionate in the face of struggle can help an individual persist and ultimately achieve success. 

Conversely, going from failure to failure with a loss of enthusiasm can be extremely detrimental. When faced with failure, a discouraged attitude can lead an individual to become apathetic, and even worse, to give up altogether. It is important to recognize the distinction between both approaches to success, and opt for the former whenever possible.

Throughout history, many figures have illustrated the power of Churchill's words. For example, inventor Thomas Edison famously failed thousands of times before discovering the first working incandescent lightbulb. His refusal to let failure stand in his way highlights the importance of sustaining enthusiasm and resilience in the pursuit of success. African American Civil Rights leader Rosa Parks showed similar determination when she took a stand against segregation on a Montgomery bus in 1955. 

In the face of failure and difficulty, it is paramount to draw motivation from the idea of perseverance and never giving up - Churchill's words embody this notion. The importance of maintaining a positive attitude despite challenges cannot be understated; it has the potential to take a person from failure to success.",1,0.99361295,1,True
llama_70b_v1556,"Social media has become an integral part of our daily lives, and its impact on society has been a topic of much debate. While some argue that social media has a significant impact on societal norms and values, others believe that its influence is overstated. In my opinion, social media does indeed have a significant impact on societal norms and values, and I will provide reasons and examples to support my position.

Firstly, social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook have created a virtual world where people can curate their lives and present themselves to others in a way that they want to be seen. This has led to the creation of unrealistic beauty standards, where people feel pressured to conform to certain beauty ideals. For example, the proliferation of photo editing apps and filters has made it easier for people to alter their appearance, leading to a rise in body dysmorphic disorder and low self-esteem among young people. This is particularly concerning, as it can lead to negative body image, self-harm, and even suicide.

Secondly, social media has also had a significant impact on the way we communicate and interact with each other. The rise of instant messaging and social media platforms has led to a decline in face-to-face communication, with people preferring to communicate through screens rather than in person. This can lead to a sense of isolation and loneliness, as people feel disconnected from the world around them. Furthermore, social media has also made it easier for people to bully and harass others anonymously, leading to a rise in cyberbullying and online harassment.

However, it's also important to acknowledge that social media has had some positive impacts on society. For example, it has made it easier for people to connect with others who share similar interests and passions, creating online communities that transcend geographical boundaries. Social media has also been a powerful tool for social movements, allowing people to mobilize and raise awareness about important issues like climate change, racial justice, and gender equality.

In conclusion, while social media has had some positive impacts on society, its negative impacts on societal norms and values cannot be ignored. It's important for individuals and society as a whole to be aware of these impacts and take steps to mitigate them. For example, social media companies can take responsibility for regulating their platforms to reduce the spread of harmful content, while individuals can take steps to limit their social media use and engage in face-to-face communication. By doing so, we can ensure that social media has a positive impact on society, rather than a negative one.",1,0.9941968,1,True

Eating healthy foods is essential for maintaining an optimal level of energy, reducing the risk of serious illness, and improving overall health. Changes to the school's lunch menu can play a major role in encouraging students to make healthier choices. 

By focusing on providing more wholesome options such as fresh fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy snacks, we can increase the number of healthy options on the menu. This shift in focus can also help de-emphasize unhealthy options such as processed snacks, sugary drinks, and unhealthy condiments.

F07EB7B6F40E,"Imagination is a powerful tool that has played a significant role in my life. It has helped me through difficult times and has given me hope when I needed it the most. I have learned to harness the power of imagination to overcome challenges and achieve success.

One of the most positive experiences I have had with imagination was when I was a child. I would spend hours reading books and imagining myself in the stories. I would become completely immersed in the world of the book, and it would transport me to a different place. This helped me to develop a love of reading and a vivid imagination.

However, imagination can also be a double-edged sword. When I was younger, I would often use my imagination to escape from reality. I would imagine myself in a different world, one where everything was perfect. While this helped me to cope with difficult situations, it also made it harder for me to face my problems head-on.

As I got older, I learned how to use my imagination in a more productive way. I started to use it to visualize my goals and imagine myself achieving them. This helped me to gain confidence in myself and my abilities. I began to believe that I could accomplish anything I set my mind to, and this gave me the motivation to work hard and achieve success.

One of the most difficult events in my life related to imagination was when I lost my ability to imagine. I had a traumatic experience that caused me to lose touch with my imagination. I struggled to find joy in anything, and I felt like my life was pointless. It was a dark time, and I didn't know how to get out of it.

But eventually, I found my way back to my imagination. I started to read again, and I began to imagine myself in new and exciting ways. I discovered that my imagination was not just a tool for escaping reality, but it was also a powerful tool for personal growth and self-discovery.

In conclusion, imagination has played a significant role in my life. It has helped me to overcome challenges and achieve success. While it can be a double-edged sword, I have learned how to use it in a more productive way. I have also learned that understanding the power of imagination can help me achieve my goals and live a fulfilling life.",1,0.99440765,1,True
70B91D253E27,"The idea of adding an additional 30 minutes to the school day has a few obvious drawbacks. For students, it means that they would have to arrive to school earlier and stay later, effectively reducing the amount of time spent outside of school. This could have a negative impact on after-school activities such as sports, music, clubs, and jobs, which could further limit opportunities for hands-on learning and socialization. On the other hand, it could also put a strain on students who already lead extremely busy lives and may not have the energy to stay in school longer each day. 

From the perspective of teachers, the increased hours could create additional challenges when it comes to maintaining lesson plans, grading assignments, and providing individual attention. In addition, it could also create a scheduling conflict for teachers who work outside of the school environment.

For parents, an extra 30 minutes in the school day could significantly increase the cost of their child's education and may even disrupt the family's daily schedule. It could also mean that they have less time with their children in the evenings, further limiting the amount of parental involvement in their child's education.

Ultimately, adding an additional 30 minutes to the school day could have a wide range of effects for students, teachers, and parents. It is important to consider each individual perspective before making a decision on this issue, especially since it could have lasting implications for everyday life and scheduling.",1,0.9935266,1,True

F591A84185A4,"As an eighth-grade student, I have always been fascinated by the work that police officers do. However, I have always wondered how their work varies in different countries and cultures. In this essay, I will explore the various work opportunities available in different countries, examine the different methods used by police in different countries, analyze the impact of teamwork on police work, and look into the safety regulations and work environment in a police station.

Firstly, police work opportunities are available in various countries around the world. In the United States, police officers work in local, state, and federal agencies. In contrast, in the United Kingdom, police officers work for the Metropolitan Police Service or other local forces. In Canada, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police is the national police force, while in Australia, the Australian Federal Police is responsible for national security. These are just a few examples of the many police forces that exist in different countries.

Secondly, the work done by police in different cultures varies significantly. In some countries, police officers focus primarily on maintaining law and order, while in others, they may have additional responsibilities such as providing emergency medical care or responding to natural disasters. For example, in Japan, police officers are trained to handle earthquakes and other natural disasters, while in India, police officers often work in community outreach programs to build trust and improve relations with the public.

Thirdly, there are various roles available in the police force. These include uniformed officers, detectives, forensic experts, and specialized units such as SWAT teams or bomb disposal units. Each role requires a different set of skills and training, and officers may specialize in a particular area based on their interests and strengths.

Fourthly, different methods are used by police in different countries to achieve their goals. For example, in the United States, officers often use undercover work and informants to gather information and make arrests. In contrast, in some European countries, officers may use more subtle methods such as surveillance and interviewing to gather evidence. Additionally, some countries have different legal systems, which can affect the methods used by police.

Fifthly, safety regulations and the work environment in a police station are crucial for the well-being of officers. Police officers may face dangerous situations on a regular basis, and it is essential that they have the necessary equipment and training to protect themselves.",1,0.9916932,1,True

For example, distance learning may not allow for face-to-face interaction, making it difficult for teachers to provide feedback and support. Distance learning can also be less engaging for students, as it can lack the competition and collaboration seen in traditional classrooms.

Studies have found that interpersonal interactions between teachers and students are important for learning. Communication, competition, and inspiration from teachers can all have a positive impact on student performance and engagement. Teachers can provide students one-on-one feedback to address areas of difficulty or confusion, as well as praise for a job well done. The presence of peers in the classroom creates an atmosphere of competition that encourages students to work harder. Finally, teachers can serve as a model of success and inspire students to reach their goals.

While online courses do offer a more flexible learning option, they cannot replicate the communication, competition, and inspiration of a traditional classroom. Interaction with peers is limited and feedback from teachers can be delayed or difficult to understand. Furthermore, there may be less motivation to succeed as there is no sense of competition.

Extracurricular activities provide numerous benefits that can positively impact a student's health, social interaction, and academic performance.

Firstly, participating in an extracurricular activity can improve a student's physical health. Many extracurricular activities involve physical activity, such as sports teams, dance clubs, and outdoor clubs. These activities can help students maintain a healthy weight, improve their cardiovascular health, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. Additionally, participating in physical activity can improve a student's mental health by reducing stress, anxiety, and depression.

It encourages the exchange of ideas between classmates, and provides an opportunity for them to collaborate and combine resources. Group work also helps to foster and develop students’ social and communication skills. In order for students to get the most out of group work, teachers should actively facilitate the process. They can do this by establishing clear expectations for the project, providing supportive guidance to help keep the group on task, and outlining roles and responsibilities. Teachers should also be sure to assign tasks to individuals within the group as this helps provide accountability. 

There are three key reasons why teachers should encourage students to work together. First, it allows students to develop vital collaboration and conflict resolution skills which will benefit them when they enter the workplace. Second, it can lead to an increase in creative thinking and problem-solving abilities as class members work together to tackle complex tasks. Finally, group work gives students the opportunity to share their knowledge and learn from one another. 

Activities that are best suited for group work include ones that require problem-solving, research, debate, or peer-support.

6D2AFE5412CB,"As an 8th grader, I have been thinking a lot about high school and how it can be improved. One idea that I have come across is the possibility of completing high school in three years instead of the traditional four. While this may seem like a great idea at first, there are both pros and cons to consider.

One of the main advantages of finishing high school in three years is the ability to take classes before and after school. This means that students can get a head start on their education and potentially graduate early. This can be especially helpful for students who have a lot of passion or talent in a particular area, as they can focus on that area and get a jump start on their college education. Additionally, students who finish high school in three years may have more time to take advanced classes or participate in extracurricular activities, which can look great on college applications.

Another advantage of finishing high school in three years is that students may not have to take as many elective classes. While elective classes can be fun and interesting, they are not always necessary for a student's academic success. By cutting out electives, students can focus more on core classes and get a better education overall.

However, there are also some potential drawbacks to finishing high school in three years. One of the biggest concerns is that students may feel tired or burnt out from coming early or staying late for classes. This can be especially true if a student is also participating in extracurricular activities or working a part-time job. Additionally, some students may struggle with the increased workload and pressure of taking more classes in a shorter amount of time.

In terms of how finishing high school in three years prepares students for college, it can be both a pro and a con. On the one hand, students who finish high school early may have an advantage when it comes to college admissions, as they have more time to focus on their college applications and take advanced classes. On the other hand, students who finish high school early may also feel more pressure to get into college and may struggle with the transition to college life.

Overall, while there are both pros and cons to finishing high school in three years, I believe that it can be a good option for some students. However, it is important to carefully consider the potential drawbacks and make sure that it is the right",1,0.99338585,1,True
falcon_180b_v1_707,"In today's digital age, the role of libraries has been a debatable topic. Some believe that with the rise of technology, the need for physical libraries is diminishing while others argue that they are as important as ever. I believe that libraries continue to play a crucial role in our society and their importance should not be underestimated.

Firstly, libraries serve as community hubs where people can come together to learn, collaborate and engage in various activities. They provide quiet spaces for individuals to study or read, host events such as book clubs and author talks, and offer resources like computers and internet access for those who may not have these facilities at home. For example, my local library hosts weekly coding workshops for kids, which has sparked an interest in technology among many young attendees. These types of programs foster community growth and encourage lifelong learning.

Secondly, despite the widespread availability of information online, libraries still hold vast amounts of knowledge in the form of books, journals, and other printed materials. Not everyone has access to the internet or can afford to buy books, so libraries provide equal opportunities for all to access information. Furthermore, library staff are trained professionals who can guide patrons in their research and help them navigate through the vast sea of information more effectively than any search engine could do.

Lastly, libraries also play a significant role in promoting literacy, particularly among children. They house diverse collections of books catering to different reading levels and interests, making them accessible to everyone. Libraries often run reading challenges and story-time sessions to encourage children to develop a love for reading. Studies have shown that children who read regularly perform better academically and have improved mental wellbeing. Therefore, libraries play a pivotal role in nurturing future generations by instilling a passion for reading.

In conclusion, although we live in a digital world, the importance of libraries cannot be overlooked. They serve as community centers, provide equitable access to information, and foster literacy. Hence, it is essential to continue supporting and investing in our libraries to ensure they remain relevant and beneficial for generations to come.### Instruction:

While homeschooling has its benefits, such as individualized attention and flexibility, attending classes through online or video conferencing can provide additional benefits such as safety, focus, and avoiding bad influence from others.

One of the main benefits of attending classes through online or video conferencing is safety. Homeschooled students may not have the same level of safety as students who attend traditional schools. For example, they may not have the same level of supervision or protection from bullies or other harmful individuals. By attending classes through online or video conferencing, homeschooled students can be in a safer environment, where they can focus on their studies without worrying about their safety.

Another benefit of attending classes through online or video conferencing is focus. Homeschooled students may struggle with distractions, such as television or social media, while studying. By attending classes through online or video conferencing, homeschooled students can be in a more controlled environment, where they can focus on their studies without distractions. This can lead to better academic performance and a higher likelihood of success in the future.

Finally, attending classes through online or video conferencing can help homeschooled students avoid bad influence from others.

DC247D62DB3E,"In today's world, the importance of following one's instincts and ideas cannot be understated. Whether it involves deciding how to pursue a career, form a relationship, or plan for the future, trusting your own judgment is a cornerstone of successful decision-making. Believing in oneself can be key to realising one's full potential and ensuring the most rewarding life experience.

Relying on external guidance and advice is a natural chip in the process of forming decisions, but in the end, it is your choices that will shape the life you create for yourself. Following someone else's ideas can prevent you from discovering solutions and opportunities that align with your best interests. As such, it is often better to develop and trust the wisdom of your own judgement than to rely solely on the opinions of others.

It is important to remember that instinct and ideas should only be used as a tool to make better and more informed decisions.

The Act of Kindness: A Life-Changer

Kindness is a simple act that can have a huge impact on someone's life. It's like a pebble thrown into a pond - it may start small, but it can create ripples that reach far and wide. When we are kind to others, it can change the way they feel about themselves and the way they interact with the world around them. It can even change the way we feel about ourselves!

One way that kindness can impact someone's life is by boosting their self-esteem. When we do something nice for someone else, it can make them feel appreciated and valued. This can help them feel better about themselves and their place in the world. For example, when my mom volunteered at a local food bank, she saw how happy it made the people who received the food. It made her feel good to know that she was helping someone in need.

Another way kindness can change someone's life is by creating a positive atmosphere. When we are kind to others, it can create a sense of community and belonging. People are more likely to open up and talk to each other when they feel comfortable and supported. For instance, when my friend Emily was going through a tough time, her classmates organized a surprise party to cheer her up. It made her feel loved and supported, and it showed her that she wasn't alone.

Kindness can also have a profound impact on our own lives. When we are kind to others, it can make us feel happier and more fulfilled. It can give us a sense of purpose and meaning, and it can help us develop empathy and compassion. For example, when I volunteer at my local animal shelter, I get to see the joy on the animals' faces when they are adopted. It makes me feel happy and fulfilled, and it reminds me of the importance of kindness.

In conclusion, kindness is a powerful force that can change someone's life in many ways. It can boost self-esteem, create a positive atmosphere, and even change the way we feel about ourselves. So, let's all try to be a little kinder to those around us,",1,0.99442816,1,True

To remain true to our convictions and steer away from the opinions of others, it is necessary to make a commitment to ourselves and our beliefs. This commitment should not be talked away, because when we go back on our word, we are only fooling ourselves. True accomplishments are achieved when focus is steadfast and we are mindful of the purpose behind our aims. To remain focused, it is important to take regular breaks and measure our progress against our goals. When any extraneous noise arises, be it from external or internal sources, it is important to resist becoming distracted and to stay accountable to our self-determined targets.

D8F9861CD318,"Completing four years of high school is often seen as the ideal educational path and is highly beneficial for students. While an extra year of schooling can seem intimidating, it results in a number of educational, personal, and professional advantages.

Those who complete the four year plan will find greater access to more rigorous coursework, enabling meaningful intellectual and personal growth. With access to a broader range of classes, students will be able to explore new interests while developing a deeper understanding of existing ones. Furthermore, extra categories of electives and enriched curricula are often available to those who take an additional year. This allows students to pursue meaningful extracurricular activities, participate in valuable internship and volunteer opportunities, or even attempt to fulfill early college credit requirements.

Though an extra year of school may mean a later start to college, the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. Students will be better equipped for college-level work, making them more likely to succeed in their academic pursuits. Additionally, having extra time to refine both their skills and interests can result in more competitive applications.

In contrast to the four year plan, opting for three years of high school does have its benefits. Most notably, students who graduate early may have the opportunity to enter college with a head start, allowing them to adjust quickly to college life and possibly graduate early.

Ultimately, the best course for each student is dependent on individual considerations and should be approached with due diligence. Taking the extra year of high school can have invaluable benefits, potentially providing immersive learning experiences to open doors for brighter futures.",1,0.9934829,1,True

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my opinion regarding the future of the Electoral College in our presidential elections. It is important to consider the arguments both for and against its retention. While some argue that the Electoral College is an outdated and unfair system, I believe that it serves a crucial purpose in our democracy and should be maintained. 

One of the key functions of the Electoral College is to ensure certainty of outcome. As stated in the Office of the Federal Register's text, the Electoral College system guarantees that the winning candidate's share of the electoral vote exceeds their share of the popular vote. This reduces the likelihood of disputes over the outcome, as seen in the 2000 election. It provides a clear and decisive result, preventing the need for run-off elections, as mentioned by Judge Richard A. Posner. This not only saves time and resources but also ensures a stable and efficient democratic process.

Additionally, the Electoral College promotes the idea of ""everyone's president,"" as explained by Judge Posner. By requiring presidential candidates to have trans-regional appeal, the Electoral College prevents any single region from dominating the electoral process. This ensures that candidates focus on the interests of all regions, rather than just the ones from which they can secure overwhelming support. In doing so, it guarantees that the president represents the entire nation and not just certain factions or regions.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system incentivizes candidates to pay attention to swing states, as argued by Judge Richard A. Posner. These states are crucial in determining the outcome of the election and, therefore, voters in these states receive more attention and information from the candidates. This encourages thoughtful voting and allows for the most affected and informed voters to have a greater say in determining the presidency.

The Electoral College also helps balance the political weight of large and small states, as Judge Richard A. Posner highlights. The mal-apportionment of the Senate, as dictated in the Constitution, gives smaller states in terms of population less representation in the political process. However, through the Electoral College, these smaller states receive more attention from presidential candidates during campaigning. This ensures they have a voice in the selection of the president, preventing larger states from completely overshadowing their interests.

While there are arguments against the Electoral College, such as those presented by Bradford Plumer, it is important to consider the practical reasons for retaining it. The system provides stability, prevents run-off elections, ensures broad appeal, and represents the interests of both large and small states. These practical reasons demonstrate that the Electoral College continues to serve a vital role in our democratic process.

In conclusion, I believe that the Electoral College should be kept in place for the election of the President of the United States. It serves as a crucial compromise between a popular vote and a vote in Congress, providing certainty, fairness, and representation for all states. The practical reasons outlined above demonstrate the value and importance of the Electoral College system.

Thank you for considering my opinion on this matter. I urge you to support the retention of the Electoral College in our presidential elections. Please feel free to contact me if you have any further questions or require additional information.

Yours sincerely,

Playing sports can be super fun and awesome, but it also has some pretty cool benefits too. Like, did you know that playing sports can help you get better grades? Yeah, it's true! When you play sports, you learn how to work hard and stick with something, which can help you in school too. Plus, it's a great way to get exercise and stay healthy.

But, there are also some pretty cool disadvantages to playing sports. For one thing, it can be really hard to balance schoolwork and sports. Sometimes you might have to miss out on important school stuff, like tests or projects, to go to games or practices. And if you're not careful, you might get hurt and miss even more school. That's no fun!

Another thing is, playing sports can be really competitive, and sometimes it can feel like everyone is trying to one-up each other. It can be hard to stay positive and not get too upset if you're not doing as well as your teammates or if you're not getting as much playing time as you want. But, it's important to remember that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses, and it's okay if you're not the best at everything.

Overall, playing sports can be a really great experience, but it's important to be aware of both the advantages and disadvantages.

You can draw influence from a number of different sources and combine them to create a unique, memorable character. The possibilities are endless, whether you’re inspired by a favorite book, movie, or video game, or just make it up entirely.

When crafting your character, consider any improvements you could make to the original source material. For example, if your character is based on a beloved movie or TV show character, play around with the unique qualities that make them so memorable - but with your own spin. This could mean changing the character’s back story, career path, relationships, challenges faced, or even their physical appearance.

Be sure to take the time to really think through the emotions and motivations that drive your character. What drives them? What is their deepest desire? By doing this, you can create a fully-formed character who feels real and is memorable to your audience.

falcon_180b_v1_787,"Standardized Testing: An Inaccurate Measure of Student Ability

Standardized testing is a highly debated topic in the world of education. These tests are often used to determine a student's ability, but I believe that they are not an accurate measure of intelligence. In this essay, I will share my reasons and examples to support why standardized testing is flawed.

Firstly, standardized tests only assess a narrow range of skills. These tests tend to focus on reading, writing, and math, which means that other important talents such as creativity, problem-solving, and critical-thinking are not considered. For instance, I know a student in my class who struggles with math but is an excellent artist. However, when it comes to standardized testing, his artistic talents are not considered, and he is judged based solely on his math skills. This approach is unfair and does not give the full picture of a student's abilities.

Secondly, standardized tests do not take into account the different learning styles that students have. Some students are visual learners, while others are auditory or kinesthetic learners. Standardized tests are typically designed to cater to visual learners only, which puts students with different learning styles at a disadvantage. For example, one of my classmates struggles with reading and prefers to learn through hands-on activities. However, during standardized testing, he has to rely on his reading skills, which puts him at a disadvantage compared to visual learners in the same class.

Lastly, standardized tests are often influenced by external factors such as a student's socio-economic background, language proficiency, and prior education. These factors can impact a student's performance on the test, which in turn affects their overall score. For instance, a student who comes from a low-income background may not have access to the same resources as a student from a more affluent family, which can affect their performance on standardized tests. This approach is unfair and does not allow for a level playing field.

In conclusion, standardized tests are an inaccurate measure of student ability. They only assess a narrow range of skills, do not account for different learning styles, and are often influenced by external factors. As a result, we need to find alternative methods of assessing student abilities that are fair, comprehensive, and cater to different learning styles. Only then can we get a true picture of a student's abilities and provide them with the support they need to succeed.",1,0.9931899,1,True

One of the main advantages of attending a traditional school is the opportunity for face-to-face interaction with teachers and classmates. This allows for real-time feedback and the ability to ask questions in person. Additionally, attending a traditional school provides a structured environment with set schedules and routines that can help students stay organized and motivated.

On the other hand, taking classes online offers more flexibility and convenience. Students can attend classes from the comfort of their own home, which can be especially beneficial for those with busy schedules or difficult commutes. Online classes also often have a wider range of resources and materials available, such as videos, readings, and interactive quizzes.

However, there are also potential disadvantages to both methods. For example, attending a traditional school can be more expensive, as it often requires tuition, books, and other materials. Additionally, online classes may require a computer and internet connection, which not all students have access to.

In terms of learning outcomes, research has shown that both online and traditional classroom learning can be effective. However, some studies have suggested that students taking classes online may have a slight advantage in terms of self-motivation and the ability to learn at their own pace.

When it comes to standard educational tests such as the SOL, students studying online or at home may perform similarly to those attending a traditional school. However, it's important to note that these tests are just one measure of learning outcomes, and there are many other factors that can contribute to a student's success.

Finally, social interaction is an important aspect of the educational experience. While attending a traditional school provides opportunities for face-to-face interaction with classmates and teachers, online classes may require students to be more proactive in seeking out social interaction. This can be challenging for some students, but there are many online resources and communities available to help students connect with others.

In conclusion, both online and traditional classroom learning have their advantages and disadvantages. The potential impacts on learning outcomes and social interaction are important factors to consider when deciding which method is best for a particular student.

The meat industry is a major contributor to climate change. Livestock farming produces more greenhouse gases than all the cars, trucks, and planes in the world combined. This is because cows and other animals produce methane, which is a powerful greenhouse gas. By reducing our meat consumption, we can help reduce the amount of methane in the atmosphere.

Vegetarian and vegan diets are also healthier. Studies have shown that people who eat less meat have a lower risk of heart disease, cancer, and other health problems. For example, a study by the American Heart Association found that people who followed a vegetarian diet had a 32% lower risk of heart disease than those who ate meat.

Furthermore, a vegetarian or vegan diet can be more sustainable. It takes much less land, water, and energy to produce a plant-based meal than a meat-based one. This means that we can feed more people with less resources, which is important in a world where the population is growing rapidly.

Of course, there are some people who argue against vegetarian and vegan diets. They say that humans have been eating meat for millions of years, and that it is an important part of our culture. They also say that meat is a good source of protein and other nutrients.

While it is true that humans have been eating meat for a long time, it is also true that we have evolved to be able to survive on a plant-based diet. In fact, many of the world's most successful athletes are vegans or vegetarians. For example, tennis star Serena Williams has been following a vegan diet since 2012, and she says it has helped her stay fit and healthy.

In conclusion, I believe that adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet is a good idea. It is better for the environment, and it can reduce the risk of heart disease and other health problems.

7f125b41,"The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage has become an increasingly popular topic of discussion in recent years, and for good reason. With the negative impact that car emissions have on the environment and the health hazards associated with increased air pollution, it is important to consider the advantages of reducing our reliance on cars. Several articles highlight the benefits of limiting car usage, including ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal and ""The End of Car Culture,"" also by Elisabeth Rosenthal. These articles provide evidence to support the advantages of reducing car usage, such as improved air quality, decreased greenhouse gas emissions, and the creation of more sustainable communities.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the improvement in air quality. Cars are a major source of air pollution, releasing harmful pollutants into the atmosphere. In the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" it is stated that automobiles are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can significantly decrease air pollution and improve the quality of the air we breathe.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse gases contribute to global warming and climate change, which have far-reaching consequences for the environment and human health. The article ""The End of Car Culture"" mentions President Obama's goals to curb greenhouse gas emissions and how a decrease in driving can contribute to achieving these goals. By driving less and finding alternative modes of transportation, such as biking or public transit, we can greatly reduce our carbon footprint and help combat climate change.

Additionally, limiting car usage can lead to the creation of more sustainable communities. The article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" discusses an experimental new district in Germany called Vauban, where street parking and driveways are forbidden, and car ownership is limited. This community promotes a car-free lifestyle by providing accessible public transportation and placing stores within walking distance. By designing communities that prioritize walking, biking, and public transit, we can reduce our dependence on cars and create more sustainable and livable neighborhoods.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers several advantages, including improved air quality, decreased greenhouse gas emissions, and the creation of more sustainable communities. The articles discussed provide evidence to support these advantages and highlight the importance of reducing our reliance on cars. By finding alternative modes of transportation and designing communities that prioritize walking and public transit, we can make significant progress towards a more sustainable future.",1,0.9924697,1,True

Dear Senator [Senator’s Last Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the issue of whether the United States should keep the Electoral College or change to a system of election by popular vote for the president. After carefully considering the arguments from various sources, I firmly believe that the Electoral College should be kept for the following reasons.

One of the primary advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome. As stated by Judge Richard A. Posner, the candidate who wins the electoral vote almost always exceeds their share of the popular vote. This means that the winner is more likely to have a clear majority and a strong mandate to govern. In contrast, a popular vote system could result in close elections, and the potential for disputes and run-off elections, as seen in the examples of Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992. The Electoral College avoids such complications and ensures a clear winner.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system ensures that every region of the country has a say in the election of the president. As Judge Posner argues, a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. By requiring candidates to have trans-regional appeal, the Electoral College ensures that the president represents and takes into account the interests of all regions. This prevents one region from dominating the election and gives a voice to voters in states that might otherwise be overlooked.

Additionally, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. This forces candidates to not only target densely populated areas but also reach out to voters in states where the outcome is not predetermined. This means that candidates are more likely to listen to the concerns and issues of voters in these states, making their campaigns more inclusive and representative. In a popular vote system, candidates would have little incentive to campaign in states they know they have no chance of winning, which could lead to certain states being ignored.

Another benefit of the Electoral College is that it balances the influence of large states with smaller ones. By awarding electoral votes based on representation in Congress, the Electoral College ensures that states with smaller populations still have a significant say in the election. This is important for maintaining a fair and equitable system where the voices and concerns of all citizens, regardless of their state's size, are taken into consideration. In a purely popular vote system, large states would have a disproportionately large influence, potentially marginalizing smaller states.

While critics argue that the winner-take-all system in the Electoral College leads to a lack of attention to non-swing states, it must be acknowledged that candidates cannot campaign in every state. The Electoral College forces candidates to strategically focus on states where they have the best chance of winning. This allows candidates to reach a larger number of voters overall and ensures that the interests of various regions are taken into account.

In conclusion, the Electoral College should be kept because it provides certainty of outcome, ensures trans-regional appeal for candidates, encourages attention to swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While no system is perfect, the Electoral College strikes a balance between the preferences of the individual states and the need for a clear winner with broad support.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I hope that you carefully consider the benefits of keeping the Electoral College when making decisions regarding our electoral system.

Sincerely,

D684AE8A9418,"Humans have a natural desire to ""fit in"" in society but often this can come at a price. One of the most common ways in which people attempt to fit in is by imitating others, especially those we admire and aspire to be like. While this can be seen as an advantage – allowing us to pick up positive qualities from role models who are already successful – it can also have drawbacks. For example, by trying to fit in and act a certain way, we can become afraid of making mistakes; we become so fixated with blending in that we can unwittingly compromise our own character and originality. 

At the same time, it is important to recognize that often our character is formed by several influences beyond our control.

Introduction:
The concept of driverless cars has been a topic of interest for many years, with proponents arguing that it will revolutionize the way we travel and opponents raising concerns about safety and reliability. After reading the article ""Driverless Cars are Coming,"" I believe that the development of driverless cars should be halted until further notice.

Body:
One of the main concerns about driverless cars is their safety. According to the article, driverless cars rely on sensors and software to navigate, which can be affected by weather conditions, road construction, and other factors. In addition, the article states that hackers can potentially gain access to the system and cause accidents. This raises serious doubts about the reliability of driverless cars, particularly when it comes to safety.

Moreover, driverless cars would result in job loss for millions of people who work in the transportation industry, such as taxi drivers, truck drivers, and delivery drivers. As stated in the article, this could lead to significant economic hardship for those who are displaced.

Another argument against driverless cars is the potential for increased traffic congestion. The article mentions that driverless cars could increase traffic congestion, particularly in cities, as they may not be able to navigate through crowded streets effectively. This could lead to longer commute times and increased frustration for commuters.

Finally, the article mentions the ethical concerns surrounding driverless cars. For instance, in situations where an accident is unavoidable, the car must decide who to save and who to sacrifice. This raises questions about the accountability and transparency of the decision-making process.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the development of driverless cars should be halted until further notice. While the concept may have some benefits, such as increased convenience and reduced fuel consumption, the potential risks and negative consequences outweigh the advantages. The safety concerns, potential job loss, increased traffic congestion, and ethical issues mentioned in the article all support my argument against the development of driverless cars.

However, before I decide to pursue this career path, I have done extensive research on the duties and requirements of becoming a forensic scientist.

Firstly, I have learned that forensic scientists are responsible for collecting and analyzing physical evidence from crime scenes.

9653A4188D80,"Character Traits: The Choice is Yours

Character traits are the personality characteristics that define an individual. They are the qualities that make a person unique and shape their behavior and interactions with others. But are these traits something that we choose for ourselves, or are they influenced by external factors? In this essay, I will explore the role of choice and influence in shaping our character traits and the consequences of each choice.

On one hand, it is possible that we have complete control over our character traits. We can choose to be kind, honest, and hardworking, just as we can choose to be mean, dishonest, and lazy. However, this viewpoint does not take into account the many external factors that can shape our personalities. For example, our upbringing, environment, and social interactions can all play a significant role in shaping our character traits.

For instance, if a person is raised in a loving and supportive environment, they are more likely to develop positive character traits such as empathy and compassion. On the other hand, if a person is raised in a toxic environment, they may develop negative character traits such as aggression and hostility. Similarly, our social interactions can also shape our character traits. The people we surround ourselves with can influence our behavior and attitudes, and can help to mold us into the person we become.

On the other hand, it can also be argued that our character traits are largely influenced by external factors beyond our control. Our genes, for example, can play a significant role in shaping our personality. Research has shown that certain personality traits, such as extroversion and introversion, are heritable and can be influenced by genetics. Additionally, our environment and upbringing can also have a significant impact on our character traits, even if we have no control over them.

I am writing to propose a new policy that I believe would greatly benefit our school and community. As an eighth-grade student, I have seen firsthand the impact that community service can have on individuals and society as a whole. I strongly believe that requiring students to perform community service would not only benefit our community, but also provide valuable life experiences for our students.

Community service allows students to give back to their community and make a positive impact on the world around them. By volunteering their time and resources, students can help those in need and make a difference in the lives of others. This not only helps to build a sense of empathy and compassion in students, but also teaches them the importance of giving back to their community.

In addition to the personal benefits, community service can also have a positive impact on our school and community as a whole. By volunteering, students can learn valuable skills such as communication, teamwork, and leadership. These skills can be applied in a variety of settings, both in and out of school, and can help to prepare students for future success.

Furthermore, community service can help to build stronger relationships between students, teachers, and the community. By working together to volunteer and give back, students can develop a sense of pride and belonging in their community. This can help to foster a sense of civic responsibility and encourage students to continue to give back to their community throughout their lives.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that requiring students to perform community service would be a valuable addition to our school's curriculum. By giving back to our community, students can develop valuable life experiences, learn valuable skills, and build stronger relationships with those around them. I urge you to consider this proposal and I look forward to discussing it further.

llama_70b_v1892,"As a high school student, I strongly believe that students should have the right to grade their teachers. By allowing students to evaluate their teachers, we can provide valuable feedback that can help teachers improve their teaching methods and better meet the needs of their students.

One of the main reasons why students should be able to grade their teachers is that it allows us to express our opinions and have a say in our own education. Students are the ones who spend the most time with their teachers, and we are often the best equipped to evaluate their effectiveness. By giving us the opportunity to provide feedback, we can help teachers identify areas where they may need to improve, such as their teaching style or classroom management techniques.

Another reason why student evaluations are important is that they can help to foster a better relationship between teachers and students. When teachers know that their students are evaluating them, they may be more likely to take an interest in their students' needs and concerns. This can lead to a more collaborative and supportive learning environment, where students feel comfortable asking questions and seeking help when they need it.

Furthermore, student evaluations can help to identify and address any biases or prejudices that teachers may have. For example, if a teacher consistently receives low ratings from students of color or students from different cultural backgrounds, it may indicate that they have a problem with unconscious bias that needs to be addressed. By giving students a voice in the evaluation process, we can help to ensure that all students receive a fair and equitable education.

Some people may argue that students are not qualified to evaluate their teachers, but I believe that this is a shortsighted view. Students are the ones who are most affected by a teacher's performance, and we are often the best equipped to identify areas where they may need to improve. Additionally, by giving students the opportunity to evaluate their teachers, we can help to develop our critical thinking and communication skills, which are essential for success in any field.

In conclusion, I firmly believe that students should have the right to grade their teachers. By providing valuable feedback and promoting a better relationship between teachers and students, student evaluations can help to improve the quality of education and create a more supportive and inclusive learning environment. I urge my fellow students to join me in advocating for this important right, so that we can have a greater say in our own education and help to ensure that our teachers are providing us with the best possible education.",1,0.99458814,1,True

Third, gun controll is not about taking away our rights. Its about being resposible with the rights we have. We can still have guns for hunting and stuff like that. But, we need to make shure that guns are not getting into the wrong hands.

Fourth, stricter gun controll laws would help stop gun violsnce. If it was harder to get guns, then peopel who want to do bad things would have a harder time getting them. This would make our communites safer.

Last, other countrys have stricter gun controll laws and they are doing fine. For example, in Canada, you have to have a lisens to have a gun and they don't have as much gun violsnce as us.

However, this idea simply isn't true. Life throws curveballs at us all the time—whether it be a nasty breakup, the death of a loved one, or coming face-to-face with a person who does not share our morality. A positive attitude will not alleviate these challenges; instead, one must face them head-on in order to move past them. 

We can choose to think positively in these life-altering situations, sure, but no amount of optimism will erase the fact that these events are difficult and will take immense strength and resilience to push through. It's unrealistic to think we can simply float through life without going through any hardship by having a positive attitude alone. 

It's not wrong to view life through a positive lens; but we cannot solely rely on this kind of comedic realism when reality is sometimes anything but funny.

falcon_180b_v1_295,"As a sixth grader, I believe that a vegetarian or vegan diet is not necessary for everyone. While I understand that reducing meat consumption can benefit the environment and improve health conditions, it's important to recognize that not everyone has the resources or desire to adopt such diets. It's also true that there are some people who need meat in order to maintain proper nutrition levels.

Firstly, many individuals and families cannot afford a vegetarian or vegan lifestyle, as plant-based foods can often be more expensive or difficult to find. It's important to consider those who do not have the resources to purchase or access these types of foods, as forcing this diet onto them would not be fair or realistic.

Secondly, some people require meat as part of their diet in order to maintain proper nutrition levels. For example, athletes often require high amounts of protein to keep their muscles healthy and functioning properly. Without meat, it can be challenging to get adequate protein and other essential vitamins and nutrients.

Lastly, I think that people should have the freedom to decide for themselves what they want to eat, as long as their choices are not harmful to others. It's important to recognize that not everyone shares the same beliefs, and we should respect each other's decisions and lifestyles.

In conclusion, while reducing meat consumption can be beneficial for some people and for the environment, it's not necessarily the best choice for everyone. It's important to recognize and respect each other's choices, and make the best decisions for ourselves based on our own personal beliefs and needs.",1,0.9939184,1,True
F44D5A636C2F,"First impressions are often the first thing we notice about someone. We may form an opinion about them based on their appearance, behavior, or even their name. However, it is important to remember that first impressions can be changed and are often unreliable.

One reason why first impressions can be unreliable is that they are often based on limited information. We may only have a few minutes to interact with someone before forming an opinion about them. This means that we may not have enough time to get to know them or understand their true character. For example, if we meet someone in a crowded room, we may only have a brief moment to observe them before moving on. In this case, our first impression may be based on a single action or behavior that does not accurately represent who they are.

Another reason why first impressions can be unreliable is that they are often influenced by our own biases and assumptions. We may have certain expectations or preconceptions about someone based on their appearance, age, or other factors. These biases can lead us to form an opinion about them that is not based on accurate information. For example, if we meet someone who is wearing a suit and tie, we may assume that they are wealthy or successful. However, this may not be the case, as they may be wearing the suit for a job interview or other reason.

Additionally, first impressions can be changed through actions and behaviors that contradict our initial opinion. For example, if we meet someone who seems quiet and reserved, we may assume that they are shy or introverted. However, if we later see them in a social setting and they are outgoing and confident, our first impression may be completely different.

In conclusion, first impressions are often unreliable and can be changed through actions and behaviors that contradict our initial opinion. It is important to remember that we should not form an opinion about someone based on limited information or our own biases and assumptions.

A42A8E5FA4CD,"Being independent is a way for people to be unshackled from the expectations and opinions of other people and step out from the shadows of society. Being yourself is a way for people to think for themselves and make their own decisions, free from outside influences. People who become independent by being themselves reflect their own authentic values and beliefs in their decisions, allowing them to become more confident and in control of their destiny.

The advantages of being true to yourself and remaining independent in this way can be seen in areas such as career decisions, financial decisions, and relationships. Independent individuals have the freedom to make decisions which will directly affect the life they are leading, without any external pressure from other people or society. Likewise, depending on someone else can have both positive and negative repercussions. On one hand, it can provide a strong support system of guidance and perspective, but on the other hand, it can create an environment of constraints and ‘shoulds’.

For example, Caitlyn decided to become independent by pursuing a career in web development. In doing so, she was able to explore her talent for coding, as well as her passion, while feeling in control of her own future. On the other hand, Mary was encouraged by her family to pursue a degree in Biology, but not for her own enjoyment or interests. Here, the lack of independence meant that Mary felt pressured to make a decision which wasn’t right for her, consequently leading to her dropping out of school.

In conclusion, becoming independent by being yourself can have a positive impact on personal decisions, bringing about more confidence and allowing you to make better choices which reflect your own values and beliefs. However, depending on someone else can also provide guidance and support if used correctly. Ultimately, the decision of whether to be independent or depend on someone else should be made mindfully, and not due to external pressures or expectations.",1,0.99468744,1,True
78A3B43DFF8E,"Winston Churchill once said, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts."" While I understand the sentiment behind this statement, I believe that success is not just about having the courage to continue in the face of failure, but also about the ability to learn from those failures and use them as stepping stones towards success.

Throughout my life, I have experienced both successes and failures, and I have learned valuable lessons from each one. For example, when I was in the 6th grade, I tried out for the school's debate team. I had been practicing for weeks, but on the day of the tryouts, I was nervous and didn't perform my best. I was disappointed when I didn't make the team, but instead of giving up, I decided to take the feedback I received and use it to improve my skills. I practiced even more, sought out feedback from my teachers, and eventually made the team the following year.

Similarly, when I took my first math test in the 7th grade, I got a score of 50 out of 100. While I was disappointed, I knew that I could improve. I asked my teacher for help, studied more, and took practice tests. By the time the next test came around, I had improved my score by 10 points.

In both of these examples, I was able to learn from my failures and use them as stepping stones towards success. I believe that this is the true definition of success, not just the ability to continue in the face of failure.

Furthermore, I believe that the loss of enthusiasm is not a necessary component of success. In fact, I believe that enthusiasm is what drives us towards success. When we are enthusiastic about something, we are more likely to put in the hard work and effort necessary to achieve our goals. We are more likely to take risks and try new things, even when we may fail.

In conclusion, while Winston Churchill's statement about success is inspiring, I believe that it is not the whole picture. Success is not just about having the courage to continue in the face of failure, but also about the ability to learn from those failures and use them as stepping stones towards success.

Hey, Mrs. Johnson! Here's my essay on the importance of persistence through failure.

So, I know we've been talking about how some people have achieved success without really trying, but I think it's way more important to look at people who failed a bunch of times before they finally made it big. Like, think about it, if they just gave up after the first or second failure, we wouldn't be talking about them today!

First up, let's talk about Thomas Edison. He's the guy who invented the light bulb, right? But did you know he actually failed over a thousand times before he finally got it to work?! Like, what?! That's crazy! But he didn't give up, and now we have light bulbs because of it.

Next, there's J.K. Rowling. She wrote the Harry Potter books, duh, but did you know she was rejected by like 12 publishers before one finally said yes?! That's insane! But she kept going, and now she's one of the most famous authors ever.

llama_70b_v11128,"Dear teacher,

I think that the legalization of marijuana is a very important topic that people have been talking about for a long time. Some people think it's a good idea, while others don't. In my opinion, I think that marijuana should be legalized.

First of all, marijuana is not a dangerous drug like other drugs such as cocaine or heroin. According to the CDC, alcohol is way more harmful than marijuana. If alcohol is legal, then why not marijuana? It doesn't make sense. Marijuana can also be used for medical purposes. Some people have diseases that can be cured or helped by marijuana. For example, people with cancer can use it to help with their pain.

Another reason why marijuana should be legal is that it can help with stress. Nowadays, a lot of people are stressed out and marijuana can help them relax. It's also a safer alternative to other drugs like Xanax or Valium, which can be addictive.

Additionally, legalizing marijuana can help the government make money. If marijuana is legal, then the government can tax it and use that money to fund important things like schools, hospitals, and roads.

However, some people argue that marijuana is a gateway drug. This means that people who use marijuana might start using other drugs like cocaine or heroin. But, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, there is no scientific evidence that proves that marijuana is a gateway drug.

Furthermore, some people say that marijuana can cause brain damage. But, the American Psychological Association states that marijuana use does not have a significant impact on cognitive function.

In conclusion, marijuana should be legalized because it's not a dangerous drug, it can be used for medical purposes, it can help with stress, and it can help the government make money. There are no good reasons to keep it illegal.

falcon_180b_v1_259,"I believe summer projects should be student-designed rather than teacher-designed. This is because it allows students to take ownership of their learning and pursue their own interests. If a student is passionate about a topic, they are more likely to engage with the material and produce a higher quality project.

For example, I know of a student who was really interested in environmental issues. Instead of being given a generic assignment by their teacher, they designed their own project that involved researching the impact of single-use plastics on the environment and finding ways to reduce their own plastic usage. This project was more meaningful and engaging for the student because it was based on their own interests.

Additionally, student-designed projects can foster creativity and critical thinking skills. By allowing students to come up with their own project ideas, they are encouraged to think outside the box and find unique solutions to problems. This can lead to more innovative and original projects that truly showcase a student's abilities.

On the other hand, teacher-designed projects can be limiting and may not align with a student's interests or abilities. While teachers may have their students' best interests at heart, they cannot truly understand every individual's passions and strengths. As a result, a teacher-designed project may not be as effective in promoting learning and growth.

In conclusion, I believe that summer projects should be left up to the students to design.

963501C88479,"Failure is an inevitable part of life, and it is no different in the pursuit of success. There are various views on how failure plays a role in the pursuit of success. While some people see failure as a setback that can be used to learn and grow, others view it as a reason to give up or as a roadblock to success. In my opinion, failure can be both a positive and negative factor in the pursuit of success.

On the positive side, failure can be used as a learning experience. When we fail, we are forced to reevaluate our approach and find new ways to achieve our goals. Failure can also help us develop resilience, which is the ability to bounce back from adversity. By experiencing failure and learning from it, we become stronger and more capable of achieving success in the future.

On the negative side, failure can cause people to give up. When we fail, it can be easy to feel discouraged and defeated. This can lead to a loss of motivation and a decrease in effort. Failure can also cause people to become complacent and stop striving for success altogether.

However, failure can also lead to success. Many successful people have experienced failure at some point in their lives, but they used it as a stepping stone to greater success. For example, J.K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter series, faced numerous rejections before finally finding a publisher. However, she continued to write and eventually achieved great success.

However, failure can also lead to success, as many successful people have demonstrated.

Subject: The Importance of the Electoral College

Dear [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the continuation of the Electoral College in the United States presidential elections. While some argue for a change to a system based on a popular vote, I believe that preserving the Electoral College has its merits and provides several advantages that promote fairness, stability, and representation.

One of the main benefits of the Electoral College is that it ensures a certainty of outcome. As mentioned in ""In Defense of the Electoral College"" by Judge Richard A. Posner, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College generally exceeds their share of the popular vote. This reduces the chances of a dispute over the election outcome, as the state by state winner-takes-all system provides a definitive result for each state. In comparison, a direct popular vote could lead to prolonged disputes, as witnessed in the 2000 election.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it promotes the idea of a president for everyone. ""Everyone's President"" is a term used by Posner to describe how the Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. This means that candidates must appeal to voters from different regions and not solely focus on one particular area. As a result, candidates are encouraged to address the concerns and interests of individuals from diverse regions, fostering a sense of unity and giving everyone a stake in the outcome of the election.

Furthermore, the Electoral College system encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, as highlighted in Posner's article. These states are crucial in determining the election outcome, and the winner-takes-all approach motivates candidates to invest time and resources in these swing states. This leads to greater engagement and attention from voters in these states, allowing them to make informed decisions and have a more significant impact on the election.

The Electoral College also provides representation to smaller states, as mentioned in Posner's article. By allocating electoral votes based on the number of representatives in Congress, small states receive a more proportionate share of the electoral vote. This counteracts the potential imbalance caused by the mal-apportionment of the Senate. Consequently, presidential candidates are obliged to address the concerns of voters in both small and large states, ensuring a more balanced representation of the country's interests.

Lastly, the Electoral College saves the nation from the need for runoff elections. As highlighted by Posner, this method reduces the chances of a presidential election where no candidate receives a majority of the votes. A runoff election would greatly complicate the electoral process and potentially hinder the smooth transition of power. The Electoral College resolves this issue by producing a clear winner, even if they don't achieve a majority of the popular vote.

In conclusion, the Electoral College serves as a vital component of the United States' presidential election system. It provides stability, representation for smaller states, trans-regional appeal for candidates, and a clear outcome. While some argue for a change to a popular vote system, the advantages offered by the Electoral College outweigh the potential disadvantages. I urge you to consider these points when making decisions regarding the future of our presidential elections.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.

This not only helps the community, but it also allows individuals to feel a sense of fulfillment and purpose.

Another reason why community service is important is that it teaches individuals the importance of responsibility.

Adding more hours to the school day could have some pretty big consequences for students, teachers, and the school itself. At first, it might seem like a good idea to get more learning in, but it could actually end up being a bad thing for everyone involved.

For students, having more hours in school could be really tiring and stressful. We already have a lot of work to do in school, and adding more hours means we'll have even more homework and projects to worry about. It could be hard to balance all of that with our extracurricular activities and personal lives, and it could even affect our grades. Plus, who wants to be in school even longer? It feels like we're already there all day, every day!

For teachers, adding more hours to the school day could be a nightmare. They already have a lot of work to do, grading papers and preparing lessons, and adding more hours means they'll have even more to do. They might not be able to keep up with all of the extra work, and it could lead to burnout and stress. Plus, they might not be able to give us the individual attention we need to really learn and succeed.

For the school itself, adding more hours could be really expensive. We'd need more staff and resources to accommodate the extra time, like more teachers, classrooms, and materials. It could be a big financial burden for the school, and it might not be worth it in the end.

In my opinion, adding more hours to the school day isn't the best idea. It could cause more problems than it solves, and it's not fair to students, teachers, or the school.

For example, when I was on my high school's soccer team, I was content to be a middle-of-the-pack player, when I had the potential to be one of the best players. Similarly, while looking for a job after college, I was all too happy to take the first offer that came my way, rather than researching other opportunities that could have made for a challenging, yet rewarding career.

As time passed and I set my goals higher, I began to see the positive repercussions of this decision. On the soccer team, I pushed myself to excel on the field, eventually becoming team captain in my senior season. In the professional world, I chose to take the time and actively explore new opportunities that have let me grow as an individual and be successful as a professional. Both of these present a clear link between Michelangelo’s words and my own experiences. With any effort we put forth in life, we must challenge ourselves to set goals that will push our limits and boundaries, so that we can reach our maximum potential.

As seen in my own life, Michelangelo’s words serve as a reminder that setting our sights too low is a greater danger than failing to reach an ambitious goal. To quote the artist himself, “The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark.” By seeking to challenge one’s self and remaining ambitious, a person can submit themselves to a path that may be difficult, but will ultimately lead to success in the long run.",1,0.9932681,1,True

It is the process of being confident in who you are and living your life honestly and authentically. Throughout history, there have been many examples of people seeking to be someone they are not. Whether it be to hide their true identities from an oppressive government, to fit in with a different social circle, or to simply chase a different version of themselves, this kind of transformation can have both positive and negative effects. 

On the one hand, a person may be able to reinvent themselves for the better, freeing themselves of the trappings of the past and emerging anew, unburdened by whatever shackles them. But on the other, they may be forced to change themselves in undesirable ways, potentially becoming cowardly in their attempt to fit in with their new environment. Furthermore, it can be difficult to return to the person they once were due to societal pressures, fear of what others may think, or simply a lack of the same spirit that led them to make the change in the first place.

D26C9B0368D0,"As an 8th grader, I strongly disagree with the idea of attending classes from home. I think it's important to be in a physical classroom with my peers and teacher to learn and grow. Here are some reasons why:

Firstly, being in a classroom allows for better interaction and collaboration with my classmates. When we're all in the same place, we can work together on projects, ask questions, and learn from each other. This helps us build stronger relationships and develop important social skills like communication and teamwork. Plus, it's way more fun to learn with friends than alone at home!

Secondly, attending classes in person allows for more engaging and interactive learning experiences. Our teacher can use visual aids, videos, and hands-on activities to make learning more exciting and interactive. When we're at home, it's harder to stay focused and engaged without these visual aids, which can lead to a less enjoyable and less effective learning experience.

Thirdly, being in a classroom helps us stay organized and manage our time better. Our teacher can provide us with a structured schedule and set deadlines for assignments, which helps us stay on track and avoid procrastination. When we're at home, it's easy to get distracted by TV, video games, or other things that aren't as important as our schoolwork.

Lastly, attending classes in person can help us develop important life skills like time management, self-discipline, and responsibility. When we're in a classroom, we have to learn how to manage our time, prioritize our tasks, and be responsible for our own learning. These skills are essential for success in both academics and life outside of school.

In conclusion, attending classes from home can have negative impacts on our learning experience. It can lead to a lack of interaction and collaboration with our peers, less engaging and interactive learning experiences, difficulty staying organized and managing our time, and a lack of development of important life skills.

falcon_180b_v1_558,"I believe that offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home can have its benefits. It provides students with the flexibility to learn at their own pace and can help them balance their schoolwork with other responsibilities they may have. For instance, if a student has a part-time job or is taking care of a family member, distance learning can allow them to continue their education without sacrificing their other obligations.

Furthermore, distance learning can also benefit students who struggle with traditional classroom settings due to anxiety, social difficulties, or other personal reasons. By attending classes from home, they can feel more comfortable and focused, which can improve their academic performance.

However, it is crucial to note that distance learning may not be suitable for everyone. Some students thrive in a traditional classroom setting, where they can interact with their peers and receive immediate feedback from their teachers. Additionally, distance learning requires a high level of self-discipline and motivation, which not all students possess.

In conclusion, while distance learning can be a valuable option for some students, it should not replace traditional classroom settings entirely. It is essential to provide students with a choice and determine which learning environment works best for them.",1,0.99404126,1,True
DDD1A1F08FDF,"As an eighth-grade student, I possess a talent that sets me apart from others: my ability to play the guitar. I have been playing the guitar for the past five years and have developed a strong skill set that allows me to create beautiful music.

One of the reasons why I am passionate about playing the guitar is because of the emotions it evokes. Music has the power to transport us to different places and times, and playing the guitar allows me to create that experience for myself and others. For example, when I play a slow, melancholic song, it brings me to tears because of the emotional intensity it creates. When I play a fast, upbeat song, it makes me feel alive and energized.

Another reason why I love playing the guitar is because of the creativity it allows. When I sit down to play, I never know what I am going to create. I can start with a simple chord progression and end up with a fully realized song. This creative freedom is what makes playing the guitar so exciting for me.

Furthermore, playing the guitar has allowed me to connect with others in a unique way. When I play at events or gatherings, people come up to me and start talking to me about music. We can bond over our shared love of music and discover new artists and songs together. This sense of community is what makes playing the guitar so rewarding for me.

In conclusion, my ability to play the guitar is a talent that sets me apart from others. It allows me to express my emotions, be creative, and connect with others in a meaningful way.

CEC6870D564F,"Cell phones have become increasingly common and accessible in today's world. As more people have access to phones and technology, the question arises of whether it is beneficial for students to have access to cell phones in classrooms. On one hand, phones can be a powerful educational tool. Students can easily access information, such as textbooks, sources, and online simulations, without having to carry a laptop or leave the classroom. They can also keep up with their own notes, presentations, or other activities in real-time, without having to wait for the end of the school day to type them up. Additionally, cell phones can provide an instant connection between the teacher and all of the students in the classroom. 

On the other hand, allowing cell phones in the classroom can be a distraction. Not only can social media be a major source of distraction, but students can also be tempted to text or call their friends during class. Additionally, cell phones can be easily misused as a cheating tool. With the availability of Google and other search engines, students may cheat on tests or quizzes by looking up answers on their cell phones. In addition, the accessibility of cell phones during class can also lead to a decrease in student participation, which is an important part of learning and growth.

Overall, allowing students to use cell phones in classrooms has both risks and benefits. On one hand, the advantages of having phones available for educational purposes are undeniable.

D344D0003B84,"Developing one's own talents and skills is essential for personal growth and success. It is important to believe in oneself and have appreciation for what one can do. In this essay, I will explain the importance of developing one's own talents and skills and how it can improve one's life.

Firstly, developing one's own talents and skills allows for personal growth. When we focus on what we are good at, we are able to improve and develop those skills further. This process of self-improvement can lead to a greater sense of self-awareness and confidence. For example, when I started taking dance classes, I was nervous and unsure of myself. However, as I continued to practice and improve, I gained a greater sense of self-assuredness and pride in my abilities. This growth not only helped me to become a better dancer, but also to become a more confident person overall.

Secondly, having appreciation and belief in oneself can help to reach one's goals. When we believe in ourselves and our abilities, we are more likely to take risks and pursue our dreams. This can lead to greater success and fulfillment in life. For example, a friend of mine always had a passion for music and wanted to become a singer. However, for years, she doubted her abilities and was afraid to take the leap. It wasn't until she started taking singing lessons and performing in public that she began to believe in herself and her talents. This newfound confidence allowed her to pursue her dream of becoming a professional singer, and she has since achieved great success in the industry.

In addition to personal growth and reaching one's goals, developing one's own talents and skills can also lead to greater happiness and fulfillment in life. When we are able to do something well and enjoy it, we are more likely to feel satisfied and content. For example, I love to paint and find it to be a relaxing and fulfilling hobby. When I am able to create something beautiful and express myself through art, I feel a sense of pride and accomplishment that brings me joy.

In conclusion, developing one's own talents and skills is essential for personal growth, reaching one's goals, and finding happiness and fulfillment in life. It is important to believe in oneself and have appreciation for what one can do. By focusing on self-improvement and",1,0.9948768,1,True
llama_70b_v1283,"The use of single-use plastic products has become a really big problem for the environment. Some people think we should ban them, but others don't. In this essay, I will argue for banning single-use plastics and give some reasons why.

First of all, single-use plastics are really bad for the environment. They pollute our oceans and waterways, and hurt animals that eat them or get tangled in them. For example, plastic bags can choke sea turtles and birds, and plastic microbeads can get into the food chain and hurt fish and other wildlife. It's also not good for humans, because we might eat fish that have eaten microbeads, and that's not good for our health.

Another reason we should ban single-use plastics is that they're not really necessary. We can use reusable bags, water bottles, and straws instead. For example, my mom always carries a reusable shopping bag in her purse, and she never has to use plastic bags. My friends and I also use reusable water bottles and straws, and it's easy and convenient.

Furthermore, single-use plastics are not really recyclable. Even if we put them in the recycling bin, they often don't get recycled properly. They might end up in landfills or oceans, and that's not good. In contrast, reusable products can be used many times, and then recycled properly when they're no longer useful.

Some people might argue that single-use plastics are cheap and convenient, but that's not a good enough reason to keep using them. We need to think about the future and the environment, not just about what's easy and cheap right now. We can't keep using products that harm the planet and its inhabitants.

In conclusion, banning single-use plastics is the right thing to do. It will help protect the environment, wildlife, and humans. We can use reusable products instead, which are just as convenient and not harmful. Let's all do our part to make the world a better place and ban single-use plastics!",1,0.93810785,1,True
80DD7EE85BF7,"Introduction: 
Longer school days have become a controversial issue as of late. While some argue that extending school days would have educational and social benefits, I am against the idea of adding one and a half hour to school days. This essay will detail four main reasons why this should not be implemented. 

Reason 1: We are already in school for 8 hours and it is too much. Eight hours is already a long time to spend in school. Times are different since the introduction of digital devices in education, and children may struggle to focus on tasks and activities so long into the day. As their brains tire, so does their capacity for learning.

Reason 2: We don't have enough time for personal activities. Having a longer school day would mean less free time in the afternoon for students to learn valuable activities, like how to manage their finances, pursue hobbies, cooking, time with family, and much more. 

Reason 3: Too much homework. Having a longer school day means more homework for students and puts greater pressure on them. Even if teachers spread out assignments and give manageable homework, a longer school day will result in massive piles of assignments. 

Reason 4: Appointments are missed. Students and their families may find it almost impossible to juggle appointments, such as counseling, medical, and a range of other services in and around a longer school day. Such appointments are crucial, and an impossibly long school day could lead to missed opportunities for numerous students.  

In conclusion, I believe the idea of adding another one and a half hours to school days should be abandoned in favor of shorter days and better educational methods. The additional time taken up by longer school days is unnecessary and could lead to detrimental consequences for both students and teachers.",1,0.9222125,1,True

eeace4bd,"Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Introduction:
Limiting car usage is an emerging trend in many parts of the world, driven by the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, promote alternative transportation, and create more sustainable and livable communities. Several case studies illustrate the advantages of limiting car usage, such as the car-free district of Vauban in Germany, the driving ban in Paris, and the car-free day in Bogota. By adopting smart planning strategies, reducing dependency on cars, and promoting alternative modes of transportation, cities and communities can benefit from cleaner air, reduced congestion, improved public health, and enhanced quality of life.

Body Paragraph 1: Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions
The transportation sector, particularly passenger cars, is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. According to the New York Times article, cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage, communities can make a substantial impact on reducing these emissions and combating climate change. The case of Vauban, Germany, where 70% of families do not own cars, demonstrates how a car-free lifestyle can significantly reduce carbon footprints.

Body Paragraph 2: Improved Air Quality and Public Health
Vehicular emissions are a major source of air pollution, especially in densely populated cities. The driving ban in Paris due to smog, as reported by the Chicago Tribune, resulted in a significant reduction in congestion and improved air quality. This temporary measure brought about a 60% decrease in congestion and highlighted the negative health effects of car usage. By limiting car usage, communities can enjoy cleaner air, reduce respiratory illnesses, and promote overall public health.

Body Paragraph 3: Reduced Congestion and Enhanced Livability
The introduction of car-free districts and car-free days, such as the ones in Vauban and Bogota respectively, showcase the potential for reduced congestion and enhanced livability. These initiatives create space for alternative modes of transportation like walking, biking, and public transit. The Seattle Times article on Bogota's car-free day highlights how millions of Colombians experienced a day devoid of traffic jams, promoting efficient transportation and a better urban environment. Additionally, car-free districts result in walkable communities with improved access to amenities like shops, schools, and parks.

Body Paragraph 4: Economic Benefits and Diverse Transportation Options 
Limiting car usage also has economic benefits. The New York Times article mentions how car ownership rates have declined even before the recession, indicating a broader cultural shift. This shift led companies like Ford and Mercedes to rebrand themselves as mobility companies with diverse product ranges beyond personal vehicles. By embracing alternative transportation options like car-sharing programs, bike-sharing, and public transit, communities enable residents to save money on transportation costs, reduce the need for parking spaces, and reduce the strain on infrastructure.

Conclusion:
Limiting car usage offers numerous advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. Case studies from across the world demonstrate the significant impact of reducing car dependency, from reduced greenhouse gas emissions and improved air quality to reduced congestion and enhanced livability. By adopting smart planning strategies, promoting alternative transportation, and rethinking the car-centric culture, communities can create sustainable, healthy, and accessible urban environments for all. Embracing these changes will not only benefit individuals but also contribute to the global effort to address climate change and build a better future.",1,0.9916025,1,True

So, the quote is ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" I think this quote is really important because it makes me realize that I can't just stay in my comfort zone and be happy with what I know. I need to challenge myself and try new things to become better. 💪

For example, in my math class, I used to think I was really good at multiplication and division. But then my teacher gave us a problem that was way harder than anything I'd ever done before. At first, I was like, ""Uh, nope. This is too hard."" But then I decided to try my best and see if I could do it. And guess what? I actually got it right! 😃 It was so cool to see that I was capable of more than I thought.

Another example is from a sports game I played recently. I'm not the best player on my team, but I always try my best. One game, we were losing by a lot, and our coach told us we needed to work harder if we wanted to win. So, I decided to take it upon myself to make some big shots and help my team catch up. And guess what? We won the game! 🏆 It was so exhilarating to know that I made a difference and helped my team succeed.

But, I also think that Emerson's quote can be kind of mean. Like, what if someone's really good at something and they don't want to try anything new? Shouldn't they be able to just enjoy what they're good at? 🤷‍♀️ I don't know, maybe I'm just not understanding the quote right.

Self-driving cars, also known as autonomous vehicles, are cars that are capable of navigating and operating without human intervention. They utilize various sensors and algorithms to perceive and interpret their surroundings. In the article “Driverless Cars are Coming,” the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars. As a result, there is a debate over whether self-driving cars should be developed or not. 

Body:
Firstly, driverless cars will significantly improve road safety. According to the article, “94% of road accidents in the US involve human error”. Self-driving cars are not prone to human error and will, therefore, decrease the rate of accidents on the road. Additionally, they do not get distracted or fatigued, which are common causes of accidents. As a result, the development and use of autonomous vehicles should be encouraged as they will save many lives.

Secondly, self-driving cars offer convenience and accessibility for people with disabilities or those who cannot drive. The article states that ""people who cannot drive due to age or disability make up 20% of the population"", and driverless cars can provide them with mobility and independence. Moreover, they will reduce the need for car ownership, which will decrease traffic congestion and parking problems in urban areas. 

However, the development of driverless cars has some drawbacks. One of them is job loss. The article explains that self-driving cars will lead to the automation of many jobs, such as trucking, delivery services, and taxi services, which will displace millions of workers. Additionally, the author argues that hackers may exploit the technology of self-driving cars to cause accidents and harm passengers.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, driverless cars have both advantages and disadvantages. Although they offer road safety, convenience, and accessibility, their development will lead to job loss and pose cybersecurity risks. Therefore, policymakers and stakeholders should weigh the pros and cons carefully before making a decision. However, I believe that the benefits of autonomous vehicles outweigh their drawbacks. With appropriate regulations and cybersecurity measures, self-driving cars can significantly improve our lives and make the world a safer place.",1,0.8777835,1,True
falcon_180b_v1_737,"The use of animals in scientific research has been a topic of ethical debate for many years. On one hand, animal testing has been crucial in advancing medical knowledge and developing life-saving treatments. On the other hand, the practice raises concerns about animal welfare and the morality of using sentient beings for human benefit. In my opinion, the harm inflicted on animals during testing outweighs the potential benefits, and thus, the use of animals in scientific research should be prohibited.

Firstly, animal testing often involves subjecting animals to painful and distressing procedures that cause harm and suffering. This can include exposing them to toxic chemicals, subjecting them to radiation or invasive surgery, and even deliberately infecting them with diseases. Animals used in testing are often kept in small cages with little to no stimulation, leading to psychological distress and abnormal behavior. Such practices are inhumane and cruel, and it is unacceptable to subject innocent animals to such suffering.

Secondly, there are alternatives to animal testing that can provide reliable results without causing harm to animals. These alternatives include cell cultures, computer models, and human clinical trials. The use of these alternatives not only reduces animal suffering but also provides more accurate results as they are based on human biology, not animal physiology.

Finally, the use of animals in scientific research is morally questionable. Animals are sentient beings that feel pain, suffer, and have emotions. They deserve ethical consideration and should not be treated merely as objects for human benefit. It is our responsibility as humans to ensure that we do not cause unnecessary harm to animals, and using them in scientific research is certainly not a necessity.

In conclusion, the use of animals in scientific research should be prohibited due to the harm that it causes to animals, the availability of alternatives, and the moral considerations involved. While there is no denying the important role that animal testing has played in medical advancement, we must also recognize the ethical implications of such practices and strive to find alternatives that do not harm innocent animals.",1,0.9936293,1,True
E3DF63035440,"Winston Churchill famously said that ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts."" This is a profound statement that speaks to the importance of not letting failure stand in the way of achieving your ultimate success. Failure is a natural part of life; no one accomplishes their goals with initial success alone. It is by learning from our mistakes that we can become better and progress towards success. 

In particular, it is the courage to persist through the failures that will ultimately drive lasting success. Churchill serves as a powerful example of this idea, as his tenacity through his failures enabled him to ultimately become one of the greatest statesmen in history. He was able to persist through difficult times of failure and ultimately achieved great success because of his determination and courage to continue. 

In short, failures do not necessarily indicate a lack of success; rather, they should be viewed as an important stepping stone on the way to success. Through the courage to not give up in the face of failures, success can be achieved.",1,0.9944607,1,True
78E8970D0C13,"Sure, here's my essay on the potential benefits and risks of implementing an afterschool homework club:

As an 8th grader, I think it's super important to have an afterschool homework club at our school. I mean, think about it - homework can be really hard sometimes, and it's not always easy to focus on it at home. Like, my little brother keeps bugging me and wanting to play Fortnite, and my mom wants me to help her with dinner, so it's hard to get anything done. But if we had a homework club, I could go there and focus on my homework without any distractions. Plus, I could get help from my teachers and classmates if I need it.

But, there are also some risks to consider. Like, what if people don't show up to the homework club? Then it would be really boring and not worth it. And what if the teachers don't know how to help us with our homework? That could be really frustrating. And also, what if the club is during a time when we have other things we want to do, like sports or music practice? That could be really hard to balance.

I think the benefits of the homework club could be really cool, though. Like, if we have a place to go and focus on our homework, we could get it done faster and feel more confident about it. And if we can get help from our teachers and classmates, we could learn new things and understand the material better. Plus, it would be a great way to get some extra credit points, which is always a plus.

But, I think we need to make sure that the homework club is run really well. Like, the teachers need to be there to help us, and they need to make sure that everyone is on task and not getting distracted. And we need to make sure that the club is during a time that works for everyone, so that people can actually go.

Overall, I think an afterschool homework club could be really beneficial for students, teachers, and parents. It could help us get our homework done faster and better, and give us a place to go when we need help. But, we need to make sure that it's run well and",1,0.99417514,1,True

They are formed in a matter of seconds and can greatly influence our interactions with that person. While first impressions are important, they are not always accurate. In fact, they can be changed by considering a person's looks, personality, and communication skills.

When it comes to looks, first impressions can be misleading. We often make assumptions about a person's character based on their appearance, but these assumptions are not always accurate. For example, a person may be perceived as unintelligent or lazy based on their appearance, but this may not be the case. It is important to remember that appearances can be deceiving and that we should not judge a person solely based on their looks.

In addition to looks, a person's personality can also greatly influence our first impressions. We may assume that a person is outgoing or friendly based on their demeanor, but this may not always be the case. It is important to remember that people are complex individuals with unique personalities, and our first impressions may not accurately reflect their true character.

Communication skills are also an important factor in changing first impressions. A person may be perceived as unintelligent or uninteresting based on their communication skills, but this may not be the case. It is important to remember that communication is a two-way street and that we should strive to understand the other person's perspective. By actively listening and asking questions, we can gain a better understanding of a person and change our first impressions accordingly.

Dear Senator [Last Name],

As a high school student studying American government, I feel compelled to express my thoughts on the upcoming presidential election and the role of the Electoral College in determining the winner. As an individual, I believe that the Electoral College serves an important purpose in our democracy, and I am writing to urge you to support maintaining the Electoral College system.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures that presidential elections remain fair and representative across all states, regardless of each state's population. Without the Electoral College system, candidates would only campaign in highly populated states, ignoring the smaller states and their issues. In this way, the Electoral College promotes fairness, as it gives equal weight to each state's electoral votes, regardless of their population size.

Additionally, the Electoral College prevents the tyranny of the majority by requiring a candidate to win a broad majority of states to become president. It is a critical safeguard against a candidate winning the popular vote while ignoring the needs of smaller states or specific regions. This way, the system ensures that the winning candidate is representative of the entire country, not just a few states.

Furthermore, the current system ensures that the President-elect has won a clear mandate to govern. If the President-elect had only won the popular vote by a small percentage, as has happened in the past, they would not be able to govern effectively, as they would not have a clear mandate from the voters.

In conclusion, the Electoral College serves many important purposes that cannot be overlooked. It promotes fairness, prevents the tyranny of the majority, and ensures that the President-elect has won a mandate to govern effectively. I urge you, therefore, to support maintaining this system.

For this essay, I will be discussing five topics that are relevant to my community and society. These topics are: Minister Winston's contributions, the advantages and disadvantages of working in a group, the benefits of immigrants coming to a new country, the challenges of learning a new language, everyday activities that can help with language learning, and the positive contributions of programs and teachers towards helping immigrants.

Firstly, Minister Winston is a prominent figure in my community who helps others in various ways. He volunteers his time and resources to help those in need, including providing food and shelter to the homeless, advocating for social justice, and supporting local businesses. His contributions have made a significant impact on our community, and his dedication to helping others is truly inspiring.

Moving on to the second topic, working in a group has its advantages and disadvantages. Working in a group can be beneficial because it allows for collaboration, the sharing of ideas, and the opportunity to learn from others. However, it can also be challenging because it can be difficult to communicate effectively and agree on a common goal.

The third topic is the benefits of immigrants coming to a new country. Immigrants bring with them new ideas, cultures, and perspectives that can enrich our society. They also contribute to the economy by filling labor gaps and creating new businesses. Furthermore, immigrants often face challenges in adapting to a new culture, which can lead to innovation and creativity.

Learning a new language can be challenging, but it can also be rewarding. Learning a new language can improve cognitive function, enhance cultural understanding, and increase job opportunities. However, it can also be time-consuming and require a lot of effort and dedication.

Everyday activities such as listening to music, watching movies, and reading books can help with language learning. These activities expose individuals to new vocabulary, grammar, and cultural references, which can aid in language acquisition.

Finally, programs and teachers play a crucial role in helping immigrants adapt to a new culture and language. These programs provide language classes, cultural immersion experiences, and support services to help immigrants navigate their new environment. Teachers, in particular, can be invaluable resources for immigrants, as they can provide guidance and support in language learning and cultural assimilation.

Introduction

Makeup artistry is a growing field that has gained popularity in recent years. It is a creative and artistic profession that involves applying makeup to enhance and transform an individual's appearance. As an eighth-grade student, I believe that offering makeup artistry courses in our school would be a valuable addition to our curriculum. In this essay, I will discuss the benefits of a partnership with local companies that would allow students to explore being a makeup artist, how taking these courses can improve personal social health, and provide examples of how these courses can help people to learn how to take care of their hair, do their makeup, and dress appropriately.

Partnership with Local Companies

Partnering with local companies would provide students with valuable opportunities to learn about the makeup industry and gain practical experience. Local companies would provide students with the opportunity to work with professional makeup artists and learn about the latest makeup trends and techniques. Additionally, local companies would provide students with the opportunity to network with other makeup artists and potentially gain employment in the industry.

Improving Personal Social Health

Taking makeup artistry courses can have a positive impact on personal social health. Makeup artistry is a form of self-expression and can boost self-esteem and confidence. By learning how to apply makeup, individuals can enhance their natural features and feel more comfortable in their own skin. Additionally, makeup artistry can be a form of stress relief and can help individuals relax and unwind.

Examples of How Courses Can Help

d0d1a577,"Limiting car usage can have several advantages for both individuals and the environment. This trend is becoming more popular around the world, as exemplified by Vauban, a car-free suburb in Germany, and car-free days in cities like Paris and Bogota. By reducing car usage, we can address issues such as greenhouse gas emissions and promote alternative modes of transportation.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars contribute significantly to these emissions, especially in car-intensive areas. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, while in some areas of the United States, this percentage can go up to 50 percent. By limiting car usage, we can greatly reduce these emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change.

Another advantage of reducing car usage is the promotion of alternative transportation modes. In the car-free suburb of Vauban, for example, residents rely on public transportation, biking, and walking to get around. This not only reduces the dependence on cars but also promotes a healthier and more active lifestyle. In cities like Paris and Bogota, car-free days have encouraged people to explore other means of transportation such as buses, taxis, biking, and walking. This not only reduces traffic congestion but also improves air quality and reduces noise pollution.

Additionally, limiting car usage can create more compact and accessible communities. In Vauban, stores are placed within walking distance on a main street, rather than being located in distant malls. This encourages people to walk or bike to their daily needs instead of relying on cars. Similarly, the car-free days in cities like Bogota promote a sense of community and social interaction, as people participate in alternative modes of transportation together.

The trend towards limiting car usage is not only limited to developed countries but is also gaining momentum in developing nations. In countries like Colombia, car-free days are becoming more popular and are spreading to other cities. This shows that reducing car usage is not just a localized solution but a global movement towards sustainable and livable cities.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for individuals and the environment. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting alternative modes of transportation, and creating more accessible communities, we can contribute to a more sustainable and healthier future. As more cities and communities around the world adopt car-free initiatives, it is clear that this trend is here to stay.",1,0.9925317,1,True

In this essay, I will compare and contrast the benefits and challenges of working in a group versus working alone.

Working in a group can have many benefits. For example, it can provide a sense of community and belonging. When working with others, you can share ideas, learn from each other, and build relationships. This can be especially beneficial in a school or workplace setting, where you may be working with people from different backgrounds and with different skills and experiences. Additionally, working in a group can help you to develop important communication and leadership skills. When you work with others, you must be able to clearly communicate your ideas and work collaboratively with others to achieve a common goal.

However, working in a group can also have its challenges. For example, it can be difficult to manage different personalities and work styles. When working with a group, you must be able to work effectively with people who have different ideas and approaches to problem-solving. This can be challenging, especially if you have strong opinions or if you are not used to working with others. Additionally, working in a group can be time-consuming, as you must spend time discussing and agreeing on decisions.

On the other hand, working alone can have its own set of benefits. For example, it can provide a sense of control and independence. When working alone, you can work at your own pace and make decisions based on your own preferences. This can be especially beneficial in a school or workplace setting, where you may have a lot of freedom to choose how you work. Additionally, working alone can be more efficient, as you do not have to spend time discussing decisions with others.

However, working alone can also have its challenges. For example, it can be isolating and lonely. When working alone, you may miss the social interaction and support that comes from working with others. Additionally, working alone can be less efficient, as you may not have access to the same resources and support as you would when working with others.

While the use of cellphones in the classroom can be beneficial, it can also have potential issues that need to be addressed. In this essay, I will investigate the different ways cellphones can be used in the classroom for learning purposes, consider the current use of technology in schools, and discuss the potential issues with allowing cellphones in the classroom. Additionally, I will research and discuss how cellphones can be used in case of family emergencies.

One of the most common ways that cellphones are used in the classroom is for research purposes. Students can use their cellphones to access the internet and gather information for projects and assignments. This can be especially useful for students who do not have access to a computer at home. Additionally, cellphones can be used for collaboration and communication purposes, allowing students to work together with their classmates and teachers even outside of the classroom.

However, the use of cellphones in the classroom can also have potential issues. For example, students may be distracted by social media or other apps on their phones, which can negatively impact their learning. Additionally, cellphones can be a source of cheating and academic dishonesty, as students can use their phones to access information or communicate with others during exams.

To address these potential issues, schools can implement preventive measures. For example, teachers can establish clear guidelines for the use of cellphones in the classroom, including when and where they can be used. Additionally, schools can provide students with access to computers or other technology in the classroom to ensure that they have the resources they need to learn.

In case of family emergencies, cellphones can be a valuable tool for communication and coordination. For example, students can use their cellphones to contact their families and let them know that they are safe. Additionally, cellphones can be used to coordinate relief efforts and provide information about emergency situations.

In conclusion, cellphones can be a valuable tool for learning in the classroom, but they can also have potential issues that need to be addressed.

While attending school in person has its benefits, there are also many advantages to being home schooled. In this essay, I will explore the benefits and drawbacks of students being able to attend school from home, including how it affects attendance, responsibility, and job preparation.

One of the main benefits of attending school from home is that it allows students to have more flexibility in their schedules. This is particularly beneficial for students who have other commitments, such as sports or extracurricular activities. For example, if a student is a talented athlete, they may be able to attend school from home and still have ample time to practice and compete in their sport. This flexibility can also be beneficial for students who have family obligations, such as caring for younger siblings.

Another benefit of attending school from home is that it can foster a greater sense of responsibility in students. When students are responsible for their own education, they must take a more active role in their learning. This can help them develop important skills such as time management, self-discipline, and problem-solving. Additionally, when students are home schooled, they often have more one-on-one time with their teachers, which can help them develop a stronger relationship with their educator and receive more personalized attention.

However, there are also some drawbacks to attending school from home. One of the main concerns is that students may not have the same level of social interaction as they would in a traditional classroom setting. This can be particularly problematic for students who are new to a school or community, as they may struggle to make friends and form meaningful relationships with their peers. Additionally, some students may miss the structure and routine of a traditional school setting, which can make it difficult for them to stay on track with their studies.

Another potential drawback of attending school from home is that it may not provide the same level of job preparation as a traditional school setting. While home schooling can be tailored to a student's individual needs and interests, it may not provide the same level of exposure to a diverse range of subjects and extracurricular activities that a traditional school setting offers.

Additionally, it could offer a structure that encourages scholastic success, since those students who are motivated to achieve higher grades would be rewarded with chances to participate in school activities. 

For teachers, this policy could mean lower stress levels and a more productive learning environment. Not only would the teacher be able to focus on quality instruction rather than attempting to encourage a struggling student, but the other students would also be more engaged in their learning, encouraged by the absence of any disruption caused by a student with below-average grades.

One of the most positive impacts of technology is the fact that it facilitates easier and faster communication between people. In the past, the way to find out information about someone or something was to do research; however today, we can find out almost anything we want to know quickly and even communicate with people regardless of distance. In addition, even mundane tasks such as online banking, grocery shopping, and paying bills can be done quickly and efficiently without ever having to leave the house.

I am writing to propose an exciting and educational field trip to your location for my classmates and me. Our teacher, [Your Teacher's Name], has been emphasizing the importance of education and its consequences, and I believe a visit to your restaurant would be the perfect way to illustrate these points.

As you may know, many students in our school and around the country struggle with the consequences of not receiving an education. Without a proper education, they may find themselves in difficult financial situations, struggling to find good jobs and provide for themselves and their families. By bringing us to your location, we can see firsthand the potential consequences of not taking our education seriously.

During the field trip, we could learn about the different roles and responsibilities within a McDonalds restaurant, such as cooking, management, and customer service. We could also learn about the importance of teamwork, communication, and time management in a fast-paced environment like a restaurant. These are valuable skills that can be applied to any career path, and I believe a visit to your location would help drive these points home.

Furthermore, a visit to McDonalds would also give us an opportunity to see the impact of fast food on our health and well-being. We could learn about the nutritional value of different menu items and the consequences of consuming unhealthy food on a regular basis. This would be a great way to reinforce the lessons we have been learning in health class about the importance of a balanced diet and the consequences of poor food choices.

I understand that hosting a field trip to a McDonalds location may not be possible for your company, but I hope you can see the potential benefits of such an excursion. By providing us with a real-world example of the consequences of not receiving an education, I believe we could have a more meaningful and memorable learning experience.

Thank you for considering my proposal. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]",1,0.9924845,1,True
B7938A92A4F9,"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that having an effective strategy before working hard is crucial to achieving success. While working hard is important, it is not enough to ensure success. It is essential to plan and consider different opinions before starting any project or task.

One of the primary reasons why it is important to have a strategy is that it helps to identify potential obstacles and challenges that may arise during the process. By identifying these obstacles, one can prepare for them and develop a plan to overcome them. For example, if a student is working on a group project, they can identify potential communication barriers and develop strategies to address them.

Moreover, having a strategy helps to prioritize tasks and allocate resources effectively. It allows individuals to focus on the most critical tasks and avoid wasting time on less important ones. For instance, if a student is preparing for a test, they can prioritize the most important topics and allocate time accordingly.

Furthermore, having a strategy helps to stay organized and avoid procrastination. By breaking down a project into smaller tasks and setting deadlines, individuals can stay on track and avoid getting overwhelmed. Additionally, having a plan helps to stay motivated and focused on the end goal.

However, it is not enough to have a strategy; it is also important to consider different opinions and perspectives. It is essential to listen to others and take their input into account. By doing so, one can gain valuable insights and improve their strategy. For example, if a student is working on a group project, they can listen to their group members' ideas and incorporate them into the project.

In conclusion, having an effective strategy before working hard is crucial to achieving success. It helps to identify potential obstacles, prioritize tasks, stay organized, and avoid procrastination. Furthermore, it is important to consider different opinions and perspectives to gain valuable insights and improve the strategy. By following these steps, individuals can increase their chances of success and achieve their goals.",1,0.9948384,1,True

7D94F809823A,"As technology continues to advance, it has become an integral part of our daily lives. From smartphones to computers, the internet has revolutionized the way we live, work, and communicate. However, as with any advancement, there are potential risks and consequences associated with technology. In this essay, I will explore the impact of technology on physical and mental health, the effects of technology on communication in relationships, the benefits of interacting in person compared to using technology to purchase items, and the consequences of relying too heavily on technology instead of face-to-face interaction.

Firstly, research has shown that technology can have both positive and negative effects on physical and mental health. On the one hand, technology can be a valuable tool for tracking and managing health information, such as fitness and nutrition. On the other hand, excessive use of technology can lead to sedentary behavior, poor posture, and eye strain, which can negatively impact physical health. Additionally, technology can also contribute to mental health issues such as anxiety and depression, as it can create feelings of isolation and disconnection from others.

Secondly, technology has had a significant impact on communication in relationships. While technology has made it easier for people to stay connected with friends and family across the globe, it has also led to a decline in face-to-face communication. This decline can lead to misunderstandings and misinterpretations, as nonverbal cues such as body language and tone of voice are not present in digital communication. Additionally, technology can also create a false sense of intimacy, as people may feel more connected to others online than they actually are in person.

Thirdly, interacting in person has numerous benefits compared to using technology to purchase items. For example, shopping in person allows for a more tactile experience, as customers can see, touch, and try on products before making a purchase. Additionally, shopping in person can also provide an opportunity for social interaction, as customers may interact with store employees and other shoppers. This social interaction can help to combat feelings of isolation and loneliness that can be associated with excessive use of technology.

Finally, relying too heavily on technology can have serious consequences for our well-being. As technology becomes increasingly integrated into our lives, it can lead to a decline in face-to-face interaction and a loss of interpersonal skills. Additionally, technology can also contribute to a sense of",1,0.99378705,1,True
7f14b2a5,"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. The passages provided highlight some of these advantages, including a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, and increased access to alternative transportation options.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the impact it has on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. As stated in the passages, passenger cars are responsible for a significant percentage of greenhouse gas emissions in both Europe and the United States. By limiting car usage, especially in suburban areas where car dependency is high, it is possible to reduce these emissions and mitigate the negative effects of climate change. This is particularly important as efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions become more urgent on a global scale.

In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, limiting car usage can also improve air quality. The passage about Paris enforcing a partial driving ban due to smog illustrates the detrimental effects of car emissions on the environment. The ban resulted in a significant reduction in congestion and smog levels. By limiting car usage and encouraging alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, or public transit, cities can not only improve air quality but also create healthier and more sustainable environments for their residents.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the increased accessibility to alternative transportation options. The passage about Vauban, Germany, showcases a community that has embraced a car-free lifestyle. In this community, residents have access to a tram system and convenient walking and biking infrastructure. By designing communities in a way that prioritizes public transportation and pedestrian-friendly spaces, it becomes easier for residents to rely less on cars and utilize other forms of transportation. This not only reduces traffic congestion but also promotes a more active and healthier lifestyle.

Moreover, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. The passage about Bogota, Colombia, highlights the success of a car-free day initiative in reducing traffic congestion and promoting alternative forms of transportation. By reducing the number of cars on the road, cities can save on infrastructure costs associated with building and maintaining roads and parking facilities. Additionally, car-free initiatives can boost local economies by promoting the use of public transit, walking, and biking, which in turn supports local businesses and reduces the reliance on car-centric industries.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for individuals and society as a whole. It can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, increase access to alternative transportation options, and have economic benefits. As the passages demonstrate, this approach is being embraced in various parts of the world and can contribute to creating healthier, more sustainable, and livable communities. By prioritizing alternative transportation and designing communities with less emphasis on car dependency, individuals and society can reap the benefits of limiting car usage.",1,0.9931618,1,True
F49521C3494B,"As an 8th grader, I believe that pairing older and younger students in programs is a great way to help both groups. While there are certainly benefits to this type of program, there are also some drawbacks that must be considered. However, in my opinion, the benefits of these programs far outweigh the drawbacks.

One of the biggest benefits of these programs is the opportunity for older students to mentor younger ones. This can be a valuable experience for both groups. Older students can gain leadership skills and confidence by taking on a role of responsibility. They can also learn how to communicate effectively and how to handle difficult situations. Younger students, on the other hand, can benefit from the guidance and support of an older student. They can learn new skills and gain a different perspective on life.

Another benefit of these programs is that they can help to break down the barriers between different age groups. When older and younger students work together, they can learn to understand and appreciate each other's differences. This can help to create a more inclusive and supportive environment in the school.

However, there are also some drawbacks to these programs. One potential drawback is that older students may feel like they are being treated like babysitters. They may not feel respected or valued for their own contributions. Additionally, younger students may feel like they are being left behind or not given the same opportunities as their older peers.

Despite these potential drawbacks, I believe that schools with programs that pair older and younger students can help students in many ways. For example, a school may have a program where older students mentor younger students in science. This can help to ensure that younger students are getting the support and guidance they need to succeed in this subject. Additionally, a school may have a program where younger students mentor older students in a foreign language. This can help to ensure that older students are able to learn the language and communicate effectively with their peers.

In conclusion, I believe that programs that pair older and younger students are a valuable tool for schools. While there are certainly benefits and drawbacks to these programs, I believe that the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. By providing opportunities for older students to mentor younger ones and by breaking down the barriers between different age groups, these programs can help to create a more inclusive and supportive environment in the school.",1,0.9944622,1,True

Hey there! So, you know how sometimes you just want to get out of the house and do something fun? Like, something that's not just sitting on your couch binge-watching Netflix? Yeah, me too! And you know what's great for that? Parks! Like, they're basically nature's playgrounds. And I'm not just talking about any old park, I'm talking about the good stuff. The kind with swings and slides and stuff.

First of all, let's talk about the swings. Swings are like, the best. You get to sit in a nice, comfy seat and just swing back and forth. It's like a mini-vacation from the stress of school and stuff. And you can even bring a book or your phone and just chill while you're swinging. It's like, the perfect way to relax. Plus, it's a great way to get some exercise in. Like, you know how you're supposed to get at least an hour of physical activity a day? Well, swinging is like, the easiest way to do that. It's like, no sweat, no effort. Just you, the wind, and the sunshine.

And then there are the slides. Oh man, the slides. They're like, the best part of the park. You get to go down this big, slippery slide and feel like a kid again. It's like, the ultimate rush. And you can even race your friends and see who can go down the fastest. It's like, so much fun. And it's not just for kids either! Like, adults can play too. It's like, a great way to get some exercise and have some fun.

But slides aren't the only thing parks have to offer. There are also picnic areas and trails and stuff. Like, you can pack a lunch and have a picnic with your family or friends.

Hey, guys! So, we all know how hard it can be to make decisions sometimes.

Or what if you're trying to decide what to wear to school, but you can't decide between your favorite t-shirt and that one pair of pants that you know your mom likes? It's super frustrating, right?

Well, I recently did some research on how to become more decisive, and I found some pretty cool methods that I want to share with you guys. First, you can try something called the ""Pros and Cons List."" It's like, you write down all the pros and cons of each option, and then you can see which one is the best choice. It's like, if you're trying to decide between two restaurants, you can write down all the things you like about each one, and then compare them. It's pretty easy!

Another thing you can try is called ""Prioritizing."" It's like, you make a list of all the things that are important to you, and then you can see which option is the most important. So, if you're trying to decide between two video games, you can make a list of all the things you like about each one, and then see which one has the most things on your list. It's pretty cool!

I also found out about something called ""Decision Mapping."" It's like, you make a map of all the different options, and then you can see how they connect to each other. So, if you're trying to decide between two different college majors, you can make a map of all the different classes you'll have to take, and then see how they connect to each other. It's pretty helpful!

I tried out all of these methods, and you know what? They actually worked! I was able to make some really tough decisions, and I felt so much better afterward. Like, I was able to decide which game to play with my friends, and I even got to wear my favorite t-shirt to school. It was great!

CCB5EED97986,"Attitude is a crucial aspect of a person's life. It is the way a person thinks and feels about something or someone, and it can greatly impact their life. In this essay, I will research how attitude can help people's lives, reflect on moments in my life that demonstrate the impact of attitude, analyze my current attitude and consider how I could improve it, examine how my siblings or relatives have affected my attitude, look into how different people react to situations and how their attitudes impact the outcome, and describe how an individual's attitude could help them achieve their goals.

Firstly, research shows that having a positive attitude can greatly improve a person's life. A positive attitude can help a person cope with stress and adversity, improve their mental and physical health, and even increase their lifespan. For example, a study conducted by the Mayo Clinic found that people with a positive attitude were more likely to engage in healthy behaviors such as exercising and eating a healthy diet, which can lead to a longer and healthier life.

In my own life, I have experienced the impact of attitude firsthand. There have been times when I had a negative attitude towards a situation or person, and it only made things worse. On the other hand, there have been times when I had a positive attitude, and it made the situation or person more enjoyable and productive. For example, when I was struggling with a difficult project in school, I initially had a negative attitude towards it. However, after talking to a friend who had a positive attitude about the project, I began to see it in a different light. I started to enjoy the challenge and put in more effort, which ultimately led to a better outcome.

In addition to my own experiences, I have also seen how my siblings' attitudes have affected me. My younger sister, for example, always has a positive attitude, even in the face of adversity. Her optimism and resilience have inspired me to see things in a more positive light, even when things are tough. On the other hand, my older brother has a more negative attitude towards certain situations, which can sometimes bring me down and make me feel discouraged.

Furthermore, I have also noticed how different people react to situations and how their attitudes impact the outcome. For example, when I was part of a group project in school, I noticed that the person with the most negative attitude",1,0.99453133,1,True
B2B6C25D967A,"Attitude is a powerful indicator of success. Many successful people adopt a positive attitude to maximize their opportunities and reach their goals. For example, Marianne Williamson, a renowned author and teacher, believes that the most crucial ingredient for success is a positive attitude. She asserts that attaining a successful life is more about attitude than aptitude, and encourages people to live every moment with positivity and gratitude. 

Other successful people, such as NBA star Dwyane Wade, have proven that a positive attitude is necessary for true success. As a player for the Miami Heat, Wade refused to give in to adversity and continually sought to remain positive in order to lead the team to victory. Among the greatest talents, a positive attitude is essential for great successes.

A positive attitude can help individuals become successful by teaching them to focus on their goals, leading them to find creative solutions to problems, and helping them stay motivated. It is important to remember that success is not a destination, but a journey. With the right attitude, success can be achieved despite the obstacles. Therefore, attitude should always be considered an essential part of the success equation, and people should strive to remain positive in all situations.",1,0.9940812,1,True
llama_70b_v1119,"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. This can be really helpfull because it allows them to get different perspectives on the situation. For example, if someone is trying to decide weather or not to get a dog, they might talk to their friends who have dogs and their friends who don't have dogs. The friends who have dogs might tell them about all the fun things they can do with their dog, like going for walks and playing fetch. But the friends who don't have dogs might remind them about how much work it is to take care of a dog and how much money it costs.

By talking to both groups of friends, the person can get a more well-rounded understanding of what it's like to have a dog. They can also see the pros and cons of having a dog and make a more informed desicion.

Another reason why seeking multiple opinions can be helpfull is that it can help people avoid bias. If someone only talks to one person about their problem, they might only hear one side of the story. But if they talk to multiple people, they can get a more balanced view of the situation. For example, if someone is trying to decide weather or not to take a certain job offer, they might talk to their parents who think the job is a great oppertunity, but also talk to their friends who are worried about the long hours and low pay.

Overall, seeking multiple opinions can be a really good way to make a better choice. It allows people to get different perspectives, avoid bias, and make a more informed desicion.

Okay, so we've all heard the quote from John Lubbock before: ""Your character will be what you choose to make it."" At first, it might seem like a no-brainer, but let's really think about what it means. It's not just about being nice or doing the right thing, it's about creating your own personality.

Being able to create your own personality means being unique and different from everyone else. It's like, why be a cookie-cutter version of someone else when you can be yourself?! You can have your own interests, your own sense of humor, and your own way of doing things. It's like, why not embrace who you are and make the most of it?!

Being unique is what makes you stand out and catches people's attention. It's like, why be a faceless person when you can be a one-of-a-kind individual?!

But here's the thing, having your own personality isn't just about being different, it's also about being respected. When you have your own identity and don't try to be someone you're not, people are more likely to respect you for it. They'll be like, ""Wow, this person is confident and knows who they are."" It's like, you're not trying to impress anyone by being someone else, you're just being yourself, and that's way cooler.

So, in conclusion, creating your own personality is super important. It's not just about being different, it's about being respected and appreciated for who you are. Don't be afraid to be yourself, embrace it, and make the most of it! 😎",1,0.9936985,1,True

For example, mobile health technology can enable doctors to provide remote care and advice to people, even from a distance. Mobile health devices, such as wearable technology, can allow doctors to monitor patient activity and receive real-time data on patient health, which can provide valuable insight into the patient's overall health status. Additionally, telehealth programs can provide people with routine care and diagnoses to manage chronic conditions. By utilizing these tools, people can have access to quality health care, even if they can't visit a doctor in person.

Another way that technology can improve people's lives is through improved accessibility. Advanced assistive technologies, such as voice recognition software, can enable people with physical limitations to communicate more efficiently, while computer-aided reading programs can provide an opportunity to gain knowledge without the need to physically visit a library. This technology can create a stronger sense of physical and social freedom for people with disabilities that would otherwise be unable to receive an education or work in many industries.

Finally, communication technology can help create connections with family, friends, and strangers around the world, regardless of physical distance. Through social media, people can communicate and share experiences without the need to physically meet someone. Additionally, communication technology can benefit people in emergency situations and provide better medical response times. For instance, through connected medical devices, people can receive tailored medical care, including remote health monitoring and early diagnosis of health concerns.

DF1D43973CFA,"As the debate over school schedules continues to be an ongoing issue, an innovative idea has been proposed: reduce the number of school days from five to four, and increase the length of each day to two extra hours. While this idea has drawn both support and criticism, there are many valid arguments in favor of the four-day school week with two extra hours of school each day. 

First, a four-day school week would reduce stress by allowing students, teachers and staff more time to socialize, participate in extra-curricular activities, or pursue hobbies. The extra two hours per day would also allow teachers to dig deeper into their subjects and help students stay engaged and focused. Furthermore, a four-day school week would provide an economic benefit, as schools would need fewer personnel to clean and maintain the buildings. Plus, this would give families a bit of a break when it comes to childcare responsibilities, as they could use those days to plan activities, run errands, or simply get some much-needed rest. 

Ultimately, a four-day school week with two extra hours of school each day would be beneficial for everyone involved. Students would have fewer days to feel anxious and overwhelmed, while still having the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of the subjects they are studying. Additionally, the cost savings for schools would be a welcome bonus.

llama_70b_v185,"I think that distance learning is a good idear for school because it allows students to learn from home. This is good for students who live far away from school or who have a sickness that makes it hard for them to come to school every day. It also helps students who need to take care of their family members.

For example, my friend Sarah lives in a small town that is 2 hours away from our school. She has to wake up at 5 am every day to catch the bus and get to school on time. With distance learning, she can just log in to her computer at home and join the class online. She can also save money on transportation and use that money for other things like college applications.

Another reason distance learning is good is that it allows students to learn at their own pace. Some students might learn faster than others, and with distance learning, they can go ahead and finish their work quickly. They can also go back and review the material whenever they want.

Furthermore, distance learning can also help students who have anxiety or other mental health issues. Some students might feel uncomfortable in a classroom setting, and distance learning can provide them with a safe and comfortable learning environment.

However, I also think that distance learning is not a good idea for all students. Some students might get distracted at home and not pay attention to their work. They might also miss out on the social interactions and face-to-face communication with their teachers and classmates.

In conclusion, I believe that distance learning is a good option for students who need it, but it should not replace traditional classroom learning entirely. Schools should offer both options and let students choose what works best for them.

Firstly, extended periods of summer break provide students with an opportunity to recharge and refresh their minds. After a long academic year, students can take a break from their studies and engage in activities that they enjoy. This break can be spent with family, friends, or pursuing hobbies and interests. By taking a break, students can reduce their stress levels and improve their overall mental health.

Secondly, short breaks for the other seasons can also have a similar effect. For example, during the winter months, students can take a break from their studies to spend time with family and friends, or engage in winter activities such as skiing or snowboarding. During the spring, students can take a break to enjoy outdoor activities such as hiking or biking. These short breaks can provide students with a much-needed break from their studies and help them recharge for the upcoming academic year.

Moreover, extended periods of summer break and short breaks for the other seasons can also provide students with an opportunity to catch up on their studies. During the summer months, students can take advantage of the extra time to review their coursework and prepare for the upcoming academic year. Similarly, during the other seasons, students can use their break time to catch up on any missed assignments or study for upcoming exams.

Finally, having extended periods of summer break and short breaks for the other seasons can also help students develop important life skills. For example, during the summer months, students can take on internships or part-time jobs to gain work experience and develop their resume. During the other seasons, students can take on leadership roles in extracurricular activities or volunteer work to develop their leadership skills.

In conclusion, I believe that having extended periods of summer break and short breaks for the other seasons has numerous benefits for students. These breaks provide students with an opportunity to recharge and refresh their minds, catch up on their studies, develop important life skills, and reduce their stress levels.

This movement is gaining traction in various parts of the world and comes with numerous advantages. By limiting car usage, we can not only reduce our carbon footprint but also improve the overall quality of life in our communities.

One example of a community that has successfully limited car usage is Vauban, Germany. In Vauban, street parking, driveways, and home garages are generally forbidden, except for a few streets and large garages at the edge of the development. As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move there. This has led to happier residents, less pollution, and a more peaceful and bike-friendly neighborhood. The success of Vauban has inspired similar initiatives in Europe, the United States, and other parts of the world.

Reducing car usage is crucial for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage, we can make a significant impact on reducing these emissions. This is especially important as we work towards meeting ambitious goals to curb greenhouse gas emissions, such as those set by President Obama.

Limiting car usage also has positive implications for our environment. Transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can help decrease air pollution and improve air quality. This is especially important in cities like Paris, where smog reaches dangerous levels. Paris recently enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air, and congestion was reduced by 60 percent. Similar initiatives, such as car-free days, have been successful in cities like Bogota, Colombia, where millions of people hiked, biked, or took buses to work. These car-free initiatives not only reduce emissions but also promote alternative transportation and create a sense of community.

By limiting car usage, we can also improve the overall quality of life in our communities. In Vauban, residents have experienced less stress and greater happiness since giving up their cars. In addition, limiting car usage allows for smarter urban planning. Instead of sprawling suburbs and distant malls that rely heavily on cars, communities can be designed with stores placed a walk away, accessible public transportation, and less space for parking. This makes it easier to run errands, encourages physical activity, and reduces traffic congestion. Furthermore, limiting car usage can help revitalize city centers and make suburbs more compact and accessible. This has been seen in Bogota, where the construction of bicycle paths, parks, and sports centers, along with rush-hour restrictions, has transformed the city for the better.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has many advantages. It can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and enhance the overall quality of life in our communities. Initiatives like car-free days, car-reduced communities, and smart urban planning are gaining momentum around the world. As more people become aware of the benefits and take action to limit car usage, we can create a more sustainable and livable future.",1,0.9913652,1,True
B4B2CB4AA07F,"The School Board's plan to add one and a half hours to the school day is a controversial issue that has sparked both positive and negative reactions from students, parents, and teachers. While some argue that the additional time will provide students with more opportunities for learning and academic success, others argue that it will negatively impact student-teacher relationships, student activities, and students' health. In this essay, I will analyze the potential advantages and disadvantages of the School Board's plan and consider how it could affect different stakeholders.

One of the potential advantages of the School Board's plan is that it could provide students with more time for learning and academic success. With an additional hour and a half, students would have more time to complete assignments, review material, and ask questions. This could lead to improved grades, test scores, and overall academic performance. Additionally, the extra time could allow for more personalized instruction and support for students who may need it.

However, the addition of extra time to the school day could also have negative consequences. One potential disadvantage is that it could negatively impact student-teacher relationships. With more time in the school day, teachers may feel pressured to cover more material, which could lead to less time for building meaningful connections with their students. This could result in a more transactional relationship between teachers and students, rather than a more collaborative and supportive one.

Another potential disadvantage is that the extra time could negatively impact student activities. With more time in the school day, students may feel overwhelmed by the amount of work they need to complete. This could lead to a decrease in participation in extracurricular activities, such as sports, music, or clubs. These activities are important for students' social and emotional development, and a decrease in participation could have long-term negative effects.

Parents may also be negatively impacted by the School Board's plan. With an additional hour and a half, students would be in school longer, which could make it more difficult for parents to pick up their children. This could lead to increased stress and anxiety for both parents and students, as they may feel separated for longer periods of time.

Finally, students' health could also be negatively impacted by the School Board's plan. With more time in the school day, students may be more likely to sit for extended periods of time, which",1,0.99341595,1,True
D03AC4A82463,"When it comes to having someone attempt to make drastic changes to our personalities, it can be a difficult and often confusing topic. On one hand, it can be helpful to learn from others how to be more understanding, or to appreciate a different perspective. On the other hand, if someone is trying to pressure us to be something we are not, it can bring about negative consequences.

It is important for all of us to remember that we all bring something unique to the table. We should not feel ashamed to express our individual views and experiences in a respectful manner. Furthermore, we should try to accept the differences between us, whether we agree or not, to foster healthy relationships. 

At the same time, being open to constructive criticism is beneficial. We all have areas in our lives we could work on or need guidance; a person who offers feedback or suggestions in a kind and patient manner should be seen as an ally. Attempting to better ourselves should be appreciated, though we should be wary of someone wanting us to change just so they are comfortable. 

Ultimately, it is best to strive for a balance between embracing new insights while also preserving our core identity. We need to be accountable for how we conduct ourselves but not necessarily cave into the demands of another person.",1,0.9945083,1,True
llama_70b_v1361,"I think it's really cool that some schools are trying out meditation and mindfulness practices. It's like, super important for kids to learn how to relax and focus, you know? But, I'm not sure if it should be a part of the school day.

One reason I think it's a good idea is because it can help kids feel more calm and focused. Like, if you're feeling really stressed out, it can be hard to learn and pay attention. But, if you do some meditation, it can help you feel more relaxed and focused, so you can do better in school. My friend's mom is a teacher and she uses meditation in her classroom and she says it really helps the kids.

But, there are also some reasons why it might not be a good idea. For example, some kids might feel weird or uncomfortable doing meditation. Like, they might feel like they're being forced to do something that's not cool or that they don't understand. It's like, it's not for everyone, you know? And, some kids might not have the attention span to sit still and be quiet for a long time. They might get bored or restless and it could be a distraction.

Another thing to think about is that there are already a lot of things that kids have to do in school. Like, we have to learn a lot of stuff and do a lot of work. Adding meditation and mindfulness practices might make the day too long or too busy. It's like, we already have a lot on our plates, you know?

I think it's important to have some downtime and relaxation in the school day, but maybe there are other ways to do it that wouldn't take up too much time or make kids feel uncomfortable. Like, maybe we could have a little bit of recess or playtime outside. That way, we can still have some fun and get some exercise while also having some time to relax and unwind.

So, I'm not sure if meditation and mindfulness practices should be a part of the school day. It's like, it's a good idea in theory, but there are also some things to think about. Maybe we can find a way to make it work, but also make sure that kids are comfortable and not feeling like they're being forced to do something they don't want to do.",1,0.99479914,1,True
DA228B928B61,"In recent years, the COVID-19 pandemic has forced many schools to switch to online learning, and this has led to a debate about the pros and cons of taking classes from home. While some people argue that online learning is better than traditional classroom learning, others believe that it has its drawbacks. In this essay, I will discuss both sides of the argument and provide my own perspective on the matter.

One of the main advantages of taking classes from home is the flexibility it provides. Students can learn at their own pace and on their own schedule, which can be especially beneficial for those who have other commitments, such as jobs or family responsibilities. Additionally, online classes often allow students to access course materials and lectures at any time, which can make it easier to fit learning into busy schedules.

Another advantage of online learning is that it can be more convenient for students who live in remote areas. Without the need to commute to a physical campus, students can save time and money on transportation, and they can also access courses that may not be available in their local area.

However, there are also some disadvantages to taking classes from home. One of the main drawbacks is the lack of social interaction that can come with online learning. In a traditional classroom, students have the opportunity to interact with their peers and teachers on a regular basis, which can help them build relationships and learn from each other. Without this interaction, students may feel isolated and disconnected from their classmates.

Another disadvantage of online learning is that it can be more difficult to stay motivated. Without the structure of a traditional classroom, students may struggle to stay on track with their coursework and may be more likely to procrastinate. Additionally, the lack of face-to-face interaction with teachers can make it more challenging to get help and support when needed.

In my opinion, taking classes from home has both its advantages and disadvantages. While the flexibility and convenience can be beneficial, the lack of social interaction and motivation can be a challenge. Ultimately, the decision to take classes from home should be based on an individual's specific needs and circumstances. For some students, the benefits may outweigh the drawbacks, while for others, the opposite may be true.

In conclusion, the debate about the pros and cons of taking classes from home is a complex one. While online learning can provide flexibility",1,0.993401,1,True
E55289EA6492,"Growth is a fundamental aspect of life, as it allows individuals to develop and evolve into their full potential. However, the pursuit of growth can sometimes be hindered by the desire for more. Being avaricious, or excessively desiring wealth and material possessions, can lead to a narrow focus on personal gain, rather than on personal growth.

On one hand, the desire for more can drive individuals to push themselves to achieve their goals and reach their full potential. This drive can lead to innovation, progress, and success in various areas of life. For example, a person who is driven to succeed in their career may work hard to advance in their field, leading to recognition and success.

On the other hand, the desire for more can also lead to a fixation on material possessions and personal gain, rather than on personal growth. When individuals become too focused on accumulating wealth and possessions, they may neglect other important aspects of their life, such as their relationships, health, and personal development. This can lead to a stagnation of growth and a lack of fulfillment in life.

Moreover, the pursuit of more can also lead to a sense of discontentment and dissatisfaction. When individuals constantly strive for more, they may never feel satisfied with what they have, leading to a never-ending cycle of desire and dissatisfaction. This can lead to a sense of emptiness and purposelessness, as individuals become disconnected from their true values and goals.

In conclusion, the desire for more can have both positive and negative effects on growth. While it can drive individuals to achieve their goals and reach their full potential, it can also lead to a fixation on material possessions and personal gain, rather than on personal growth. It is important to strike a balance between the desire for more and the pursuit of personal growth, in order to lead a fulfilling and meaningful life.",1,0.9946866,1,True
E83134C87EFA,"Hey there! So, for this essay, I had to research how a positive attitude can impact success and mental health. And let me tell you, it's pretty interesting stuff!

First of all, having a positive attitude can do wonders for your mental health. When you're optimistic and cheerful, you're more likely to feel happy and content, which can help you deal with stress and difficult situations. On the other hand, a negative attitude can lead to feelings of sadness, anxiety, and depression, which can make it harder to succeed in life. Like, who wants to be sad and stressed all the time? Not me!

But that's not all. A positive attitude can also give you opportunities in life. When you're confident and optimistic, people are more likely to want to be around you and help you out. You're more likely to get that promotion at work or get into your dream college. And who doesn't want that?!

On the other hand, a negative attitude can hold you back. When you're always complaining and expecting the worst, people might start to think you're not reliable or trustworthy. And that can make it harder to achieve your goals. Like, if you're always saying ""I'll never be able to do this,"" people might start to believe you and not take you seriously. That's definitely not what you want!

So, there's definitely a correlation between having a positive attitude and achieving success. It's like, if you're always thinking positively and working towards your goals, you're more likely to reach them. And if you're always thinking negatively and expecting failure, you're more likely to fail. It's just basic math, right?

In conclusion, having a positive attitude is super important for both your mental health and your success in life. So, make sure you're always thinking positively and working towards your goals. And if you're feeling negative, try to find ways to change that attitude. Trust me, it'll make a big difference!",1,0.9944534,1,True

Hey there, I know you're really into the idea that aliens created the Face on Mars, but let me tell you, as a scientist at NASA, I'm here to tell you that it's just not true. The Face is actually a natural landform, and I'm going to use evidence from the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" to convince you.

Body:
First of all, the Face is not a perfect rectangle, as it would be if it were created by aliens. It's actually a natural formation that has been eroded over time by the Martian wind and weather. The article states that ""the Face is a eroded mesa, created by the wind and weather over millions of years."" This means that the Face has been formed naturally, and it's not a structure built by intelligent beings.

Secondly, the Face is not unique. The article mentions that ""similar formations can be found throughout the solar system."" This means that the Face is not a one-of-a-kind structure, and it's not something that aliens would have created. It's just a natural part of the Martian landscape.

Thirdly, the Face is not even a face! It's just a hill that, when viewed from a certain angle, looks like a face. The article states that ""the Face is not a face at all, but a hill that has been eroded into a peculiar shape."" So, it's not like aliens came down and built a giant face on Mars. It's just a natural formation that happens to look like a face.

Evidence from the article also suggests that the Face is not a recent structure. The article states that ""the Face has been eroded over millions of years."" This means that the Face has been around for a long time, and it's not something that aliens would have built recently.

Conclusion:
So, there you have it. The Face on Mars is not a structure built by aliens, but a natural landform that has been eroded over time. The evidence from the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" supports this claim, and I hope I've convinced you that the Face is not a sign of alien life. It's just a natural part of the Martian landscape, and it's really cool that we can learn about it and understand how it was formed. Thanks for listening!",1,0.24239507,0,False
llama_70b_v1779,"Driverless cars are coming! They are the future of transportation and are expected to change the way we travel. But are they a good thing or a bad thing? I think they are a bad thing. Let me tell you why.

First of all, driverless cars are not safe. According to the article, there has already been an accident involving a driverless car. A women was killed in Tempe, Arizona when a driverless car hit her while she was walking her bike across the road. This shows that these cars are not yet reliable. They can't even avoid hitting a person! And what about the times when there is a malfunction or a technical difficulty? It's just too risky.

Secondly, driverless cars will take away jobs. The article states that driverless cars will make truck drivers and taxi drivers obsolete. This means that many people will be out of work. This is not a good thing, especially in a time when jobs are already scarce. We need to think about the impact this will have on our economy.

Thirdly, driverless cars will make people lazy. According to the article, people will be able to do other things while in transit, like read a book or watch a movie. While this may seem convenient, it will also make people dependent on technology. They won't even have to bother driving themselves anymore. This will make them lose the ability to drive and be independent.

Lastly, driverless cars are just not necessary. The article states that the main benefit of driverless cars is that they will reduce traffic. But is this really a problem that needs to be solved? I don't think so. We have bigger problems to worry about, like climate change and poverty. We should be focusing on solving those problems instead of making cars that drive themselves.

In conclusion, driverless cars are not a good thing. They are unsafe, will take away jobs, will make people lazy, and are not necessary. We should focus on solving real problems, not creating new ones. So, let's just stick to driving ourselves, it's better that way.",1,0.008439556,0,False

I mean, I know they think it's for our own good, but come on, it's not like we're going to learn any more in that extra time. In fact, I think it's going to have the opposite effect.

First of all, let's talk about my sleep schedule. I'm already having trouble getting up early enough for school as it is, and now they want to add more time to the day? That means I'll be getting home even later in the evening, which means I'll be staying up even later to do my homework. And let's be real, who wants to do homework at midnight? Not me, that's for sure.

I'm already on the fence about joining the debate team, but now with this extra time added to the day, I'll have to choose between that and my part-time job.

I mean, think about it. How much can you really learn in an extra hour and a half? Not that much, let's be real. And what about the time we could be spending on other things? Like, I don't know, extracurriculars or something?

And let's not forget about the impact it will have on our mental health. Adding more time to the day means more stress and more pressure to perform. And let's be real, who needs that?

In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author argues that despite the dangers and difficulties of studying Venus, it is a worthwhile pursuit. The author suggests that studying Venus can help us better understand our own planet, Earth. In this essay, I will evaluate how well the author supports this idea and provide evidence from the article to back up my claim.

Body:
The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthwhile pursuit despite the dangers by highlighting some of the potential benefits of studying Venus. For instance, the author notes that the study of Venus could provide us with valuable information about the Earth's climate system. Venus has a very thick and hot atmosphere that traps heat, causing its surface to reach a temperature of up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Studying these extreme conditions on Venus could help us better understand the impact of global warming on Earth.

Moreover, the author argues that understanding the geology and composition of Venus's surface could help us learn about the Earth's formation. Venus and Earth are very similar in size and composition, so it is reasonable to assume that both planets share some similarities in their geological history. Studying Venus could provide us with information about plate tectonics, volcanoes, and other geological phenomena that could help us understand the Earth's past and present.

The author also notes that exploring Venus could be an excellent opportunity to test new technology and techniques for space exploration. For instance, the development of new materials and equipment that could withstand Venus's harsh conditions could help us explore other planets, like Mars or even some exoplanets. The challenges associated with exploring Venus could lead to new breakthroughs and innovations in space exploration technology.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" makes a compelling case for studying Venus despite the risks it presents. By highlighting some of the potential benefits of studying Venus, the author makes a compelling argument that exploring Venus could help us better understand our own planet and improve space technology. While there are certainly many challenges that would need to be overcome, the potential benefits of exploring Venus are worth the risk. Therefore, it is worth pursuing further exploration of Venus.",1,0.99257153,1,True

And honestly, it's kinda stressful trying to pick a career before we even know what we want to do.

I think it would be way better if we didn't have to think about this stuff until junior year. That way, we can try out different things and see what we like. Like, maybe I'll be into science and math one day, but then I might change my mind and want to be a writer or something. And that's totally okay. It's not like we're gonna regret it or anything if we change our minds.

llama_70b_v1408,"Dear Principal,

I hope this letter finds you well. I wanted to share my thoughts on the idea of requiring all students to perform community service.

I believe that community service is an important aspect of personal development and civic responsibility. By participating in community service, students can learn valuable skills, such as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving, while also giving back to their community.

Many of my friends who participate in community service have shared their positive experiences with me. For example, those who tutor elementary school children have told me how rewarding it is to see their students progress and learn new things. Similarly, those who clean up litter have expressed a sense of pride in keeping their community clean and beautiful.

Moreover, community service can help students develop a sense of empathy and understanding for others. By working with people from different backgrounds and experiences, students can broaden their perspectives and gain a deeper appreciation for the diversity of their community.

However, I also understand that some of my friends may feel that community service takes too much time away from their other responsibilities or interests. It's important to note that not everyone may have the same level of passion or commitment to community service, and that's okay.

In my opinion, requiring all students to perform community service could be beneficial, but it's important to consider a few factors. Firstly, the type of community service should be flexible and allow students to choose an activity that aligns with their interests and availability. Secondly, the amount of time required for community service should be reasonable and not interfere with students' academic or extracurricular activities.

In conclusion, I believe that community service is an valuable experience for students, but it's important to consider the individual needs and interests of each student. By offering flexible and reasonable community service opportunities, students can develop important skills, build empathy, and give back to their community, all while maintaining a healthy balance between their personal and academic responsibilities.

falcon_180b_v1_204,"I believe that dress codes are beneficial to the school environment. Dress codes help to create a positive learning environment by reducing distractions and promoting a sense of equality among students.

Firstly, dress codes reduce distractions in the classroom. When students are dressed appropriately, they are less likely to be distracted by clothing that is too revealing or too casual. This allows students to focus on their studies and engage in meaningful discussions with their peers and teachers. For example, if a student is wearing shorts that are too short, other students may be distracted by this and not pay attention to the lesson being taught.

Secondly, dress codes promote a sense of equality among students. When everyone is dressed the same, it reduces the pressure to keep up with the latest fashion trends and eliminates the possibility of bullying based on clothing. This helps to create a more inclusive and accepting school environment. For example, if a student cannot afford expensive clothing, they may feel left out or bullied by other students who can afford designer brands.

In conclusion, dress codes are beneficial to the school environment because they reduce distractions and promote a sense of equality among students. By implementing a dress code, schools can create a positive learning environment that is conducive to academic success.",1,0.99425936,1,True

9FE2FE6E997E,"In today's fast-paced world, it's easy to become overwhelmed with the demands of daily life. Whether it's school, work, or extracurricular activities, it can be hard to find the time to do everything we want to do. However, I believe that we can accomplish more if we are doing something than if we remain idle.

Firstly, when we are actively engaged in a task, we are able to focus our energy and attention on that task. This allows us to put our best effort into it and achieve our goals more effectively. For example, when studying for an exam, it's much more productive to actively review the material and take notes than it is to simply read over the textbook. By actively engaging in the task, we are able to better understand and retain the information, leading to better grades on the exam.

Secondly, being active can help us to overcome procrastination. Procrastination can be a major obstacle to achieving our goals, as it often leads to wasted time and missed opportunities. By engaging in a task, we are able to make progress and see tangible results, which can motivate us to continue working towards our goals. For example, when working on a group project, it can be tempting to put off starting until the last minute. However, by actively engaging in the task and making progress early on, we can avoid the stress and pressure of rushing to complete the project before the deadline.

Finally, being active can also help us to improve our mental and physical health. When we are idle, we may become bored or restless, which can lead to negative emotions such as anxiety and depression. By engaging in a task, we are able to keep our minds and bodies active and healthy. For example, exercise has been shown to improve mood, reduce stress, and boost overall well-being.

In conclusion, I believe that we can accomplish more if we are doing something than if we remain idle. By actively engaging in a task, we are able to focus our energy and attention, overcome procrastination, and improve our mental and physical health. So the next time you find yourself feeling overwhelmed, try to find a task to engage in and see the difference it can make.",1,0.99465466,1,True
a0ce8841,"Limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can greatly benefit both individuals and the environment. As the passages suggest, there is a global movement towards separating suburban life from auto use, as part of a larger effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve the quality of life in communities.

Firstly, limiting car usage can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of these emissions, and by decreasing the number of cars on the road, we can make a meaningful impact on reducing these harmful pollutants. For example, in Europe, cars account for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and in car-intensive areas in the United States, this number can go up to 50 percent. By adopting car-free or low-car lifestyles, like in the German suburb of Vauban, we can make a positive change in the environment.

Additionally, limiting car usage can improve air quality, especially in heavily polluted areas. Cities like Paris have implemented partial driving bans to combat smog and have seen congestion decrease and air quality improve. By encouraging alternative modes of transportation such as public transit, biking, and walking, we can reduce the amount of harmful pollutants released into the atmosphere, creating healthier and cleaner environments for ourselves and future generations.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to more sustainable and accessible communities. By designing suburbs with smart planning in mind, like placing stores within walking distance and prioritizing public transportation, we can create more compact and efficient communities. This not only reduces the reliance on cars but also promotes healthier and more active lifestyles. As seen in Bogota, Colombia, where millions of people participate in a car-free day each year, car-free initiatives can generate a revolutionary change in how we view transportation and urban development.

Moreover, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. The reduction in the number of vehicles on the road can alleviate traffic congestion, leading to faster commute times and increased productivity. Additionally, by promoting alternative modes of transportation, individuals can save money on fuel and car maintenance costs. Instead of investing in personal vehicles, people can redirect their resources towards public transit systems and other means of transportation that benefit the entire community.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, creating sustainable communities, and providing economic benefits. As we move towards a more environmentally conscious and sustainable future, it is essential to prioritize alternative modes of transportation and promote car-free or low-car lifestyles. By doing so, we can create healthier, cleaner, and more accessible communities for everyone.",1,0.9931902,1,True
BE68C5AB58A1,"The pursuit of success is a lifelong journey that requires dedication, hard work, and perseverance. While some may argue that luck plays a significant role in achieving success, I believe that consistently doing something is the key to unlocking our full potential and reaching our goals.

Firstly, consistently doing something allows us to develop habits that can lead to success. For example, successful entrepreneurs such as Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos have consistently worked towards their goals, even when faced with challenges and setbacks. They have developed habits such as waking up early, working long hours, and constantly learning from their mistakes. These habits have allowed them to achieve success in their respective fields.

Secondly, consistently doing something allows us to build momentum and achieve our goals incrementally. By breaking down our goals into smaller, achievable tasks and consistently working towards them, we can build momentum and see progress towards our ultimate goal. For example, a student who consistently studies and completes their homework will see improvement in their grades and build confidence in their abilities.

However, there is an opposing view that suggests that luck plays a significant role in achieving success. While luck can certainly play a role, it is not the only factor. Successful individuals have consistently worked towards their goals, even when faced with challenges and setbacks. They have developed habits and built momentum that have allowed them to achieve success.

In conclusion, consistently doing something is the key to unlocking our full potential and reaching our goals. By developing habits, building momentum, and consistently working towards our goals, we can achieve success in our personal and professional lives. While luck may play a role, it is not the only factor that determines success.",1,0.99484223,1,True
CEC1115B69DB,"Hey there!  So, for this essay, I had to research Ralph Waldo Emerson's statement and think about a time when I had to work hard and get out of my comfort zone. It's actually pretty cool because I get to share my own personal experience while also explaining why Emerson's statement is so important. 

Okay, so Emerson's statement is: ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.""  It's like, super deep, right? Like, why do we always feel the need to change who we are to fit in or impress others? It's like, why can't we just be ourselves and be proud of it? 

So, let me tell you about that time when I had to get out of my comfort zone.  Last year, I joined the school's debate team.  I know, it's not exactly the most comfortable thing to do, especially since I'm not exactly the most outgoing person.  But, I wanted to challenge myself and learn something new, so I decided to give it a shot.

It was hard, man.  Like, really hard. I had to research and practice and speak in front of people and...  It was just, ugh, so hard.  But, you know what? It was also really rewarding.  Like, I actually started to enjoy it.  I mean, I still get nervous sometimes, but I'm not as scared as I used to be. 

So, why is Emerson's statement important?  Well, think about it. When we're in our comfort zones, we're not really challenging ourselves.  We're not pushing ourselves to be better or to achieve our full potential.  But, when we get out of our comfort zones, that's when we start to grow and learn and become better versions of ourselves.

B3145EA3395B,"Hey, Mrs. Johnson! Here's my essay on how a person's past or environment can affect their first impression and how it may be possible to change it.

First impressions are super important, right? Like, they can make or break how people see you. But have you ever thought about how your past experiences or where you are can affect those first impressions? Like, I know I have. I mean, I've had times when I've met someone new and they've judged me based on something that happened way back when, like in middle school. And it's like, dude, I've grown so much since then! But they don't know that.

So, like, the impact of agreement on conversation is huge. If you're always agreeing with someone, they might think you're boring or don't have your own opinions. But if you're always disagreeing, they might think you're confrontational or hard to get along with. It's like, find that balance, you know? Like, show them you're not just a yes-person, but also that you're not trying to be a jerk.

Okay, so specific examples of how impressions can change. Like, I used to be really shy and introverted, but then I joined the debate team and now I'm way more outgoing and confident. So, like, people might have thought I was super quiet and boring before, but now they see me as more outgoing and funny. And it's not just me! I know people who have changed their impressions of others by, like, working on their communication skills or showing off their talents.

Physical and emotional events can also affect impressions. Like, if someone had a bad day or is going through a tough time, they might come across as grumpy or distant. But if you give them some space and time to deal with their stuff, they might open up and be way more friendly and nice. And the same goes for places and monuments. Like, if you're visiting a new city or landmark, you might be nervous or unsure of yourself at first, but as you explore and get to know the area, you start to feel more comfortable and confident.

falcon_180b_v1_72,"I am a Grade 12 student and I strongly believe that the minimum wage in our country should be raised. There are several reasons why I think so.

Firstly, the cost of living has increased significantly over the years, but the minimum wage has not kept up with this increase. Many people who work minimum wage jobs struggle to make ends meet and provide for their families. Raising the minimum wage would help these individuals to afford basic necessities such as food, housing, and healthcare.

Secondly, a higher minimum wage would stimulate the economy. When people have more money to spend, they are more likely to spend it on goods and services, which in turn creates more jobs and boosts economic growth. This would benefit not only those who work minimum wage jobs, but also businesses and the economy as a whole.

Lastly, raising the minimum wage is simply the right thing to do. Everyone deserves to be paid a fair wage for their work, regardless of the type of job they have. It is unfair for people to work full-time and still live in poverty.

In conclusion, raising the minimum wage in our country is necessary and beneficial for everyone. It would help those who are struggling to make ends meet, stimulate the economy, and ensure that everyone is paid a fair wage for their work.",1,0.99371415,1,True

They help create a professional and respectful atmosphere, which can improve student behavior and academic performance. For example, if students are allowed to wear casual clothes, they might feel too comfortable and not take their studies seriously. On the other hand, dress codes promote a sense of unity among students, as everyone dresses in a similar manner, which can foster a sense of belonging and community. Additionally, dress codes can also help reduce social conflicts and bullying, as students are not differentiated based on their clothing.

However, it's also important to note that dress codes should not be too strict or oppressive. Students should be allowed to express their individuality and personal style, as long as it does not disrupt the learning environment. A balance between maintaining a professional atmosphere and allowing students to express themselves is key.

In my previous school, we had a dress code that required students to wear collared shirts and tie for boys, and knee-length skirts for girls. While it was sometimes frustrating to have to follow these rules, I believe it helped create a sense of discipline and respect for the school environment. It also helped us prepare for future professional settings, where dress codes are often required.

A356547BF789,"Three-year graduation programs have been gaining popularity in recent years, with many schools offering them as an alternative to the traditional four-year program. Generic_School is one such school that offers a three-year graduation program, and in this essay, I will examine the pros and cons of this program and its impacts on the student body.

One of the main advantages of the three-year graduation program is that it allows students to graduate earlier. This can be beneficial for those who are eager to enter the workforce or pursue further education. Additionally, the three-year program can be more cost-effective, as students can save on tuition and other expenses associated with attending school for an additional year.

However, there are also some disadvantages to the three-year graduation program. One of the main concerns is that students may not be fully prepared for the workforce or graduate school. The three-year program may not provide enough time for students to gain the necessary skills and knowledge to succeed in their chosen field. Additionally, some employers may view a three-year degree as less valuable than a four-year degree.

Another potential drawback of the three-year graduation program is that it may not be available to all students. Students who need more time to complete their coursework or who require additional support may not be eligible for the program. This can create a two-tier system, where only the most academically advanced students are able to take advantage of the program.

In terms of its impact on the student body, the three-year graduation program can have both positive and negative effects. On the one hand, it can provide a sense of accomplishment and motivation for students who are able to graduate early. On the other hand, it can create pressure and stress for students who are not able to graduate within the three-year timeframe. Additionally, the program may not be available to all students, which can create feelings of exclusion and resentment among those who are not able to participate.

In conclusion, the three-year graduation program offered by Generic_School has both pros and cons. While it can provide an earlier graduation date and cost savings, it may not be fully prepared students for the workforce or graduate school, and may not be available to all students. Ultimately, it is up to the school and students to carefully consider the benefits and drawbacks",1,0.9919613,1,True

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my opinion regarding the Electoral College and the method by which we elect the President of the United States. After careful consideration and analysis of various perspectives, I firmly believe that the Electoral College should be retained rather than changing to a popular vote system. 

Firstly, the Electoral College preserves the certainty of outcome and reduces the likelihood of disputes over the election results. As is evident from past elections, the winner of the electoral vote invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote, ensuring a conclusive result. For instance, in the 2012 election, President Obama received 61.7% of the electoral vote, whereas he only obtained 51.3% of the popular vote. The winner-take-all system in most states also contributes to a landslide electoral victory and mitigates the possibility of a nationwide tie. This certainty is crucial in maintaining stability and confidence in our electoral process.

Furthermore, the Electoral College ensures that every region of the country has a say in the presidential election. No single region possesses enough electoral votes to secure a victory, requiring candidates to appeal to a diverse range of voters across multiple states. This trans-regional appeal is vital in selecting a president who can effectively represent the entire nation. If a candidate can only win by dominating a single region, it is unlikely that they will be able to address the needs and concerns of citizens in other regions. The Electoral College helps prevent the potential disenfranchisement of voters and promotes a more balanced representation.

In addition, the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes encourages candidates to focus their campaign efforts on swing states. These states, where the election outcome is uncertain, receive the most attention and resources from candidates. This ultimately benefits voters in those states as they become more engaged in the political process, actively listening to and analyzing the policies put forth by competing candidates. The swing states, with their thoughtful and engaged voters, should rightfully play a significant role in deciding the election and shaping the future of our nation.

The Electoral College also provides a safeguard for the political balance between large and small states. The mal-apportionment of the Senate, as decreed in the Constitution, gives more weight to smaller states in the political process. The Electoral College helps restore some equilibrium by allocating electoral votes based on population size. This ensures that presidential candidates must consider the concerns and issues faced by both large and small states, preventing a disproportionate focus on less populated areas.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections in cases where no candidate receives a majority of the popular votes. The system invariably produces a clear winner, avoiding the complexities and uncertainties associated with run-off elections. This streamlined process contributes to the stability and efficiency of our electoral system.

While some argue that the Electoral College may discourage potential voters in states where their preferred candidate is unlikely to win, statistics show that approximately half of eligible Americans still participate in presidential elections. Voters engage in the political process to express their political preferences, irrespective of the possibility that their vote may swing a national election. 

In conclusion, the Electoral College remains the most practical and effective method to elect the President of the United States. It provides certainty in outcomes, ensures the consideration of every region, encourages engagement in swing states, balances the influence of large and small states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. It is imperative that we maintain this system to preserve the stability, fairness, and representative nature of our democracy.

The advancement and proliferation of technology have transformed our world significantly, shaping virtually all aspects of modern society. Its influence is so profound that it's hard to imagine life without gadgets like smartphones, laptops, and tablets. Technology has revolutionized communication, making it possible for people to connect with each other instantly, regardless of location. It has also improved healthcare, education, transportation, and many other sectors. However, this rapid progress comes at a cost. For instance, concerns about privacy violations, job displacement due to automation, and the digital divide between those who can access technology and those who cannot, are increasingly becoming evident. In your opinion, does the positive impact of technology outweigh its negative consequences, or is it the other way around?

When considering the impact of technology on society, one must first acknowledge its role in enhancing communication. The advent of the internet and social media platforms has made global connectivity possible. People can now interact in real-time, share ideas, and collaborate on projects regardless of geographical boundaries. This has led to increased cultural exchange, understanding, and unity among different communities worldwide. Additionally, technology has improved access to information. Search engines and online databases provide users with vast amounts of knowledge at their fingertips, empowering them to make informed decisions and broaden their perspectives.

Technology has also transformed healthcare by enhancing disease prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. Advanced medical equipment, such as MRI machines, CT scanners, and robotic surgical systems, have improved diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes. Moreover, electronic health records (EHRs) have streamlined healthcare delivery by allowing healthcare providers to access patient information quickly and efficiently. Telemedicine, another technological innovation, enables remote consultation, monitoring, and treatment, which is particularly beneficial for patients living in rural or underserved areas.

In the field of education, technology has revolutionized teaching and learning processes. E-learning platforms, educational apps, and online courses have made education more accessible and flexible. Students no longer need to be physically present in a classroom to acquire knowledge; they can learn from anywhere at any time. Furthermore, technology has facilitated personalized learning experiences tailored to individual student needs, enhancing overall academic performance.

In my opinion, standardized tests are not an accurate measure of student ability. In this essay, I will provide reasons and examples to support my argument.

Firstly, standardized tests do not take into consideration a student's background, interests, and learning abilities. A student's ability to excel in school is influenced by many factors such as their home environment, their access to resources, and their interests. A student may be good in one subject but struggle with another subject. Standardized tests do not allow for this variation in abilities.

Secondly, standardized tests do not measure critical thinking and problem-solving skills. A student's ability to think critically and solve problems is crucial for success in life. Standardized tests only measure a student's ability to recall information and answer multiple-choice questions. These tests do not test a student's creativity or their ability to think out of the box.

Finally, standardized tests cause stress and anxiety among students. These tests are used to determine a student's future educational and career paths. The pressure placed on students to excel in these tests can be overwhelming, leading to stress and anxiety. A student's mental health should be a priority in the education system.

In conclusion, standardized tests are not an accurate measure of student ability. These tests do not take into consideration a student's background, interests, and learning abilities. Furthermore, standardized tests do not measure critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Finally, standardized tests cause stress and anxiety among students.

falcon_180b_v1_278,"Single-use plastic products have become a hot topic these days due to their negative effects on the environment. There are people who argue in favor of banning single-use plastic products, while others oppose it. I believe that banning single-use plastic products is the need of the hour, and in this essay, I will provide my reasons to support my viewpoint.

Firstly, single-use plastic products are harmful to the environment. Plastic products such as water bottles, grocery bags, food wrappers, straws, etc., have a significant impact on the environment. Most of these products end up in landfills or oceans, where they remain for hundreds of years and do not degrade easily, causing pollution. Plastic bags, for instance, are one of the most common single-use plastics that end up in landfills, and they can take up to a thousand years to degrade.

Secondly, single-use plastics have a negative impact on wildlife. Animals that live in oceans, such as turtles, dolphins, and seabirds, often mistake plastic bags for food and ingest them, resulting in death by suffocation or starvation. According to National Geographic, more than one million marine animals, birds, and fish are killed due to ocean plastic pollution, which is primarily composed of single-use plastics.

Lastly, single-use plastic products are unnecessary, and we can easily live without them. We have plenty of alternatives to single-use plastics, such as reusable bags, water bottles, and food containers, made of sustainable materials. These alternatives are cost-effective, durable, and environmentally friendly.

On the other hand, those who oppose banning single-use plastics argue that it would be expensive and difficult to implement. It may also lead to job losses in the plastics industry. Moreover, some argue that plastic pollution is not the sole reason behind environmental degradation.

To sum up, while some people might argue against banning single-use plastics, I believe that it is the need of the hour. The negative impacts of single-use plastics on the environment, wildlife, and human health are significant, and we must act now by reducing our plastic usage. It is time for us to embrace sustainable options, and we have many alternatives that can help us in doing so. We can live without single-use plastics, and we must ban them to preserve our planet for future generations.",1,0.98762566,1,True

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I write this letter to express my support for the current Electoral College system and to argue against changing to a popular vote for the election of the President of the United States. The Electoral College, as established by our founding fathers, serves as a vital compromise that ensures the nation's diverse interests are represented, maintains the stability of our elections, and upholds the principles of federalism.

One of the primary benefits of the Electoral College is its ability to provide certainty of outcome. As stated in the Office of the Federal Register's publication, ""The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner."" However, the Electoral College system has actually proven to be more reliable for determining the winner of the presidential election. In most cases, the candidate with the most electoral votes also wins the popular vote. This stability prevents prolonged disputes over election outcomes, as witnessed during the 2000 election crisis discussed by Bradford Plumer in his article.

Furthermore, the Electoral College ensures that the President is elected as a representative of all regions and prevents the dominance of a single geographic area. Judge Richard A. Posner also highlights this point by stating, ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal."" By having candidates campaign in various states, the Electoral College encourages them to address the concerns and needs of voters from different regions. This system promotes the idea of ""everyone's president"" and prevents any one region from feeling as if their votes do not count or that the President will not consider their interests.

The Electoral College also gives importance to swing states, as mentioned in Judge Posner's article. By focusing campaign efforts on these states, candidates are likely to provide more detailed information and pay closer attention to the concerns of swing state voters. This results in more thoughtful voting and better-informed decisions, as these voters have a greater impact on the election outcome. In contrast, a popular vote system may lead to candidates only focusing on densely populated areas or major urban centers, leaving the rest of the country with little to no representation or influence in the election process.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is its ability to give weight to large states in the political balance. With the mal-apportionment of the Senate, small states have an inherent advantage in terms of representing their interests. However, the Electoral College balances this out by providing more attention to large states during campaigns. Without the Electoral College, candidates may overlook the concerns of less populous states, resulting in the majority's tyranny over the minority.

Lastly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the popular vote. This avoids the complications and additional costs associated with run-off elections, allowing for a clear and decisive winner to be determined swiftly. The certainty provided by the Electoral College system is essential in maintaining the stability of our democratic process.

While there are arguments for changing to a popular vote system, such as promoting a more direct form of democracy, it is important to consider the practical benefits of the Electoral College. This system allows for the representation of diverse interests, ensures a stable outcome, and prevents the domination of a specific region or majority. The potential drawbacks of a popular vote system, including the disenfranchisement of voters from noncompetitive states and the risk of lengthy and disputed elections, cannot be ignored.

In conclusion, I urge you to consider the value of the Electoral College system when evaluating any potential changes to our election process. It is a system that has served our nation well, maintaining the stability of our democracy for over two centuries. Amending or replacing it without careful consideration and a thorough examination of the alternatives could have unintended consequences.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will take into account the various perspectives and practical benefits associated with the Electoral College system.

First of all, when you're in a group, you can divide the workload and stuff. Like, if you're working on a big project, it can be really hard to do it all by yourself. But if you're in a group, you can assign tasks to each other and work on different parts of the project. This way, you can get the work done faster and more efficiently. Plus, you don't have to worry about doing all the work yourself, which can be really stressful.

Another thing is that working in a group can help you learn how to communicate better. Like, you have to communicate with your group members to make sure everyone knows what they're doing and when things are due. This can help you learn how to express yourself clearly and listen to others. It's also important to be able to work through conflicts and disagreements, which can happen in any group.

A35F3D111E9A,"One need not look very far to find proof of the concept that growth can only happen if one is willing to step out of their comfort zone and try something new and challenging. Take, for instance, the story of John, a successful web-developer who had been working in the same position for the past five years. Despite his happiness in his job and consistent success, he felt a nagging feeling that he wanted to try something different. So he decided to take a risk and enrolled in a course in web-design, something which he had never tried before. Though the course was challenging and he had to put in a lot of extra effort, he eventually found success and was able to switch to a new career working in web-design.

The potential risk associated with trying something new is failure and disappointment. The potential reward of trying something outside of one's comfort zone is the satisfaction of having gained new knowledge and experiences, ultimately leading to greater happiness and success. The statement “Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow in life” is certainly true—at least for John.",1,0.9930829,1,True

I mean, I've been there.  Like, I've been bullied before, and it's not fun.  It's actually really hurtful and can make you feel like you're all alone.  But, you know what? We don't have to put up with it! 

First of all, we need to respect each other.  Like, we need to treat others the way we want to be treated.  It's simple, but it's important. If we can all just be kind to each other, we can avoid a lot of problems. 

And, you know what else can help?  Having fun without resorting to violence!  Like, there are so many things we can do that don't involve hurting others. We can play games, or draw pictures, or even just hang out and talk.

E9F50492B159,"Curfews have been a common practice for parents to impose on their teenage children for many years. The main purpose of curfews is to keep teenagers out of trouble and ensure their safety. In this essay, I will analyze the ways in which curfews can achieve these goals and how they can benefit teenagers in other ways.

Firstly, curfews can protect teenagers from the dangers associated with being out at night. There are many risks that teenagers face when they are out late at night, such as being exposed to drugs, alcohol, and violence. Curfews can help prevent these risks by limiting the amount of time that teenagers have to engage in potentially harmful activities. Additionally, curfews can also help teenagers avoid being involved in accidents or other dangerous situations that may occur at night.

Secondly, curfews can provide teenagers with more time for family and relationships. Teenagers often have busy schedules and may not have enough time to spend with their families or friends. Curfews can help address this issue by giving teenagers more time to spend with their loved ones. This can help strengthen family bonds and improve relationships with friends and other important people in their lives.

Finally, curfews can help teenagers become more responsible. By imposing curfews, parents can teach their teenagers the importance of being responsible and accountable for their actions. Teenagers who are subject to curfews must plan their activities in advance and be mindful of their time. This can help them develop important skills such as time management, organization, and self-discipline.

In conclusion, curfews can be an effective tool for keeping teenagers out of trouble and ensuring their safety. They can also provide teenagers with more time for family and relationships and help them become more responsible. While curfews may not be perfect, they can be a valuable tool for parents to use in helping their teenagers grow and develop into responsible adults.",1,0.99440575,1,True
8A80B525C75D,"Winston Churchill's statement, ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm,"" is one that resonates with many, as it eloquently boils down the mindset of a successful and inspiring individual. It is a reminder that, after failure, one must remain passionate and determined in order to see success in the end. Churchill himself embodied this phrase throughout his life, highlighted by his long and varied career in public service. 

For example, Churchill's political career was fraught with several failure, most notably his losing the 1945 general election despite his tremendous effort in leading the country during World War II. Although his party was soundly defeated, Churchill did not lose his enthusiasm and instead chose to continue fighting for the causes he believed in. His resilience in these moments of failure, such as sticking to his guns when delivering his iconic ironic proverb in the middle ofpolitcal chaos, is a testament to his ability to stay motivated despite trying times. 

In addition to his politics, Churchill's record-breaking writing career was filled with hurdles. Despite battling depression and bouts of writer's block, Churchill never lost his enthusiasm for writing and continued to persevere until he completed his impressive body of work. His ability to continue in the face of adversity is an example of Churchill's embodiment of his own famous phrase and reinforces the notion of success stemming from the persistence of enthusiasm. 

Ultimately, Winston Churchill's statement, ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm,"" is a reminder that the essence of success lies not in avoiding failure, but in staying dedicated and passionate whenever it occurs. Churchill's own experiences in politics and writing demonstrate that remaining enthusiastic and resilient in the face of adversity is truly the driving force behind success.",1,0.99301106,1,True
D30D6D7F3D39,"Working in a group or working alone has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. While some people may prefer to work alone, others may find it more beneficial to work in a group. In this essay, I will discuss the benefits of working together in a group versus working alone, and provide examples to support my argument.

Working in a group can be very beneficial as it allows for the exchange of ideas and perspectives. When people work together, they can bounce ideas off each other and come up with creative solutions to problems. This can lead to more innovative and effective solutions than if someone were to work alone. For example, in a group project at school, my classmates and I worked together to create a presentation on climate change. We each brought our own unique ideas and perspectives to the project, and through our discussions and collaborations, we were able to create a well-rounded and informative presentation.

Another benefit of working in a group is the opportunity to learn from others. When people work together, they can learn from each other's strengths and weaknesses. This can help to improve their own skills and knowledge, and can also lead to better communication and understanding between team members. For example, in a group project at school, my classmates and I worked together to create a business plan for a fictional company. We each had different areas of expertise, and through our collaborations, we were able to learn from each other and improve our own skills.

Working alone can also have its benefits, such as increased focus and productivity. When people work alone, they can often be more focused on their task and less distracted by the thoughts and ideas of others. This can lead to increased productivity and efficiency. For example, when I am studying for an exam, I often prefer to work alone in a quiet environment. This allows me to focus on my studies and avoid distractions.

In conclusion, working together in a group and working alone both have their own set of benefits. Working in a group allows for the exchange of ideas and perspectives, as well as the opportunity to learn from others. Working alone can lead to increased focus and productivity. Ultimately, the best approach depends on the task at hand and the individual's preferences.",1,0.99422824,1,True

Getting to know someone beyond their appearance and surface level traits can cause a drastic shift in opinion. In addition, even the smallest of changes in behavior or attitude can sway a person to have a different first impression. As a person continues to interact with the individual, their perception and attitude about that person can change as a result of new experiences or conversations. 

By interacting with the individual more, a person can form a better understanding of the individual. This could lead to a far different view of the individual from the initial first impression. As this understanding develops, any preconceived notions or biases about the individual can fade away, creating an entirely different opinion than the one initially formed. 

In conclusion, first impressions of someone can evolve and differ from the initial one formed over time. Factors such as getting to know someone better and forming a better understanding of them can lead to differences in opinion.

llama_70b_v1330,"Hi, my dear friend! I'm so glad you asked me about why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. It's like, when you're trying to pick a movie to watch with your family, you wouldn't just ask one person what they want to watch, right? You'd ask a few people, like your parents, your siblings, and maybe even your friends, to get a better idea of what everyone wants to see.

That's because, when you ask just one person, they might have a different opinion than the others. Like, if you only ask your mom, she might say she wants to watch a romantic comedy, but your dad might want to watch an action movie. If you only ask one of your friends, they might want to watch a horror movie, but another friend might want to watch a funny movie.

So, by asking multiple people, you can get a better idea of what everyone wants. It's like, you're getting a bunch of different perspectives, and you can pick the best one that everyone will enjoy. It's not just about what one person thinks, it's about what everyone thinks.

And, it's not just for movies, it's for everything! Like, if you're trying to decide where to go for dinner, you might ask your family members or friends for their opinions. Someone might suggest a really great Italian restaurant, while another person might suggest a yummy Chinese place. By asking multiple people, you can find a restaurant that everyone will like.

Plus, seeking multiple opinions can also help you avoid making a bad choice. Like, if you only ask one person, they might suggest something that's not very good, or that you might not like. But, if you ask multiple people, they can give you different options and you can pick the best one.

llama_70b_v1417,"Gun control is a really important issue that affects lots of people. I think it's important to have stricter gun control laws. One reason is that it can help prevent shootings and violence. If people can't get their hands on guns as easily, then they can't use them to hurt others. This can make communities safer and prevent tragedies from happening.

Another reason is that it can help reduce the number of suicides. Sometimes people who are feeling sad or hopeless might use a gun to hurt themselves. If they can't get access to a gun, then they might not be able to do something permanent. This can give them a chance to get help and feel better.

A third reason is that it can help stop criminals from getting guns. If it's harder for criminals to get guns, then they might not be able to do as much harm. This can help keep people and their property safe.

I also want to say that I understand some people might think that stricter gun control laws won't work or that they'll take away people's rights. But I think it's important to balance people's rights with the need to keep everyone safe. We need to make sure that people are safe and that we're doing everything we can to prevent violence and harm.

Some argue that having a positive attitude is essential to achieving success, while others believe that it is not a significant factor. In this essay, I will investigate the impact of having a positive attitude on achieving success in life, examine examples of individuals with a positive attitude who achieved success, and analyze the benefits of having a positive attitude versus a negative one.

Firstly, having a positive attitude can have a significant impact on achieving success in life. It can help individuals to stay motivated, focused, and persistent in the face of challenges. A positive attitude can also help individuals to see opportunities where others may only see obstacles, which can lead to new opportunities and success. For example, Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple, had a positive attitude that helped him to overcome numerous challenges and achieve great success.

Secondly, there are many examples of individuals with a positive attitude who achieved success. One such example is Oprah Winfrey, who faced numerous challenges in her life, including poverty, abuse, and discrimination. Despite these challenges, Oprah maintained a positive attitude and used her experiences to inspire others. Her positive attitude helped her to achieve great success in her career as a talk show host, actress, and philanthropist.

On the other hand, having a negative attitude can have a significant impact on achieving success in life. It can lead to procrastination, lack of motivation, and a tendency to give up easily in the face of challenges. A negative attitude can also lead individuals to focus on the negative aspects of a situation, which can lead to missed opportunities and failure. For example, many people who struggle with depression and anxiety often have a negative attitude that can impact their ability to achieve success.

When comparing the benefits of having a positive attitude versus a negative one, it is clear that having a positive attitude is the better choice. A positive attitude can help individuals to stay motivated, focused, and persistent in the face of challenges, which can lead to greater success.

Some opponents also argue that it is unfair to force extra-curricular activities upon students who may not have the same financial or social resources to devote to them.

At the end of the day, the evaluation of these arguments must come down to the priority and best interests of the students.

Subject: In Favor of the Electoral College

Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my support for the continuance of the Electoral College as the method of choosing the President of the United States. While there are arguments in favor of changing to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College provides significant benefits that outweigh the drawbacks.

One of the key advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty it provides in determining the outcome of the presidential election. As stated by Judge Richard A. Posner in his article, ""A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible—it happened in 2000—but it’s less likely than a dispute over the popular vote."" This means that the electoral system ensures a clear winner, even if they do not secure the majority of the popular vote. This certainty is crucial for maintaining a stable and functioning democracy.

Furthermore, the Electoral College ensures that the president represents a diverse range of interests by requiring candidates to have trans-regional appeal. As Judge Posner explains, ""No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president."" This prevents candidates from solely focusing their campaigns on densely populated urban areas or specific regions of the country. It forces presidential candidates to consider the needs and concerns of voters in different areas, resulting in a more inclusive and representative presidency.

The winner-take-all method of the Electoral College also encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, as mentioned by Judge Posner. This means that candidates are incentivized to listen to the concerns of voters in these states and address their issues. Swing states represent a diverse range of perspectives and are often microcosms of the entire nation. As a result, the policies and promises made by candidates in these states tend to resonate with voters across the country. This system allows for a fair and balanced representation of the nation's interests.

Additionally, the Electoral College gives appropriate weight to the role of big states in the political process. As Judge Posner highlights, ""The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution."" This ensures that the concerns and needs of voters in populous states have adequate representation and influence in the election process.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the complications and uncertainty that arise from run-off elections. As Judge Posner points out, ""The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast."" This allows for a smooth and efficient election process, saving time, money, and resources.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system provides a fair and balanced approach to electing the President of the United States. It ensures certainty in determining the outcome, represents a diverse range of interests, encourages candidates to campaign in swing states, gives appropriate weight to big states, and avoids the need for run-off elections. While some argue for a change to a popular vote system, the benefits of the Electoral College far outweigh the drawbacks. I urge you to consider retaining this system to maintain the integrity and stability of our democracy.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that you will carefully consider the points raised in this letter. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you require any further information or have any questions regarding my views.

So, it turns out that first impressions are super important because they can shape how we view someone or something forever! 😱 Like, if someone meets you for the first time and you're being really grumpy or messy, they might think you're not a cool or interesting person. 🙅‍♂️ And once they form that opinion, it can be really hard to change it! 💪

It's like, if someone hears a rumor about someone else and it's really negative, they might automatically assume it's true without even asking for proof. 🗣️ And once that rumor is out there, it can be hard to make it go away. 🙅‍♀️ Like, if someone has a bad first impression of a new teacher, they might not even give them a chance to show how cool they are in class. 📚

But, it's not all bad news! 😊 Sometimes, people can change their minds about someone or something after getting to know them better. 🤝 Like, if someone has a bad first impression of a new friend, but then they spend more time with them and see how funny or kind they are, they might start to like them more. 🤝 And if someone learns more about a topic they thought they didn't like, they might change their mind and find it interesting. 📚

However, it can be really hard to change someone's opinion if it's based on something really strong, like a personal experience. 💔 Like, if someone had a bad experience with a dog when they were little, they might be scared of dogs forever, no matter how many times they learn about how great they are. 🐶

As a young cowboy from Montana, I never thought I'd have the chance to ride the waves and see the world. But thanks to the Seagoing Cowboys program, I was able to do just that. And let me tell you, it was the experience of a lifetime!

First of all, let's talk about the adventure. As a seagoing cowboy, I got to ride on a ship across the ocean, taking care of horses and other animals along the way. It was exhilarating to feel the salty spray on my face and the wind in my hair as we sailed through the waves. And the views? Absolutely breathtaking! I saw dolphins, whales, and even a school of sharks! It was like nothing I'd ever seen before.

But it wasn't just about the adventure. The Seagoing Cowboys program also gave me the opportunity to visit some truly unique places. We stopped at ports in Europe, South America, and even Africa! I got to see different cultures, try new foods, and meet people from all walks of life. It was an education in itself, and one that I'll never forget.

And let's not forget the friends I made along the way. The other cowboys on the ship became like family to me. We worked together, played together, and supported each other through the ups and downs of the journey. It was amazing to be surrounded by people who shared my passion for animals and adventure.

Now, I know what you're thinking: isn't it dangerous to ride on a ship with animals? And what about seasickness? Well, let me tell you, the Seagoing Cowboys program takes safety very seriously. We were trained on how to care for the animals and keep them safe during the journey. And as for seasickness, well, let's just say it's a rite of passage for any sailor! But trust me, it's worth it.

So, if you're looking for an adventure that will broaden your horizons and give you memories that will last a lifetime, join the Seagoing Cowboys program! You won't regret it.

In conclusion, the Seagoing Cowboys program is an incredible opportunity for anyone who loves adventure, animals, and travel. It's a chance to experience things that most people can only dream of, and to make lifelong friends along the way. So come on, saddle up, and join the Seagoing Cowboys!

EA857E7CEFD9,"When considering whether to add one and a half more hours to the school day, several important factors must be taken into account. Firstly, providing an extended school day would take away from time students otherwise would spend on after-school activities, such as club meetings or sports practices. For instance, a student who is on the school's football team would have to decide between sacrificing time spent developing their team skills or risk sacrificing their academic pursuits. 

Secondly, this extra hour and a half would also put a strain on our already stretched teachers and staff. As the school day length increases, so do the workloads for teachers, making it harder for them to focus on their students. Additionally, due to the lack of time for other pursuits such as research, the pay might become too poor to attract new teachers and staff.

Finally, this longer school day would leave students tired and unable to learn as effectively as they would when properly rested. During an extended school day, students would be less alert and less likely to absorb what they are taught, reducing the quality of their education. 

These are just a few of the reasons why the school should not add one and a half more hours to the school day. It is important to take student's health, well-being, and education into account when determining what is best for the school.

State parks are a great place to visit for a variety of reasons. One of the biggest advantages of going to a state park is the opportunity to enjoy nature. State parks are typically located in beautiful areas with stunning views, hiking trails, and wildlife. This provides visitors with a chance to get away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life and connect with the natural world.

Another advantage of state parks is the variety of activities that are available. State parks often have hiking trails, camping sites, fishing spots, and picnic areas. Visitors can also participate in educational programs, such as ranger-led tours or interpretive exhibits. These activities provide visitors with a chance to be active and enjoy the outdoors.

The best time to visit a state park is during the fall season. The cooler temperatures and changing colors of the leaves make for a beautiful backdrop. Additionally, many state parks have fall festivals or events that visitors can participate in, such as pumpkin carving or apple cider tasting.

When compared to other types of parks, such as city parks or private parks, state parks offer a more natural and wild experience. City parks are often more crowded and have more man-made features, while private parks may have higher fees and restrictions. State parks provide a balance between these two extremes, offering visitors a chance to enjoy nature while still having access to amenities and activities.

Fees associated with state park activities vary depending on the park and the activity. Some parks charge an entrance fee, while others have separate fees for activities such as camping or fishing. It's important for visitors to research the fees associated with the park they plan to visit and plan accordingly.

Outdoor activities have been shown to have positive effects on both mental and physical health. Spending time in nature has been linked to reduced stress and anxiety, improved mood, and increased feelings of happiness and well-being. Additionally, physical activities such as hiking or camping can provide a great workout and improve overall fitness levels.

You can take breaks whenever you want, and you don't have to worry about like, bothering anyone else. It's like, super flexible and all that. Plus, you can like, focus on your own stuff without anyone distracting you. 💭

But, like, there are also some downsides to working independently. For example, you might not have anyone to like, bounce ideas off of or ask for help when you need it. And sometimes, it's hard to stay motivated when you're working alone. Like, you might get bored or lose interest in the project. 😴

Now, let's talk about working in a group. Like, I think it's pretty cool that you can like, collaborate with other people and learn from them. You can share ideas and come up with stuff together. It's like, super social and all that. Plus, you can like, motivate each other and stuff. 🤝

So, like, in my opinion, working in a group is better than working independently. Like, you get to learn from other people and collaborate on stuff. And you can like, motivate each other and stuff. Plus, it's super fun to work with other people and brainstorm ideas together. 💡

So, let's dive in! 🏀 One of the coolest things I found out while researching is that some soccer players, like Gerard Pique, have tried different things to grow as people. Like, can you imagine?! 🤯 Pique is a pro soccer player for Barcelona, and he's also a dad! 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 He's been doing all sorts of cool stuff outside of soccer, like learning to play the guitar and even starting his own charity foundation. 🎸🏆

But here's the thing: not all soccer players are like Pique. Some players, like Lionel Messi, have focused on one thing and one thing only – soccer! 🏈🔥 Messi is like, the best soccer player ever, and he's been playing since he was like, five years old or something. He's so good at soccer that he could probably win a game with his eyes closed! 😴 But, even though he's super focused on soccer, he still finds time to do other things he enjoys, like playing video games and hanging out with his friends. 😂

So, what's the difference between these two scenarios? Why do some soccer players try different things, while others specialize in one thing? Well, I think it's because everyone is different, and what works for one person might not work for another. 🤷‍♀️ For example, Pique might enjoy playing the guitar and starting a charity, but Messi might not have the time or interest in those things. And that's totally okay! 🙌

But here's the thing: trying different things can actually help us grow as people. 🌱 When we",1,0.99251294,1,True
E0BABC4506D0,"Extracurricular activities are an important part of a student's life. They provide opportunities for students to develop new skills, make new friends, and contribute to their community. However, not all students choose to get involved in extracurricular activities. In this essay, I will explore the factors that students consider when deciding to get involved in extracurricular activities.

One of the main factors that students consider when deciding to get involved in extracurricular activities is their interests. Students are more likely to participate in activities that they enjoy and are passionate about. For example, a student who enjoys playing sports may choose to join a sports team, while a student who enjoys music may choose to join a band or choir.

Another factor that students consider is the time commitment required for the activity. Extracurricular activities often require a significant amount of time and effort, and students must balance their academic and personal responsibilities. Some students may choose not to get involved in extracurricular activities because they do not have the time or energy to commit to them.

The potential benefits of participating in extracurricular activities is also a factor that students consider. Many students believe that getting involved in extracurricular activities can help them stand out to colleges and employers. Participation in extracurricular activities can also provide opportunities for students to develop leadership skills, teamwork skills, and other valuable life skills.

Finally, the social aspect of extracurricular activities is also an important consideration for many students. Extracurricular activities provide opportunities for students to make new friends and build relationships with other students who share their interests. This can be particularly important for students who may feel isolated or disconnected from their peers.

In conclusion, there are many factors that students consider when deciding to get involved in extracurricular activities. These factors include their interests, the time commitment required, the potential benefits, and the social aspect of the activity. Ultimately, whether or not a student chooses to get involved in extracurricular activities is a personal decision that depends on their individual circumstances and priorities.",1,0.9939737,1,True

I know, I know, it sounds super important and all that jazz. But, like, let me tell you, it's actually pretty interesting once you start digging into it.

First off, technology can totally improve communication.  Like, think about it. With all the social media platforms and messaging apps, it's so much easier to keep in touch with friends and family who live far away. You can send them messages, share photos and videos, and even make video calls! It's like being there in person, but without having to physically be there.  And, let's be real, who doesn't love the convenience of being able to communicate with their crush from across the room without having to, like, stand up and walk over to them?

Like, imagine being able to send emails and messages to coworkers and clients without having to physically be in the same room as them. It's like, so much faster and more efficient. Plus, you can access important documents and information from anywhere, at any time. 

Now, let's talk about family time.  I know some people might think that technology is taking over our lives and stuff, but, like, it can actually help us spend more time with our families.  For example, you can play online games with your siblings or parents, or even watch movies or TV shows together over video calls. It's like, a fun way to bond and spend time together even when you're not in the same room. 

And, lastly, technology can help with job responsibilities.  Like, think about it.

First off, social media's made us all a bunch of narcissists. We're all about takin' selfies and postin' 'em online, seein' how many likes we can get. We're more worried about our online image than we are about the real world around us. I mean, have you seen all those Instagram influencers? They're makin' bank off of their looks and their fake personalities. It's like, what's the point?

They'll post mean comments and hurtful things, and then they'll just delete it and act like nothin' happened. It's like, hello, words have power, people! You can't just take 'em back like that.

EB5924FBD25C,"Extending the school day can have both benefits and drawbacks. On the one hand, adding two extra hours for students and teachers could provide more educational opportunities and allow teachers to cover more material. On the other hand, some students and teachers may not have the ability to stay later due to work or family commitments. 

When considering the benefit of adding time in the school day, there are two main possibilities. The first is adding an extra hour to each school subject. This allows for more in-depth study of each subject and more time for engaging activities or discussions, which can be beneficial for understanding and mastering material. The second is adding an extra school subject. This could be useful for a range of reasons, such as enabling students to take advanced or specialized courses or providing more opportunities to explore their interests.

However, an extended school day also comes with certain drawbacks. Teachers may feel pressured to cover more material in a shorter amount of time, while students may feel overwhelmed and overworked. Additionally, if students and teachers are expected to stay longer, they may not get as much free time for extracurricular activities or socializing, which can have a negative impact on their mental and physical health.

To make an extended school day successful, certain strategies are necessary. Teachers should be provided additional support for planning and teaching their lessons. Additionally, alternative courses and activities should be available for students to engage in after traditional classes, such as physical education, music, and art classes. Finally, free time and socialization should be encouraged and supported for both students and teachers to help them manage the challenges of the longer school day.",1,0.99404114,1,True

This checklist typically includes elements such as identifying the audience, developing a thesis statement, and planning out the structure of the essay or writing piece. It’s essential to be familiar with this checklist and understand why it’s so important to utilize it in the writing process. 

When drafting an outline, take note of the key arguments of why using a writing checklist is beneficial. Consider adding supporting details of how the checklist helps the writer with organization, and developing a clear purpose and direction for the piece.

F1AAB82CE621,"An impression refers to the way a person is perceived by others based on their attitude, behavior, and actions. It is a person's overall appearance, demeanor, and personality that others form an opinion about them based on. A person's impression can be positive or negative, and it can affect how others interact with them.

An individual's attitude and behavior can greatly influence their impression. A person's attitude can be determined by their personality traits, such as being outgoing, friendly, or reserved. A person's behavior can be influenced by their upbringing, cultural background, and personal experiences. A person's attitude and behavior can also be shaped by their interactions with others. For example, if a person consistently behaves in a negative manner, others may form a negative impression of them.

Celebrities and prominent people often use their impression to create an impact. They understand that their image and reputation are important to their career and personal brand. They use their impression to promote their products, services, and causes. For example, a celebrity may use their impression to endorse a charity or cause they believe in. They may also use their impression to promote their personal brand, such as their clothing line or fragrance.

An individual's impression can be used as a tool or gift. For example, a person may use their impression to make a positive impact on others. They may use their impression to make others feel comfortable and at ease. They may also use their impression to inspire others to be kind and compassionate.

To ensure their impression is not damaged by their behavior, an individual should be mindful of their actions and words.

ba489c6d,"The advantages of limiting car usage are becoming increasingly clear, as demonstrated by examples from around the world. Vauban, a suburb in Germany, has implemented a car-free policy, with only two places available for car parking. As a result, 70% of families in Vauban do not own cars, and 57% of residents sold their cars when they moved there. The residents of Vauban have found that giving up their cars has led to a decrease in stress and an overall increase in happiness. This trend is not limited to Germany; it is growing in Europe, the United States, and other parts of the world.

Limiting car usage is an essential step towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are responsible for a significant percentage of greenhouse gas emissions in both Europe and the United States. By separating suburban life from the use of cars, communities like Vauban are able to drastically reduce emissions from tailpipes. This approach is known as ""smart planning"" and involves making suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation, as well as reducing the space available for parking. By placing stores within walking distance on a main street, instead of in malls along highways, communities can encourage residents to rely less on cars for their everyday needs.

Efforts to limit car usage are gaining traction in the United States as well. The Environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities, and legislators are beginning to take action. It is expected that public transportation serving suburbs will play a much larger role in federal transportation bills in the coming years. In the past, the majority of funding has gone towards highways, but that is likely to change as the importance of reducing car usage becomes more widely recognized.

Other cities around the world are also implementing car-free initiatives. Paris recently enforced a partial driving ban to combat smog, and the ban led to a 60% decrease in congestion. Bogota, Colombia has been hosting a car-free day for the past few years, which has gained popularity and drawn the attention of municipal authorities from other countries. These cities are discovering that limiting car usage not only improves air quality but also promotes alternative transportation options, reduces stress, and creates a more connected and vibrant community.

The decrease in driving and car ownership in the United States may indicate a fundamental shift in American behavior. Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. This trend could have significant implications for carbon emissions and the environment, as transportation is one of the largest sources of emissions in the country. While the decrease in driving can partly be attributed to the recession, researchers believe that there is something more fundamental going on. Factors such as the rise of telecommuting, the renewal of center cities, and the availability of car-pooling apps are all contributing to a cultural shift away from car dependence.

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are numerous and impactful. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions to improving air quality and reducing stress, communities around the world are finding that embracing alternative transportation options and creating car-free spaces can lead to significant benefits. By reimagining suburbs and promoting the use of public transportation, walking, and biking, we can create more sustainable and vibrant communities for future generations.",1,0.988172,1,True
F100483B6259,"The quote from Ralph Waldo Emerson, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow,"" highlights the importance of stepping out of one's comfort zone and challenging oneself to learn and grow. Exploring the world around us is a crucial aspect of this growth, as it allows us to expand our horizons and gain new perspectives.

Exploring the world can be done in many ways, such as traveling to new places, trying new foods, meeting new people, and learning about different cultures. By stepping out of our comfort zones and embracing new experiences, we can challenge ourselves to think differently and develop new skills. This can help us grow mentally and intellectually, as we learn to adapt to new situations and think critically.

Continuing one's education is also an important aspect of personal growth. By pursuing higher education or taking advanced courses, we can develop our intellect and gain a deeper understanding of the world around us. This can help us in many ways, such as increasing our earning potential, pursuing our passions, and making a positive impact on the world.

Gaining knowledge is also crucial in helping us navigate life's challenges. By understanding the world around us and the people in it, we can make better decisions and navigate difficult situations. This can help us achieve our goals and lead more fulfilling lives.

In conclusion, exploring the world, continuing one's education, and gaining knowledge are all important aspects of personal growth. By stepping out of our comfort zones and challenging ourselves to learn and grow, we can develop our intellect and gain new perspectives that can help us in many ways.

Imagination allows us to dream, devise plans, and think outside the box. In short, it gives us the confidence and motivation to try something new and make it happen.

Take the example of Elon Musk, who envisioned a world in which electric cars become the norm and space exploration was feasible for everyone. Through his imagination he was driven to build the electric car company Tesla and SpaceX. His successful vision was made possible by his ingenious imagination rather than sheer knowledge.

On the other hand, knowledge is important in the process of achieving success, however, without imagination, it is unlikely that this knowledge can be leveraged effectively. Knowledge without creativity and imagination is like driving a car without a destination. It's essential to understand the science behind what we are creating, but without creative ideas to guide us, all the knowledge in the world is useless.

In summary, imagination is just as important as knowledge when it comes to achieving success.

bcf6b696,"Limiting car usage can have many advantages for both individuals and society as a whole. This is evident in the examples of Vauban in Germany, Paris in France, and Bogota in Colombia, where initiatives have been implemented to reduce car dependency and promote alternative forms of transportation. By limiting car usage, not only can greenhouse gas emissions be reduced, but other benefits such as improved air quality, reduced congestion, and enhanced community connections can also be achieved.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a major contributor to these emissions, with passenger cars alone responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing the number of cars on the road, as seen in Vauban, emissions can be significantly decreased, leading to a cleaner and healthier environment.

In addition to reducing emissions, limiting car usage can also have a positive impact on air quality. The smog problem faced by cities like Paris is a direct result of vehicle emissions, particularly from diesel fuel. By enforcing driving bans, like the one implemented in Paris, cities can effectively reduce air pollution and improve the overall health of their citizens.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction in congestion. Cities like Bogota have implemented car-free days to alleviate traffic congestion and promote alternative forms of transportation. By encouraging people to use public transportation, walk, or cycle, roads become less congested and commuting becomes more efficient for everyone. This not only saves time but also reduces stress for commuters.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can help strengthen community connections. In neighborhoods like Vauban, where cars are not allowed on the streets, people rely on bicycles and walking as their primary means of transportation. This not only encourages a more active and healthy lifestyle, but it also fosters a sense of community among residents who interact more frequently. In addition, having stores and amenities within walking distance, as seen in Vauban, promotes local businesses and reduces the need for long drives to shopping malls.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for individuals and society. It helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, alleviate congestion, and enhance community connections. By looking at successful examples like Vauban, Paris, and Bogota, it is clear that smart planning and the promotion of alternative transportation can lead to a more sustainable and livable future. It is crucial for individuals and governments alike to recognize the benefits of limiting car usage and work towards implementing policies that promote more sustainable forms of transportation.",1,0.9929658,1,True
llama_70b_v12,"When peoples ask for advices, they sometimes talk to more than one person. This is a good thing to do because it can help them make a better choise.

One reason why seeking multiplie opinions can help is because different peoples have different perspectives. For example, if you ask your parents and your friends for advice, they might have different ideas about what you should do. Your parents might think that you should do something that is safe and stable, like going to college and getting a job. But your friends might think that you should do something that is more fun and exciting, like traveling or starting your own business. By hearing both sides, you can get a better understanding of the pros and cons of each option and make a more informed decision.

Another reason why seeking multiplie opinions can help is because it can help you avoid bias. Sometimes, peoples can get stuck in their own way of thinking and they might not see all the possibilities. If you only ask one person for advice, they might give you a biased opinion that is not really in your best interest. But if you ask multiple peoples, you can get a more well-rounded view of the situation and make a more fair choise.

For example, let's say you want to buy a new phone. You could ask your friend who works at the phone store for advice, but they might just try to sell you the most expensive phone. But if you also ask your brother who is a tech expert, he might tell you that there are cheaper options that are just as good. By hearing both opinions, you can make a more informed decision and save money.

falcon_180b_v1_411,"The advent of social media has revolutionized the way we communicate and share information. With a few clicks, we can connect with friends and family from around the world, share our thoughts and experiences, and stay up-to-date on the latest news and trends. However, this increased connectivity has come with a cost: the loss of privacy. As a result, there is a growing need for stronger privacy protections on social media platforms.

On one hand, proponents of stronger privacy protections argue that social media companies have a responsibility to protect their users' personal information. This includes everything from basic contact information to more sensitive data such as credit card numbers and medical records. Without adequate safeguards in place, this information could be accessed by hackers, identity thieves, and other malicious actors, putting users at risk of financial fraud or even physical harm.

Furthermore, social media platforms often collect and use personal data for targeted advertising purposes. While this can be beneficial for both users and advertisers, it raises concerns about the potential for abuse. For example, if a user's data is used to target them with political ads, they may be more susceptible to manipulation or misinformation. In some cases, this could even undermine the integrity of democratic processes.

On the other hand, opponents of stronger privacy protections argue that social media users should be responsible for managing their own privacy settings and sharing only the information they are comfortable with. They argue that users have the freedom to choose which platforms they use and how much personal information they share, and that it is not the responsibility of social media companies to police this behavior.

Additionally, some argue that stronger privacy protections could stifle innovation and limit the potential benefits of social media. For example, if social media companies are required to obtain explicit consent before collecting or using personal data, they may be less able to develop new features or services that rely on this data.

In conclusion, while there are valid arguments on both sides of the debate, I believe that stronger privacy protections are needed on social media platforms. The potential risks of data breaches and misuse are simply too great to ignore, and social media companies have a responsibility to protect their users' personal information. At the same time, users should also take steps to manage their own privacy settings and be mindful of the information they share online. By working together, we can create a safer and more secure social media environment for all.",1,0.9933975,1,True

For example, if a student is deciding whether or not to pursue a certain extracurricular activity, taking into account the opinions of their parents, teachers, and friends can help ensure that the decision is well-informed and takes into account the needs and expectations of all parties involved.

In addition to taking more than one person's opinion into account, it is also important to take risks in order to grow and learn. Taking risks can be scary, but it is often necessary in order to achieve our goals and reach our full potential. For example, when applying for college, taking a risk and applying to a school that may be a stretch can lead to acceptance and the opportunity to pursue higher education.

In conclusion, taking more than one person's opinion when making a decision and taking risks are both important in order to achieve our goals and reach our full potential. By considering the opinions of others and taking calculated risks, we can make well-informed decisions and grow as individuals.",1,0.9947155,1,True
F3BFC265844A,"As an 8th grader, I think it's pretty cool to have a summer break in June and August instead of just March to May. I mean, who doesn't love more time off from school? But, I can also see why some people might not like it. Here are some pros and cons of changing the summer break:

Pros:

* More time to relax and recharge: Having a longer summer break means we can take our time to relax and recharge after a long school year. We can spend more time with our families, go on vacation, or just chill at home without feeling rushed.
* Better weather: Depending on where you live, having a longer summer break might mean better weather. I mean, who doesn't love sunny days and warm weather? It's perfect for outdoor activities like going to the beach, playing sports, or just hanging out with friends.
* More time for extracurricular activities: With a longer summer break, we might have more time to focus on our extracurricular activities like sports, music, or art. We can practice more, attend more competitions, or even start new hobbies.

Cons:

* Less time for learning: Some people might think that having a longer summer break means we'll forget what we learned during the school year. I mean, it's true that we won't be in school as much, but that doesn't mean we won't be learning anything. We can still read books, watch educational videos, or even take online courses to keep our minds sharp.
* Less time with family and friends: With a longer summer break, we might not get to see our families and friends as much. I mean, sure, we can still hang out with them, but it's not the same as having them around all the time.
* Less time for summer jobs: Some people might not like the idea of having a longer summer break because they rely on summer jobs to earn money. Without a spring break, they might not have as much time to work or save up for the next school year.

So, what can schools do to make up for the lost spring break? Here are some ideas:

* Add more breaks throughout the year: Instead of having one long summer break, schools could add more shorter breaks throughout the",1,0.9937045,1,True
B8624C2D465A,"The Importance of a B Average in Participating in Sports and Other Activities

As an 8th-grade student, I believe that having a B average or higher is crucial to participate in sports and other extracurricular activities. In this essay, I will discuss the benefits of having a B average to students, parents, and schools, and argue why students should be required to have a B average to be eligible for these activities.

Firstly, having a B average or higher is beneficial to students. Participating in sports and other extracurricular activities can help students develop important skills such as teamwork, leadership, and discipline. These skills are not only essential for success in sports but also in other areas of life, such as school and work. Additionally, participating in sports and other activities can help students build self-confidence and social skills, which can lead to better academic performance and overall well-being.

Secondly, parents also benefit from their children participating in sports and other activities. For parents, watching their children participate in sports and other activities can be a source of pride and joy. It can also provide an opportunity for parents to bond with their children and spend quality time together. Furthermore, research has shown that children who participate in sports and other activities are more likely to have positive relationships with their parents, which can lead to better mental health outcomes.

Lastly, schools also benefit from having students participate in sports and other activities. Participation in sports and other activities can help schools build a sense of community and school spirit. It can also provide an opportunity for schools to showcase their students' talents and achievements to the community. Additionally, research has shown that schools with higher participation rates in sports and other activities tend to have higher graduation rates and lower dropout rates.

In conclusion, I believe that students should be required to have a B average or higher to be eligible for sports and other activities. The benefits of participation in these activities are numerous and can have a positive impact on students, parents, and schools. By requiring a B average, schools can ensure that students are committed to their academic pursuits and are also engaged in extracurricular activities. It is essential that we prioritize the well-being of our students and provide them with the opportunities to develop important skills and build positive relationships.",1,0.9942478,1,True
a3405a91,"Limiting car usage can have several advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. This idea is supported by various articles, including ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky, and ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal. These articles highlight the benefits of reducing car dependency, such as improved air quality, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and increased physical activity.

One advantage of limiting car usage is the positive impact it has on the environment. Cars are one of the main contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, which are a significant cause of climate change. According to the article by Rosenthal, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By reducing car usage, we can significantly decrease these emissions and mitigate the harmful effects of climate change.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to improved air quality. In the article by Duffer, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to combat intense smog, resulting in a 60 percent decrease in congestion and a reduction in particulate matter per cubic meter. Similarly, in Bogota, the car-free day initiative led to a significant decrease in traffic jams and a reduction in smog levels, as mentioned in Selsky's article. These examples demonstrate how limiting car usage can contribute to cleaner and healthier air for citizens.

Another advantage of reducing car dependency is the promotion of physical activity and healthier lifestyles. When individuals rely less on cars, they are more likely to engage in alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, cycling, or using public transit. This increased physical activity can lead to numerous health benefits, including improved cardiovascular health, increased muscle tone, and weight management. As stated in Rosenthal's article, cities like Bogota have seen the construction of miles of bicycle paths, the creation of parks and sports centers, and the replacement of pitted sidewalks with smooth ones. These changes encourage an active lifestyle and contribute to the overall well-being of citizens.

In addition to environmental and health benefits, limiting car usage can also lead to more efficient transportation systems. In the article by Rosenthal, it is mentioned that Vauban, a car-free community in Germany, has stores placed within walking distance on a main street, promoting a compact and accessible layout. This approach reduces the need for large parking lots and encourages the use of public transportation. By adopting similar strategies, communities can improve traffic flow, reduce congestion, and make transportation more efficient overall.

In conclusion, there are numerous advantages to limiting car usage. This approach can lead to improved air quality, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, increased physical activity, and more efficient transportation systems. As highlighted in the articles, various initiatives and experiments worldwide have shown the positive impact of reducing car dependency. By encouraging alternative modes of transportation and promoting smart planning, individuals and communities can contribute to a healthier environment and enhanced quality of life.",1,0.96389437,1,True
ebf81462,"Limiting car usage has numerous advantages, both for individuals and for society as a whole. One of the main benefits is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. According to the passage set, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. By limiting car usage, we can significantly reduce these emissions and contribute to efforts to combat climate change.

In addition to reducing emissions, limiting car usage can also lead to improved public health. The passage set mentions that smog in Paris was so severe that it rivaled Beijing, one of the most polluted cities in the world. The poor air quality caused by car emissions can lead to respiratory problems and other health issues. By reducing car usage, we can improve air quality and create healthier environments for people to live in.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the potential for more efficient use of space. The passage set mentions the development of the Vauban community in Germany, where car ownership is allowed but limited parking spaces are provided. This results in more compact living spaces and frees up land that would have been used for parking. By reducing the need for parking spaces and encouraging the use of public transportation and walking, we can create more livable communities with less congestion and more green spaces.

Additionally, limiting car usage can have economic benefits. The passage set mentions that delivery companies in Paris complained of lost revenue during the driving ban, but exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. This shows that promoting alternative modes of transportation can encourage the adoption of more fuel-efficient vehicles and create economic opportunities in industries related to these vehicles.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to more equitable transportation options. The passage set mentions that car ownership started to decline in the United States two to three years before the economic downturn, indicating that something more fundamental was happening. This could be due to changing cultural attitudes towards cars and a desire for more sustainable and affordable transportation options.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can have numerous advantages, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, improved public health, more efficient use of space, economic benefits, and more equitable transportation options. As the passage set demonstrates, there are already successful examples of communities and cities implementing measures to limit car usage. By adopting similar measures and promoting alternative modes of transportation, we can create a more sustainable and livable future.",1,0.9911179,1,True
llama_70b_v1345,"I think that students would benefited from being able to attend classes from home throuigh distance learning. This is because it provides a flexible and accessible way for students to learn, especially for those who may have difficulty attending traditional in-person classes.

For example, some students may live in rural areas where schools are far away, or they may have health issues that make it hard for them to attend school every day. With distance learning, these students can still receive a quality education without having to worry about traveling or physically being present in a classroom.

Additionally, distance learning can provide students with more opportunities to learn at their own pace and on their own schedule. This can be especially helpful for students who may need extra time to understand a concept or who have different learning styles.

Furthermore, distance learning can also help students develop important skills such as time management, self-discipline, and technology literacy. These skills are essential for success in today's digital age and can help students in their future careers.

However, it is important to note that distance learning is not suitable for all students. Some students may struggle with the lack of face-to-face interaction with their teachers and peers, which can affect their motivation and engagement. Additionally, some students may not have access to the necessary technology or internet connection to participate in distance learning.

Overall, I believe that distance learning can be a valuable option for students who need flexibility in their education. It can provide them with more opportunities to learn and develop important skills, but it is not suitable for all students and schools should consider the potential challenges and limitations when implementing distance learning programs.",1,0.99331737,1,True

E03B6B157C32,"Introduction

Self-esteem is a crucial aspect of a person's life. It refers to the perception of oneself and one's abilities. Achieving goals is a significant way to build self-esteem. It shows that one is capable of achieving something and that they have the skills and determination to make it happen. On the other hand, self-esteem built through praise can be less effective as it may not necessarily show that one has the skills or abilities to achieve a goal. In this essay, I will explore the benefits of achieving goals for self-esteem and compare it to self-esteem built through praise.

Benefits of Achieving Goals for Self-Esteem

The first benefit of achieving goals for self-esteem is a sense of accomplishment. When one achieves a goal, they feel a sense of satisfaction and pride in themselves. This feeling of accomplishment can lead to a boost in self-esteem. For example, if a student sets a goal to get an A on a test and achieves it, they will feel a sense of accomplishment and pride in themselves. This can lead to an increase in their self-esteem.

The second benefit of achieving goals for self-esteem is the development of skills and abilities. When one sets a goal and works towards achieving it, they learn new skills and abilities. This can lead to a sense of competence and confidence in oneself. For example, if a student sets a goal to run a certain distance and achieves it, they will develop the skills and abilities necessary to run longer distances. This can lead to an increase in their self-esteem.

The third benefit of achieving goals for self-esteem is the development of determination and perseverance. When one sets a goal and works towards achieving it, they learn the importance of determination and perseverance. This can lead to a sense of self-discipline and motivation in oneself. For example, if a student sets a goal to read a certain number of books and achieves it, they will develop the determination and perseverance necessary to achieve their goal. This can lead to an increase in their self-esteem.

8FFDA5B9D359,"As an 8th grade student, I believe that attending classes from home would provide numerous benefits for students. Firstly, it would allow adults with responsibilities at home to attend class without worrying about leaving their children or elderly relatives unattended. This would provide a sense of peace of mind and ensure that students are able to attend class without any distractions.

Secondly, students with anxiety who don't perform well in a classroom would benefit from the flexibility of attending class from home. They would be able to attend class from a comfortable and familiar environment, which could help reduce their anxiety levels and improve their performance. Additionally, they would be able to attend class at their own pace, which would allow them to take breaks when they need to and review material as needed.

Lastly, attending classes from home would provide students with the benefit of being able to focus without distractions. This would allow them to fully engage with the material and improve their understanding of the subject matter. Furthermore, students would be able to create a study schedule that works for them and stick to it, which would help them stay on top of their work and achieve their academic goals.

In addition to these benefits, attending classes from home would provide students with the convenience of being able to do their class work anywhere. This would allow them to attend class from their own home, which would save them time and money on transportation. Furthermore, they would be able to attend class from a comfortable and familiar environment, which would help reduce their stress levels and improve their overall well-being.

In conclusion, attending classes from home would provide numerous benefits for students, including the ability to attend class from home, reduce anxiety levels, improve performance, and focus on the material. Furthermore, it would provide students with the convenience of being able to attend class from anywhere, which would help them achieve their academic goals and improve their overall well-being.

E19CE100743C,"Growth is something that is essential for everyone. It is the process of developing and expanding one's abilities and knowledge. There are different ways that we can grow, but the most effective way is by working hard, having confidence, and doing something.

Working hard is a crucial element of growth. It requires dedication and commitment to achieve our goals. When we work hard, we push ourselves to our limits and discover new capabilities that we didn't know we had. For example, when I started learning how to play the guitar, I had to practice every day for hours. It was challenging, but the more I practiced, the better I became. Eventually, I was able to perform in front of an audience, which gave me a sense of accomplishment and confidence.

Having confidence is also essential for growth. It is the belief in oneself and one's abilities. When we have confidence, we are more likely to take risks and try new things. For example, when I wanted to start my own business, I had to believe in myself and my ideas. I had to have the confidence to take the leap and invest my time and resources into it. It was scary, but it paid off because my business is now successful.

Finally, doing something is the most effective way to grow. It requires taking action and putting in the effort to achieve our goals. When we do something, we learn from our mistakes and improve our skills. For example, when I wanted to improve my writing skills, I started writing every day. I read books, took classes, and sought feedback from others. It was hard work, but it paid off because my writing has improved significantly.

On the other hand, relying on doing nothing and expecting results is dangerous. It is easy to assume that success will come to us without effort. However, this mindset is not realistic because growth requires hard work, dedication, and commitment. When we don't put in the effort, we miss out on the opportunity to learn and improve.

In conclusion, growth is essential for everyone. The most effective way to grow is by working hard, having confidence, and doing something. These methods require dedication and commitment, but the results are worth it. It is dangerous to rely on doing nothing and expecting results because growth requires effort and hard work.

7D2D5053D947,"Working with a group and working alone are two common approaches to completing tasks. Each approach has its own set of benefits and disadvantages. In this essay, I will compare and contrast the benefits of working with a group to working alone.

Working with a group has several advantages. Firstly, working with a group can help to increase productivity. When working with others, individuals can share ideas and work together to complete tasks. This can lead to more efficient and effective work. Additionally, working with a group can provide a sense of community and support. Being able to bounce ideas off of others and receive feedback can be helpful in improving one's work.

However, working with a group also has its disadvantages. One of the main disadvantages is that it can be difficult to find a group that is a good fit for one's needs. Not all groups are created equal, and some may be more productive or effective than others. Additionally, working with a group can be challenging if there are differences in work style or goals between group members.

Working alone has its own set of advantages. One of the main advantages is that it allows for greater flexibility and control over one's work. When working alone, individuals can work at their own pace and in their own way. This can lead to more efficient and effective work. Additionally, working alone can provide a sense of privacy and focus. Being able to work in a quiet and distraction-free environment can be helpful in improving one's work.

However, working alone also has its disadvantages. One of the main disadvantages is that it can be difficult to find feedback and support. When working alone, individuals may not have access to the same level of feedback and support as they would when working with a group. Additionally, working alone can be isolating and lonely. Being able to bounce ideas off of others and receive feedback can be helpful in improving one's work.

In conclusion, working with a group and working alone both have their own set of benefits and disadvantages. Working with a group can increase productivity and provide a sense of community and support, but it can be difficult to find a group that is a good fit and challenging to work with if there are differences in work style or goals.

He even designed flying machines, which is basically like a drone but way cooler.

And then there's Marie Curie, who discovered radium and polonium. Like, whoa! That's some serious science stuff right there. She won two Nobel Prizes for it, which is like, the highest honor you can get in science.

8087A7C3FCDA,"As an 8th grader, I strongly believe that implementing a rule that all high school students must take courses during the summer, evenings, or weekends to finish school faster would have significant implications on various groups of students, including immigrant students, teachers, and other students. While the intention behind this rule may be to help students graduate faster and reduce the burden on the education system, I argue that it would have several negative consequences.

Firstly, immigrant students would be significantly affected by this rule. Many immigrant students face language barriers and cultural differences, which can make it challenging for them to adapt to a fast-paced summer program. They may struggle to keep up with the coursework and could feel overwhelmed by the additional academic responsibilities. Moreover, immigrant students may have work or family obligations during the summer, which could make it difficult for them to attend evening or weekend classes. As a result, they may fall behind in their studies or miss out on important cultural experiences.

Secondly, teachers would also be impacted by this rule. Summer programs can be challenging to organize and manage, especially if the school lacks resources and support. Teachers would have to spend additional time preparing and delivering course materials, grading assignments, and providing individualized support to students. This could lead to burnout and stress for teachers, which could negatively impact their ability to provide high-quality instruction. Furthermore, teachers may not have the expertise or resources to teach specialized courses during the summer, which could result in a lack of diversity and depth in the curriculum.

Thirdly, other students would also be affected by this rule. Summer programs can be isolating and limit students' opportunities to engage in extracurricular activities, sports, and other hobbies. Students who excel in these areas are more likely to develop important life skills, such as teamwork, leadership, and time management. By forcing students to attend summer courses, they may miss out on these valuable experiences and fall behind in their personal development. Additionally, summer programs can be expensive, and many students may not be able to afford the costs associated with attending these programs. This could lead to inequality and a widening of the achievement gap between students from different socioeconomic backgrounds.",1,0.9940844,1,True
CB892FB55B59,"First impressions hold a lot of weight in our lives and can make or break the success of a relationship or interaction. Showing your best self right off the bat is incredibly important to ensure that the other person gains a positive first impression of you. 

First impressions matter because they are used to form initial judgments and opinions about someone which can shape future interactions. They can set the tone of a relationship, from romantic to professional, and signal your style of communication and how you prefer to interact with other people. They can be extremely hard to erase, so it's important to stay aware and make sure that the first impression you leave is a good one.

There are three good reasons why first impressions are almost impossible to change: 1) People tend to remember first impressions, making it nearly impossible to erase; 2) People are more prone to clinging to their initial judgments, thereby making it difficult to alter the impression even after further exposure; and 3) First impressions often shape the way people view the other person from then on, making it highly difficult for that person to rebuild the damaged reputation.

Hey, guys! Today we're talking about this super deep statement, ""Your character will be what yourself choose to make it.""

I mean, I know I definitely don't always make the best choices, but I guess that's just who I am, right?

So, on one hand, I think it's totally possible that the people we surround ourselves with can shape us into who we are. Like, if you're hanging out with a bunch of super responsible people, you might start to become more responsible too. Or if you're always around people who are super mean, you might start to be mean too. It's like, you're learning from the people around you and absorbing their traits and behaviors.

But on the other hand, I think we also have a say in who we want to be. Like, if you want to be a super responsible person, you can choose to do things that will help you become that way, even if your friends aren't. It's like, you have the power to make choices and shape your own character, even if you're influenced by others.

So, I think it's a mix of both. Like, we're definitely influenced by the people around us, but we also have the power to choose who we want to be and how we want to act. It's not just one or the other, it's both. And that's pretty cool, because it means we have the power to shape our own identities and become the people we want to be.

70E490A83717,"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that a longer winter break than a summer break is not a good idea for students. While it may seem like a great idea to have more time off, the reality is that it can negatively impact students' ability to retain information. In this essay, I will explore the reasons why a longer winter break can be detrimental to students' learning and provide evidence to support my argument.

Firstly, research has shown that students tend to forget more information during winter break than during summer break. This is because winter break is typically shorter than summer break, and students have less time to review and reinforce the material they learned before the break. In contrast, summer break provides students with more time to review and practice the material, which helps them retain it better.

Secondly, a longer winter break can disrupt students' academic progress. During the winter break, students may engage in activities that are not related to their studies, such as playing video games or watching movies. These activities can be fun and enjoyable, but they do not help students retain the information they learned in class. On the other hand, summer break provides students with more time to engage in academic activities, such as taking summer courses or doing research projects, which can help them stay on track academically.

Lastly, a longer winter break can also lead to a decrease in student motivation. During the winter break, students may feel like they are falling behind their peers, which can lead to feelings of frustration and discouragement. This can be particularly challenging for students who are already struggling academically. In contrast, summer break provides students with a fresh start, allowing them to catch up on any missed material and regain their motivation.

In conclusion, a longer winter break than summer break is not a good idea for students. Research has shown that students tend to forget more information during winter break than during summer break, which can disrupt their academic progress and decrease their motivation. While it may seem like a great idea to have more time off, the reality is that it can negatively impact students' ability to retain information. Therefore, it is important for schools to consider the potential negative consequences of a longer winter break and to provide students with adequate time to review and reinforce the material they learned before the break.",1,0.9939674,1,True

First of all, when you have a positive attitude, you're more likely to be motivated and driven. Like, if you're trying to learn something new, but you're not really into it, you're gonna be all like ""Ugh, this is so boring,"" and you're not gonna put in as much effort. But if you're like, ""Yeah, this is gonna be awesome! I can't wait to learn!"" then you're gonna be way more motivated and you're gonna do better.

And it's not just school stuff, either. Like, if you have a positive attitude, you're more likely to be successful in life. I mean, think about it. If you're always thinking negative thoughts, like ""I'm never gonna get that job,"" or ""I'm never gonna find someone to love me,"" then you're not gonna put in the effort to make those things happen. But if you're like, ""I can do this! I'm gonna work hard and get that job, and I'm gonna find someone amazing to be with,"" then you're way more likely to make those things happen.

Another thing is that having a positive attitude can help you deal with challenges. Like, if something bad happens, you're gonna be way more likely to get over it if you have a positive attitude. Instead of being all upset and sad, you can be like, ""Okay, this isn't the end of the world. I can get through this."" And then you can start working on finding a solution.

And finally, having a positive attitude can make you way more happy. Like, if you're always thinking positive thoughts, you're gonna be way more likely to feel good about yourself and your life. And who doesn't want to be happy?

Although I valued my own self-reliance, hearing experienced perspectives gave me valuable insight into what I should take into account when making this decision. This allowed me to make a more informed and confident decision.

At the same time, it's important to note that I still trusted my own instincts and ideas. I weighed the expert advice I received against my own opinion and decided which one was best for me.

In a job interview, a good first impression can land you the job. Employers often judge candidates based on their appearance, body language, and overall demeanor. A clean and professional appearance, good posture, and a confident attitude can all contribute to a positive first impression. This can lead to more opportunities for job interviews and eventually, a job offer.

In social settings, a good first impression can impact the way people interact with you. If you make a good first impression, people are more likely to approach you and engage in conversation. This can lead to new friendships and even potential romantic relationships. On the other hand, if you make a bad first impression, people may avoid you and limit their interactions with you.

A1BFCDA12FB1,"Decision-making is a crucial aspect of life, and it becomes even more important during the high school years. From choosing which classes to take to deciding which college to attend, young adults must make tough decisions that will impact their future. In this essay, I will analyze the role of decision-making in life from high school to 18 years old and provide three examples.

The first decision that many high school students must make is which classes to take. High school curriculums offer a variety of courses, and students must choose which ones will best prepare them for their future. For example, a student who is interested in pursuing a career in science may choose to take advanced science courses, while a student who wants to become an artist may choose to take art classes. These decisions can have a significant impact on a student's future, as they may determine which colleges they are accepted into and what careers they are able to pursue.

The second decision that high school students must make is which college to attend. This decision can be incredibly challenging, as there are so many factors to consider. Students must consider the cost of tuition, the location of the school, the programs offered, and the reputation of the school. Additionally, students must also consider their own personal preferences and goals. For example, a student who values a small, liberal arts school may choose to attend a smaller college, while a student who wants to pursue a career in business may choose a larger, more prestigious school.

The third decision that young adults must make is what to do after graduation. This decision can be even more challenging than choosing which college to attend, as there are so many options available. Some young adults choose to enter the workforce immediately, while others choose to pursue further education. For example, a student who is interested in pursuing a career in engineering may choose to attend graduate school to earn a master's degree, while a student who wants to become a teacher may choose to enter the workforce and start teaching right away.

In conclusion, decision-making plays a crucial role in life, and it becomes even more important during the high school years. From choosing which classes to take to deciding which college to attend and what to do after graduation, young adults must make tough decisions that will impact their future. By carefully considering their options and making informed decisions, young adults can set themselves up for success and achieve their goals.",1,0.99389017,1,True
F4D23BAA49AE,"Failure: The Unlikely Key to Success

As an 8th grader, I've learned that failure is not the end of the world. In fact, it's a crucial stepping stone towards success. Many people believe that failure is important in the pursuit of success because it helps us grow and become smarter. When we fail, we learn from our mistakes and figure out what didn't work, allowing us to try again with newfound knowledge.

One of the most famous examples of failure leading to success is Thomas Edison's invention of the light bulb. Edison failed over a thousand times before finally succeeding, but he never gave up. He said, ""I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."" Edison's determination and willingness to learn from his failures led to one of the most important inventions of the modern era.

Another example is J.K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter series. Rowling was rejected by 12 publishers before one finally agreed to publish her book. Today, the Harry Potter series is one of the most successful book series of all time. Rowling's persistence and ability to learn from her failures led to her ultimate success.

So, how can we use failure to stay enthusiastic while pursuing success? First, we need to embrace failure as a natural part of the learning process. Instead of getting discouraged when we fail, we should view it as an opportunity to learn and improve. Second, we need to be persistent and keep trying. As J.K. Rowling showed us, it can take a lot of attempts before we finally succeed. Finally, we need to be open to feedback and criticism. When we receive feedback, we can use it to improve and try again.

In conclusion, failure is not something to be feared or avoided. It's an important part of the pursuit of success. By embracing failure, being persistent, and being open to feedback, we can use failure to stay enthusiastic and keep working towards our goals. So, the next time you fail, remember Thomas Edison's words: ""I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won'",1,0.9933382,1,True
862ACD748291,"As an 8th grader, I believe it's important to have programs in place that help younger students mature and learn better behaviors. These programs can have a positive impact on the classroom environment and overall academic performance. For example, some schools have implemented mentorship programs where older students are paired with younger ones to help them navigate the challenges of school and provide guidance. This can help younger students feel more supported and confident, which can lead to improved academic performance.

Older students can also have a significant impact on younger ones in the classroom. They can serve as role models and peers, and their behavior can influence the behavior of younger students. For instance, if an older student is consistently disruptive or disrespectful, it can create a negative atmosphere in the classroom and discourage younger students from paying attention or participating. On the other hand, if an older student is well-behaved and engaged, it can encourage younger students to follow their lead and be more productive.

Younger students are also influenced by their peers, and this can sometimes lead to risky behavior. For example, if a younger student is hanging out with a group of older students who are engaging in risky behavior, such as drug use or bullying, they may be more likely to follow suit. This can have serious consequences, including academic problems and social issues. Therefore, it's important to have programs in place that promote positive behavior and provide support for younger students who may be struggling with peer pressure.

If younger students are exposed to bad influences, it can have serious consequences. For example, if a younger student is exposed to bullying or harassment, it can lead to low self-esteem, anxiety, and other mental health problems. Similarly, if a younger student is exposed to inappropriate content, such as violence or sexualization, it can have a lasting impact on their development and well-being. Therefore, it's important to have programs in place that protect younger students from these negative influences and provide them with a safe and supportive environment.

While students may appreciate the extra day to rest and recharge, teachers may struggle to keep up with the workload and maintain a consistent schedule. Additionally, the energy and resource savings that result from a school day off may not be as significant as they appear.

On one hand, taking one day off of school can provide students with much-needed rest and relaxation. This can lead to increased productivity and focus when they return to class, as well as improved mental and physical health. Moreover, a day off can give students a chance to catch up on any work they may have fallen behind on, or to pursue extracurricular activities that they may not have had time for otherwise.

However, taking one day off of school can also have negative consequences. Teachers may struggle to keep up with the workload that results from a school day off, such as grading papers, preparing for upcoming lessons, and communicating with students and parents. This can lead to increased stress and burnout, as well as a potential decrease in the quality of instruction.

Additionally, the energy and resource savings that result from a school day off may not be as significant as they appear.

llama_70b_v11086,"Libraries have been a crucial part of our society for centuries, serving as a hub for knowledge and information. However, with the advent of the digital age, the role of libraries has come under scrutiny. Some argue that libraries are no longer necessary, while others believe they are more important than ever. In this essay, I will argue for the continued importance of libraries, highlighting their unique value and the ways in which they continue to contribute to our communities.

Firstly, libraries provide a free and accessible source of information. With the rise of the internet, it's true that we have more access to information than ever before. However, not everyone has the luxury of having a computer or smartphone, and even for those who do, the sheer amount of information available can be overwhelming. Libraries provide a curated collection of resources, carefully selected to meet the needs of their community. This includes books, periodicals, databases, and other materials that might not be readily available online. Additionally, libraries offer trained librarians who can help patrons navigate the wealth of information and find exactly what they need.

Secondly, libraries are a vital resource for education. Schools and universities often have their own libraries, but public libraries also play a crucial role in supporting students. They provide a quiet and focused environment for studying, as well as access to resources that may not be available at school. Furthermore, libraries offer programs and services specifically designed to support students, such as tutoring, homework help, and study groups. These resources are especially important for students who may not have access to them otherwise.

Thirdly, libraries promote literacy and a love of reading. In an age where screen time is increasingly dominant, libraries continue to champion the joys of reading. They offer a wide range of books, from bestsellers to classics, as well as children's books and audiobooks. Libraries also host author talks, book clubs, and other events that encourage people to engage with literature. By promoting literacy and a love of reading, libraries help to create a more informed and empathetic society.

Another important role that libraries play is in supporting local communities. They serve as a hub for community events, hosting everything from author talks to children's storytime. Libraries also often partner with local organizations and businesses, providing a space for them to meet and collaborate. In this way, libraries help to foster a sense of community and connection, which is particularly important in today's digital age.

Finally, libraries are an important part of preserving our cultural heritage. They collect, catalog, and preserve materials that are important to our history and culture. This includes rare books, historical documents, and other materials that are valuable to researchers and scholars. By preserving our cultural heritage, libraries help to ensure that future generations will have access to the knowledge and information that has shaped our society.

In conclusion, libraries continue to play a vital role in our society, providing free and accessible information, supporting education, promoting literacy, supporting local communities, and preserving our cultural heritage. While the digital age has certainly changed the way we access information, it has not made libraries obsolete. In fact, libraries have adapted to the changing times, offering e-books, online resources, and other digital services that complement their traditional offerings. By continuing to support and utilize libraries, we can ensure that they continue to thrive and serve our communities for generations to come.",1,0.99376845,1,True

Have you ever dreamed of adventure? Of seeing the world in a way that few others have? Then I have the perfect opportunity for you - the Seagoing Cowboys program!

I recently read an article about a man named Luke who participated in this program, and let me tell you, it sounds amazing. As a cowboy, Luke was able to ride the waves and visit unique places that most people can only dream of. And you can too!

One of the reasons you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program is the adventure. Luke got to ride on a ship and help take care of the animals on board. He even got to visit places like Hawaii and Japan! Can you imagine the stories you'll be able to tell your friends and family?

Another reason to join is the experience. Luke learned so much about the world and himself through this program. He learned about different cultures and how to take care of animals in a new environment. You'll gain valuable skills and knowledge that will stay with you for the rest of your life.

But don't just take my word for it! In the article, Luke said that he loved the sense of freedom he felt while on the ship. He also mentioned that he learned to appreciate the little things in life, like a warm bed and a home-cooked meal. These are the kind of experiences that will shape you into a better person.

Working individually has its perks, especially when it comes to creative tasks like writing stories or drawing pictures. When I work alone, I can focus better and take my time to make sure my work is perfect. I don't have to worry about anyone else's opinions or ideas, so I can just concentrate on my own thoughts and ideas. Plus, I can work at my own pace, which is super important for me because I'm a bit of a perfectionist.

But, on the other hand, working in a group can be really helpful when we're doing something like a science experiment or a group project for school. When we work together, we can share our ideas and come up with something even better than what we could have done on our own. We can also help each other out when we get stuck or need extra support. It's like having a team of friends who are all working towards the same goal, which makes it more fun and exciting.

However, there are some potential pitfalls to working in a group. Sometimes, people can get distracted or not pull their weight, which can make the whole group suffer. Or, if everyone has different ideas, it can be hard to come to a consensus and make decisions. It's like, we all want to do things our own way, but we have to find a way to work together and compromise.

So, in conclusion, both working individually and in a group have their pros and cons. It really depends on the situation and what we're trying to achieve. If it's something creative or something that requires a lot of focus, working alone might be better. But, if it's something that needs a lot of brainstorming and collaboration, working in a group is probably the way to go. Thanks for reading, Mrs. Johnson!",1,0.99413353,1,True

55652348,"Limiting car usage offers numerous advantages that can greatly benefit both individuals and society as a whole. This approach not only helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and alleviate air pollution, but it also promotes healthier and more sustainable lifestyles. Several examples from around the world demonstrate the positive impact of limiting car usage.

One such example is the town of Vauban in Germany, where residents have given up their cars. Streets in the town are completely car-free, except for a few essential thoroughfares. As a result, 70% of families in Vauban do not own cars, and 57% of residents sold their cars to move to this car-free community. The absence of cars has created a peaceful environment, with the swish of bicycles and the chatter of children replacing the noise of car engines. Vauban is part of a growing trend in Europe and the United States to separate suburban life from car use, as a component of ""smart planning.""

The advantages of limiting car usage extend beyond improved quality of life. Cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. In Europe, passenger cars contribute to 12% of greenhouse gas emissions, and in some car-intensive areas in the United States, this figure can reach up to 50%. By reducing car usage, we can drastically reduce these emissions and mitigate the impact of climate change. Additionally, limiting car usage can also help address air pollution issues, which are particularly severe in major cities like Paris. Implementing driving bans, like the one enforced in Paris due to smog, can significantly reduce congestion and improve air quality.

Promoting alternative forms of transportation, such as walking, cycling, and public transportation, is an important aspect of limiting car usage. Initiatives like car-free days, as seen in Bogota, Colombia, encourage people to use alternative methods of transportation, leading to a significant decrease in traffic congestion. Public transportation systems play a vital role in reducing car dependence and promoting accessibility. Efforts are being made worldwide to make suburbs more compact and suitable for walking, with stores located within walking distance rather than being distant and car-dependent. These smart planning strategies aim to create communities that are less reliant on cars, helping to reduce traffic congestion, improve air quality, and promote physical activity and healthier lifestyles.

The decrease in car usage is not solely attributed to economic factors, such as the recession. Sociologists suggest that cultural shifts, driven by factors like urban renewal, advancements in technology, and changing preferences of younger generations, play a significant role in the decline. Young people, in particular, are becoming less interested in car ownership and prioritize alternative forms of transportation. As the next generation begins to make lifestyle choices that align with sustainability and environmental consciousness, the decline in car culture is expected to continue.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers numerous advantages, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, decreased traffic congestion, and promotion of healthier and more sustainable lifestyles. Examples from around the world, such as Vauban in Germany, Paris in France, and Bogota in Colombia, demonstrate the positive impact of limiting car usage in creating more livable and environmentally-friendly communities. By embracing alternative forms of transportation and implementing smart planning strategies, we can pave the way for a future with reduced car dependence and a healthier planet.",1,0.9830072,1,True

However, playing a sport as a student also has its own unique set of advantages and disadvantages. On the positive side, playing a sport can improve physical fitness and help students develop important life skills such as teamwork, communication, discipline, and goal setting. Additionally, participating in a team sport can provide students with a unique outlet for stress relief, an opportunity to make friends, and even a sense of accomplishment from winning games or tournaments. 

On the other hand, playing a sport can be time-consuming and expensive. In addition to the cost of equipment, uniforms, and fees associated with joining a team, students may need to invest a great deal of time into practices, games, and travel.

7AC357DAA5D7,"Positive attitude plays a crucial role in achieving success in life. The way we think and approach challenges shapes our outcomes. Research has shown that people with positive attitudes are more likely to achieve their goals and lead happy lives.

In everyday life, having a positive attitude can help us navigate through challenges and obstacles. When we face problems, we often have the choice to either see them as opportunities or threats. People with a positive attitude see challenges as opportunities to learn and grow, while those with a negative attitude view them as obstacles that will only lead to failure.

In the workplace, a positive attitude can help employees work more efficiently and effectively. When we have a positive attitude, we are more motivated to achieve our goals, and we are more likely to work collaboratively with others. On the other hand, a negative attitude can lead to conflicts and a lack of productivity.

During times of need, having a positive attitude is especially important. When we face difficult situations, such as illness or financial hardship, a positive attitude can help us cope and find solutions. People with a positive attitude are more likely to seek help and support, while those with a negative attitude may feel hopeless and helpless.

A negative attitude can prevent one from prospering in many ways. When we have a negative attitude, we tend to focus on the negative aspects of a situation, which can lead to feelings of anxiety and stress. This can affect our physical and mental health, making it harder for us to achieve our goals. Additionally, a negative attitude can lead to poor decision-making, as we may overlook important information or opportunities.

6ed17933,"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can offer several advantages to both individuals and communities. The concept of reducing car dependency and promoting alternative forms of transportation is gaining momentum around the world. This approach, known as ""smart planning,"" aims to create more sustainable and livable communities. By limiting car usage, we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, enhance public health, and create more vibrant and accessible neighborhoods.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the positive impact it can have on the environment. Cars are a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions, particularly in car-intensive areas. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and in some areas of the United States, that number can reach up to 50 percent. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can help mitigate the effects of climate change and work towards meeting emission reduction targets.

Additionally, limiting car usage can improve air quality, particularly in urban areas. The smog levels in cities like Paris and Bogota have reached alarming levels, negatively impacting public health. By promoting alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, cycling, and public transit, we can reduce air pollution and create cleaner and healthier environments for everyone.

Apart from the environmental benefits, limiting car usage can also have social and economic advantages. By creating car-free or car-reduced communities, we can encourage social interaction and community engagement. Streets become safer for pedestrians and cyclists, leading to a more active and connected community. Access to public transportation is also improved, making it easier for people to travel to work, school, and social events.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the potential for cost savings. Owning and maintaining a car can be expensive, with costs including fuel, insurance, parking, and maintenance. By relying on alternative forms of transportation, individuals can save money on these expenses and allocate their resources towards other needs. Furthermore, car-free or car-reduced communities often experience increased property values due to their more attractive and sustainable nature.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can bring numerous benefits to individuals and communities. It can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, enhance public health, and create more vibrant and accessible neighborhoods. By promoting alternative forms of transportation and adopting smart planning strategies, we can create a more sustainable and livable future for everyone.",1,0.99337995,1,True
CF45352F8424,"Attitude is often described as “the lens through which we view the world.” Indeed, having a positive attitude can significantly improve our daily lives, from the way we approach the workplace to the way we handle relationships. It is no wonder that so many prominent figures throughout history have highlighted the importance of developing a positive outlook—including Benjamin Franklin, who famously said, “The Constitution only guarantees the American people the right to pursue happiness. You have to catch it yourself.” 

What makes a positive attitude the key to success is its role in personal motivation. For example, a study from the University of Michigan showed that students with a positive attitude about taking a tough math course achieved better results than students with negative attitudes, regardless of their level of intelligence or King’s College London tested the effect of “positive thinking” on athletes and found that successfully imagining the act of completing a task can increase motivation.

In our professional and personal lives, having a positive attitude can open the doors of opportunity. This is because positive thinking leads to optimism, which can improve quality of work, thus making us more appealing to employers or allowing us to achieve our goals. 

Positive attitude is undoubtedly a key to success. With resilience and conviction, any individual can develop the necessary skills and knowledge to become successful, but it is the attitude that makes them shine. A positive attitude can show employers and colleagues the state of our mental health and resilience towards challenges, making it easier for us to take the steps towards a brighter future.",1,0.9935847,1,True
llama_70b_v1581,"I think dress codes are beneficial to the school environment. One reason is that it helps kids focus on their school work instead of being distracted by what other people are wearing. Like, if someone is wearing a really short skirt or a shirt with a bad word on it, it can be really distracting and make it hard for other kids to pay attention. By having a dress code, it helps kids to focus on their work and not be distracted by what other people are wearing.

Another reason is that dress codes can help prevent bullying. If everyone is wearing the same kind of clothes, then no one will stand out and be made fun of. Like, if someone is wearing a weird shirt or pants, they might get teased by other kids. But if everyone is wearing the same uniform, then no one will get teased and everyone will be treated equally.

Also, dress codes can help create a sense of community and equality. When everyone is wearing the same uniform, it shows that everyone is equal and that no one is better than anyone else. It also helps kids to feel like they belong to a community, like they are all part of the same team.

But, some people might say that dress codes are bad because they restrict kids from expressing themselves. They might say that kids should be able to wear whatever they want and express their individuality. But, I think that kids can still express themselves in other ways, like through their personality and their work.

6186246910E1,"Hey, so like, I know this might be a pretty controversial topic, but I think students should be able to graduate in three years instead of four. I mean, think about it, four years is a looong time to be in school, especially when you're like, 13 or 14 years old.

First of all, let's talk about the benefits of graduating early. For one thing, it would save families a ton of money on tuition fees. My parents are always stressing about how expensive college is, and I'm like, ""Dude, if we could just graduate early, we could save so much money!"" And think about it, if we're done with school earlier, we could start working or pursuing our passions sooner. That would be like, super cool.

Another thing is, when you're in school for four years, you can get a little bit burnt out. Like, I know I'm only in 8th grade right now, but I'm already feeling the stress of school. If we could graduate early, we could take a break and focus on other things we're interested in, like sports or music or volunteering. That would be way more fulfilling than just sitting in a classroom all day.

And let's not forget about the academic benefits. When you graduate early, you can start college earlier too. That means you can get a head start on your degree and finish it faster. That's like, a total win-win situation. Plus, you'll have more time to focus on your studies and get better grades.

Now, I know some people might be like, ""But what about the social aspect of school? Won't you miss out on all the fun stuff?"" And yeah, I get that. But think about it, if we graduate early, we can still hang out with our friends and have fun, we just won't have to do it in the context of school. We can like, create our own fun stuff and make our own memories.

9000217714BE,"Hey, I'm just a regular 8th grader, so bear with me on this essay! 😅

So, the task is to research current policy for school sports and compare it to potential new policy. I'm gonna give my thoughts on the pros and cons of the new policy from the perspective of students, teachers, and the school.

First off, let's talk about the current policy. Right now, our school has a pretty cool policy where we can join any sport we want, as long as we have the grades and attendance to back it up. It's pretty chill, and I think it's great that we have so many options. Like, I'm on the basketball team, and it's a blast! I get to hang out with my friends, stay active, and learn some new skills. Plus, it looks good on college apps and stuff. 😅

But, there are some downsides too. Sometimes, I feel like the grades and attendance requirements are a bit too strict. I know some people who are really good at sports but not so great in school, and they can't join because they don't have the grades. It doesn't seem fair, you know? And sometimes, the coaches can be super strict too. Like, they might make us run extra laps if we mess up a play or something. It can be pretty frustrating.

Now, let's talk about the potential new policy. So, some people are suggesting that we should have a more inclusive policy where anyone can join a sport, regardless of their grades or attendance. I can see why this would be a good idea. It would be super cool to have more diversity on the teams, and it would be more inclusive for people who might not have the best grades. Plus, it would be a great way to promote teamwork and camaraderie.

But, there are some downsides to this too. Like, if everyone can join a sport, then maybe the competitiveness of the games would go down. And some people might not take it as seriously, which could be bad for their skills and for the team as a whole.

Subject: The Importance of Keeping the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. As a concerned citizen and constituent of [State], I am writing to express my support for keeping the Electoral College in our presidential elections. While there are valid arguments for both sides, I believe that the Electoral College system is essential for maintaining fair and balanced elections in our great nation, ensuring that the voices of all citizens are heard and protecting the interests of smaller states.

The Electoral College, as established by our founding fathers in the Constitution, serves as a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and a popular vote of qualified citizens. It consists of 538 electors, with each state having a number of electors equal to its Congressional delegation. This system ensures that each state has a fair representation in the presidential election, preventing larger states from overpowering smaller ones.

One of the main advantages of the Electoral College is the certainty of outcome it provides. By having electors vote for the President, rather than a direct popular vote, we avoid the risk of disputed outcomes. The winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote, allowing for a more decisive result. In contrast, a direct popular vote could lead to recounts and potential disputes, as seen in the 2000 election. The Electoral College minimizes the chance of such scenarios and provides a clear winner.

Additionally, the Electoral College ensures that the President is everyone's president. Candidates need to have trans-regional appeal and cannot solely rely on support from one region. This prevents presidents from neglecting the interests and concerns of certain regions, as they would be representing all states and not just the ones they won in the popular vote. By requiring candidates to seek votes from across the country, the Electoral College promotes better representation and a broader understanding of the diverse needs of our communities.

Another important advantage of the Electoral College is its encouragement of campaign focus in swing states. Candidates dedicate their resources and efforts to states where the election outcome is uncertain. This ensures that the needs and concerns of these diverse states are addressed, as swing states are more likely to receive attention from candidates. Without the Electoral College, candidates would focus solely on highly populated areas and ignore the smaller states, effectively silencing the voices of millions of Americans in less populated regions.

Furthermore, the Electoral College balances the political weight of large and small states. The mal-apportionment of the Senate already grants smaller states equal representation, and the Electoral College complements this by giving each state a minimum of three electors. This ensures that larger states do not completely dominate the election process, preserving the interests and influence of smaller states. It acts as a check to prevent the tyranny of the majority, ensuring that all states have a say in the election of our President.

Lastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast. It provides a clear winner, preventing complicated and potentially lengthy run-off elections that could further extend the already long presidential election process. By streamlining the election process, the Electoral College allows for a more efficient selection of our President.

In conclusion, Senator, the Electoral College is a vital component of our democratic system. It guarantees fair representation for all states, encourages trans-regional appeal in candidates, protects the interests of smaller states, and avoids the complications of run-off elections. While there are rightful criticisms surrounding this system, it is important to consider the practical advantages it offers. I urge you to keep the Electoral College intact and protect the interests of our great nation.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I trust that you will consider my viewpoint and make decisions that benefit the welfare of our state and country as a whole. If you require any further information or would like to discuss this issue in more detail, please do not hesitate to contact me.

89863E1AF982,"Making a good first impression is incredibly important for many aspects of life. People are often judged by those around them on first impression, and those impressions are lasting. It is not possible to “go back in time” and change a bad first impression; therefore, it is critical that people make sure to leave a positive and lasting impression the first time around. 

Not creating a successful first impression can mean losing important opportunities in life. For example, let’s say an individual is meeting a potential business partner or investor for the first time. If that person neglects to dress for the occasion, appearing unprofessional and unprepared, that could be a deal breaker in terms of convincing the other person to invest in the business. Not appearing to be someone of value and positive standing can quickly result in the loss of a lucrative opportunity. 

Not only does a bad first impression lead to missed opportunity, but it can also lead to getting into serious trouble. Let’s say someone makes a first impression of being lazy and uninterested in a job. That could be grounds for termination if the person is not able to make a sufficient case for themselves in the future. People need to be aware that bad first impressions can have serious consequences, even if they think they can work their way out of the initial poor opinion later. 

In conclusion, making a good first impression is essential. People cannot go back and change a poor first impression, so it is key to make sure to leave a strong and positive one the first time. Neglecting to create a successful first impression can lead to major missed opportunities, or even worse, trouble further down the line.",1,0.994166,1,True

One of the most significant benefits of technology is the ability to connect with people from all over the world. With the rise of social media, video conferencing, and instant messaging, people can now communicate with friends, family, and colleagues from anywhere in the world.

One of the most important aspects of technology is its ability to connect people in an emergency. With the advent of 911, people can now call for help in a matter of seconds. 911 is a universal emergency number that is recognized in every country in the world, and it has saved countless lives. For example, in the United States, 911 has been in operation for over 50 years and has helped to save millions of lives.

llama_70b_v1118,"I think we should definitely switch from fossil fuels to renewable energy. First of all, fossil fuels are finite, which means they will eventually run out. This means that we have to find new ways to power our homes, cars, and businesses. Renewable energy is a great option because it's sustainable and won't run out.

Another reason we should switch is because fossil fuels are really bad for the environment. They release harmful greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide, into the air which contribute to climate change. Climate change is causing lots of problems, like sea levels rising, more frequent natural disasters, and really bad weather. Renewable energy, on the other hand, doesn't release these harmful gases, making it a much cleaner source of energy.

One example of a renewable energy source is solar power. Solar power uses the sun's energy to generate electricity. It's a great option because the sun is always shining (well, almost always) and it's free! We can put solar panels on our homes and businesses to generate electricity and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.

Another example is wind power. Wind power uses wind turbines to generate electricity. It's a clean source of energy and it's getting cheaper and cheaper. We can build wind turbines in areas with strong winds and use the electricity to power our homes and businesses.

I know some people might argue that renewable energy is too expensive, but the cost is actually decreasing as technology improves. Plus, the cost of fossil fuels is going up and up. In the long run, renewable energy will be cheaper and better for the environment.

In conclusion, we should definitely switch from fossil fuels to renewable energy. It's sustainable, cleaner, and will save us money in the long run. We need to take action now to protect the environment and ensure a bright future for our planet.

The first experiment involved the interior of a frog. I wanted to learn more about the frog's respiratory system and how it works. To do this, I dissect a frog and examine its lungs. I found that the frog's lungs were divided into two halves, and each half was made up of tiny air sacs called alveoli. These alveoli were filled with small blood vessels that allowed oxygen to be transported from the air into the bloodstream.

In addition to the alveoli, I also found a network of small tubes called bronchioles that connected the alveoli to the frog's trachea. The bronchioles were lined with mucus, which helped to trap particles and prevent them from entering the lungs.

Overall, this experiment taught me a lot about the frog's respiratory system and how it works. It was fascinating to see the intricate structure of the lungs and how they were designed to efficiently transport oxygen to the rest of the body.

The second experiment involved a flashlight and a liquid. I wanted to learn more about how light behaves when it passes through different liquids. To do this, I filled a glass with different liquids (such as water, oil, and mercury) and shone a flashlight through each one.

As I expected, the light passed through the water with no problem. However, when I shone the light through the oil, I noticed that it refracted (bent) the light. This was because oil has a higher refractive index than water, which means that it slows down the speed of light as it passes through it.

When I shone the light through the mercury, I noticed that it reflected (bounced) the light. This was because mercury has a high reflective index, which means that it reflects light very efficiently.

Overall, this experiment taught me a lot about how light behaves when it passes through different liquids. It was fascinating to see how the properties of the liquids affected the way the light was refracted or reflected.

CE214B0C2CB6,"The statement ""Your character will be what yourself choose to make it"" is a powerful idea that is worth considering. It implies that each person is ultimately in control of their character and behavior, and it is their decisions that determine what kind of person they become. However, it is important to acknowledge that this view ignores the fact that people are heavily influenced by those around them, and their environment can have a significant impact on their character. 

For example, a person may be raised in a household where they see particular behaviors modeled, either positive or negative. This can have a lasting effect on their character, as the things they observe can shape their beliefs and values. Additionally, those around them can pressure them to act in certain ways, and it often requires strength to defy these pressures and stay true to one’s values.

Overall, it is important to remember that while people should strive to be in control of the person they want to be, they must also recognize that the environment they live in can influence their character significantly. It is possible to be strongly impacted by those around us, both positively and negatively, and it is our decisions that will determine whether we are actively resisting or submitting to these influences.",1,0.9946786,1,True
AC0AAA109FA6,"As students, it is our responsibility to give back to our community. This is why I advocate for the requirement to perform community service in elementary school. Community service not only builds character and a sense of responsibility but also provides meaningful life experiences that will stay with us as we grow and pursue our goals. 

In a reasonable amount of time, students can volunteer at a shelter, help with food drives, participate in neighborhood clean-up days, or mentor younger students. Community service teaches us important values such as cooperation, teamwork, and selflessness. It helps us develop leadership skills and a more comprehensive view of our place in the world.

For example, in a small village in India, a group of elementary students got together to start a compost bin project. They created a composting system that was easier to maintain and more effective than anything the village had previously done. Through their actions, the students showed leadership and inspired others to help make their community a better place. This real-life example proves that community service not only benefits the community but also strengthens the lives of elementary school students who take part in it.

In conclusion, I believe that making community service a requirement within the school curriculum is an important step in teaching our youth invaluable lessons that will help them become positive contributors to our society.

A positive attitude is a mindset that enables us to see the good in every situation and believe that we can overcome challenges. In contrast, a negative attitude is a mindset that focuses on the negative aspects of a situation and believes that we cannot overcome challenges.

One of the primary benefits of having a positive attitude is that it helps us build stronger relationships with others. When we have a positive attitude, we are more approachable, empathetic, and understanding. We are more likely to listen to others, offer support, and show appreciation for their efforts. This helps us build trust, respect, and rapport with others, which are essential for maintaining healthy relationships. On the other hand, when we have a negative attitude, we tend to be more critical, judgmental, and dismissive of others. This can lead to misunderstandings, conflicts, and the breakdown of relationships.

Another benefit of having a positive attitude is that it helps us solve problems more effectively. When we have a positive attitude, we are more optimistic, resourceful, and creative in finding solutions to problems. We are more likely to see opportunities where others see obstacles, and we are more motivated to take action and make things happen. This helps us overcome challenges, learn from mistakes, and grow as individuals. In contrast, when we have a negative attitude, we tend to be more pessimistic, passive, and resigned to failure. This can lead to procrastination, avoidance, and the perpetuation of problems.

The difference between positive and negative attitudes is significant, and it can have a profound impact on our lives. Positive attitudes are characterized by optimism, resilience, and a belief in our ability to succeed. They are associated with better mental health, higher levels of happiness, and greater life satisfaction. Negative attitudes, on the other hand, are characterized by pessimism, cynicism, and a belief in our inability to succeed.

Through these experiences, I have come to understand the benefits of taking part in such activities, as well as the potential downfalls and strategies for managing disagreements or arguments.

One of the most significant benefits of participating in educational activities is the positive impact they have on learning. By working together with others, we are able to share ideas, collaborate on projects, and learn from one another. This not only enhances our understanding of the subject matter, but also helps us develop important skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication.

In addition to the learning benefits, educational activities also provide opportunities for socializing and making friends. By working together on projects and participating in group discussions, we are able to connect with others who share similar interests and values. This not only makes the learning experience more enjoyable, but also helps us build important social skills that will serve us well in the future.

However, despite the many benefits of participating in educational activities, there are also potential downfalls to be aware of. For example, disagreements and arguments can arise when individuals have different opinions or approaches to a particular task. It is important to be aware of these potential conflicts and to have strategies in place for managing them.

One effective strategy for managing disagreements is to encourage open and respectful communication. By actively listening to others and expressing our own thoughts and ideas in a clear and concise manner, we can help to foster a positive and productive group dynamic. It is also important to be open to compromise and to be willing to consider alternative viewpoints.

Another strategy for managing disagreements is to focus on the task at hand rather than getting bogged down in personal differences. By keeping the goal of the activity in mind and working together to achieve it, we can overcome any obstacles that may arise and ultimately succeed in our endeavors.

In conclusion, participating in educational activities with a group of people can have numerous benefits, including enhanced learning, socializing, and making friends. However, it is important to be aware of potential downfalls and to have strategies in place for managing disagreements or arguments. By encouraging open and respectful communication, being open to compromise, and focusing on the task at hand, we can ensure that our group experiences are positive and productive.",1,0.99461305,1,True
llama_70b_v1108,"Hi fellow citizes! Today im gonna tell you why we should limit car usage. Cars are a big polution maker and they make our air dirty. Its not good for our health. We should use public transportation like buses and trains. They are way better for enviroment. Plus they are cheeper then cars! You can also ride bikes or walk. Its good exercise and its good for earth.

Another reason we should limit cars is because they make traffic. Traffic is bad. It makes us late for work and school. It also makes us stressed out. We don't want to be stressed out! We want to be happy and healthy.

Cars also use alot of energy. Energy is important but we cant just use it all up. We need to save it for the future. We can save energy by using public transportation, biking, or walking. These are all great ways to get around without using so much energy.

Some people might say that cars are conveniant. They are right, cars are conveniant. But they are not worth the polution and traffic. We can use other ways to get around that are just as conveniant. Like i said before, public transportation, biking, and walking are all great options. They might take a little longer but they are better for us and the earth.

In conclusion, limiting car usage is a great idea. It will help keep our air clean, reduce traffic, save energy, and make us healthier. We should all try to use public transportation, biking, and walking more often. Thanks for reading!",1,0.007364745,0,False

AADAFDCD9944,"School administrators have proposed extending the school day by two hours and having a four day school week. If implemented, this change could have several potential consequences for students, teachers, and schools. 

First and foremost, most students would likely oppose this idea due to the extended time spent in school each day, along with the weekends no longer being a block of days to catch up on assignments and prepare for tests. The extra time might place more stress on students, negatively affecting their mental health. In addition, this might lead to more absences from school due to fatigue and poorer academic performance as a result of the extended day. 

For teachers, this type of schedule could mean that more planning and preparation for classes would need to be done to make the two extra hours meaningful and worthwhile. This additional planning might pose a challenge for some teachers and could lead to burnout. Furthermore, the additional time for instruction might lead to more frequent lesson plans and the need for additional grading and feedback from the teachers. 

In terms of schools, implementing a four-day week and extended day schedule could have some potential logistical issues. Schools would need to ensure that enough buses are available for the extended route times, along with the management of cafeteria routines, student drop-off and pick-up times, and the coordination of sports and extracurricular activities. 

Overall, extending the school day to two more hours and having a four day school week could have significant consequences for students, teachers, and schools. Although there could be some advantages to this type of scheduling change, school administrators need to carefully consider all of the potential issues before moving forward.",1,0.9928485,1,True
ECB127F00953,"Honesty is a hotly debated topic, with strong arguments on both sides. On one side, many people argue that honesty is always the best policy. They point to examples such as the importance of developing trust in relationships, companies, and governments. Honesty also shows respect for others; by being honest, we demonstrate that we recognize and value their feelings, considerations, and rights. The consequences of not being honest can also be significant. People often experience feelings of guilt, deceit, and shame resulting from dishonesty, leading to a sense of internal unrest. On the other side of the debate, some claim that there can be drawbacks to being too honest. This could include the potential for hurting others’ feelings or causing distress due to being overly blunt. Being excessively honest could also strain relationships, damage one’s reputation, and create an environment of mistrust.

9F7E189A2DCF,"It is often said that first impressions are everything, and they can have a powerful influence on how we view another person. But is it always the case that first impressions are accurate? The truth is, first impressions can change after we get to know a person. This has been supported both by personal experiences and factual evidence.

On a personal level, I have found that sometimes my first impressions of someone have proven to be inaccurate after getting to know them better. A few years ago, I met someone who immediately rubbed me the wrong way. On the surface, they seemed cocky and rude. But as I got to know them better, this person eventually became one of my closest friends. It turns out, they were actually quite humble and kind, and I was glad that I decided to give them a chance despite my first impressions.

This idea has also been supported by academic research. In a 2012 study, researchers asked participants to watch brief videos of strangers and form an impression. The study found that the more information participants had about the persons in the video, the more their first impression changed. These findings suggest that the more interaction we have with someone, the more our initial impression of them may change.

Overall, it appears that first impressions are not always an accurate indicator of someone's personality or character. This is why it is important to look beyond the surface of any person and get to know them better. All too often, a knee-jerk reaction to a first impression can lead to judgments that are not entirely valid and might be better described as an educated guess.",1,0.99368334,1,True
falcon_180b_v1_163,"Zoos have been a subject of controversy for quite some time now. Some people argue that these institutions play a critical role in conservation and education, while others believe that they should be shut down. In my opinion, zoos should continue to operate.

Firstly, zoos provide a safe haven for endangered species. With deforestation and other human activities threatening the existence of several animal species, zoos offer a sanctuary where these animals can live without fear of extinction. For instance, the black rhino was on the brink of extinction, but thanks to zoos' breeding programs, their numbers have increased over the years. Therefore, by preserving these species, zoos contribute significantly to biodiversity conservation.

Secondly, zoos serve as educational platforms where people can learn about different animal species. They offer an opportunity for individuals, especially children, to see and interact with animals they would otherwise not encounter in their daily lives. This exposure fosters empathy and appreciation for wildlife, which could lead to more support for conservation efforts. Moreover, zoos often conduct research on animal behavior and biology, which contributes to our understanding of these species and informs conservation strategies.

However, opponents argue that keeping animals in captivity is cruel and unnatural. While this may be true in some cases, modern zoos strive to provide environments that closely mimic the animals' natural habitats. Additionally, many zoos participate in reintroduction programs, where animals born in captivity are gradually introduced into the wild. An example is the California condor, whose population was reduced to just 27 individuals in the 1980s. Today, thanks to successful breeding programs in zoos and subsequent reintroduction, their numbers have grown to over 400.

In conclusion, despite the criticisms against them, zoos play a vital role in both education and conservation. They provide a safe haven for endangered species, offer unique learning opportunities, and contribute valuable research to our understanding of wildlife. Therefore, rather than calling for their closure, we should focus on improving regulations and standards to ensure that they provide the best possible care for the animals.",1,0.9933513,1,True
8476588805D9,"Career pathways are an important aspect of a student's life. It is essential for students to understand the different options available to them and to choose the one that best suits their interests and skills. In addition to choosing a career path, it is also important for students to gain practical experience in their chosen field. This can be achieved through partnerships with local companies.

One way to help students become aware of their interests is through career counseling. Career counselors can provide students with information about different career paths, as well as help them assess their skills and interests. This can be done through assessments, interviews, and other tools. By understanding their interests, students can make more informed decisions about their career path.

Partnerships with local companies can provide students with valuable opportunities to gain experience in their chosen field. These partnerships can take many forms, including internships, apprenticeships, and mentorship programs. Through these programs, students can gain hands-on experience in their chosen field, learn about the work that companies do, and network with professionals in their industry.

In addition to providing practical experience, partnerships with local companies can also benefit students in other ways. For example, these partnerships can provide students with valuable networking opportunities, which can be helpful when they graduate and enter the workforce.

B32F41984B27,"Online classes have become a popular option for students in recent years, offering flexibility and convenience for those who need it. However, there are both benefits and drawbacks to this format, and it's important to consider these when deciding whether or not to offer classes online.

For high school students, online classes can be a great option for those who are academically advanced and want to challenge themselves. These students can take advanced courses that may not be available at their school, or they can take courses at their own pace. This can help them get ahead and prepare for college. On the other hand, students who need extra help with their classes may struggle in an online format. They may not have the same level of support and resources as they would in a traditional classroom, which can make it harder for them to succeed.

For middle school students, online classes can be a good option for those who need more flexibility in their schedules. For example, students who have extracurricular activities or sports may find it easier to fit in schoolwork around their schedules. However, middle school students may also struggle with the lack of face-to-face interaction and socialization that comes with online classes.

For college students, online classes can be a great option for those who have busy schedules or who live far away from the university. They can take classes from the comfort of their own homes and at their own pace, which can be especially helpful for working professionals or those with families. However, college students may also miss out on the social and networking opportunities that come with traditional classes.

Overall, I think that offering online classes can be a good option for students who need flexibility and convenience, but it's important to consider the potential drawbacks as well. For example, students may struggle with the lack of face-to-face interaction and support, and they may not have the same level of accountability as they would in a traditional classroom.

In my opinion, classes should be offered online, but with some restrictions. For example, students should be required to attend a certain number of in-person classes each semester to ensure that they are getting the social and academic support they need. Additionally, online classes should be designed to be interactive and engaging, with features like virtual labs and group projects to encourage collaboration and interaction.

llama_70b_v1821,"The legalization of marijuana is a highly debated topic that has sparked intense discussions among lawmakers, health professionals, and the general public. While some argue that it should be legalized, others firmly believe that it should remain illegal. In my opinion, the legalization of marijuana is a step in the right direction.

One of the primary reasons for legalizing marijuana is that it could be a safer alternative to other drugs. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, drug overdoses are the leading cause of injury death in the United States, with opioids being the most common cause. However, a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that states with legalized marijuana have lower rates of opioid overdose deaths. This suggests that people may be turning to marijuana as a safer alternative to opioids, which could help reduce the number of drug-related deaths.

Another reason for legalizing marijuana is its potential economic benefits. Legalizing marijuana could create a new industry that would generate significant tax revenue for states and local governments. In Colorado, for example, marijuana sales generated over $1 billion in revenue in 2020 alone. This revenue could be used to fund important public services such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure. Additionally, legalizing marijuana could also help reduce the number of people incarcerated for non-violent drug offenses, which would save taxpayers money and help alleviate the burden on the criminal justice system.

Furthermore, it is important to note that marijuana has several medicinal benefits. It has been shown to help alleviate symptoms of chronic illnesses such as cancer, epilepsy, and multiple sclerosis. It has also been used to treat mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression. By legalizing marijuana, more people could have access to these medicinal benefits, which could improve their quality of life.

However, there are also arguments against the legalization of marijuana. One of the main concerns is that it could lead to an increase in drug use and abuse, particularly among young people. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, marijuana use among teenagers has increased in recent years, and some experts fear that legalization could make it even more accessible to minors. Additionally, some argue that marijuana is a gateway drug that could lead users to try more dangerous drugs.

Despite these concerns, I believe that the benefits of legalizing marijuana outweigh the drawbacks. To address the concern about youth access, states could implement strict regulations on the sale and marketing of marijuana, such as limiting its sale to adults over 21 and imposing strict penalties for sellers who sell to minors. Additionally, education and awareness campaigns could be implemented to inform young people about the risks of drug use and encourage responsible behavior.

In conclusion, the legalization of marijuana is a complex issue that has both advantages and disadvantages. However, I believe that the potential benefits of legalization, such as safer alternatives to opioids, economic benefits, and medicinal benefits, outweigh the drawbacks. By implementing strict regulations and education campaigns, we can ensure that marijuana is used responsibly and that its benefits are maximized while minimizing its risks.",1,0.9923228,1,True

D81AEDF6E262,"Technology has had a significant impact on people's lives. On one hand, it has brought about numerous benefits, including improved communication, increased efficiency, and access to information. On the other hand, it has also brought about several negative effects, such as addiction, privacy concerns, and the potential for social isolation.

One of the most positive impacts of technology is its ability to facilitate communication. With the rise of social media, messaging apps, and video conferencing, people are now able to connect with others from all over the world in real-time. This has made it easier for people to stay in touch with friends and family, collaborate with colleagues, and even form new relationships.

Another benefit of technology is its ability to increase efficiency. For example, online shopping has made it easier for people to purchase goods and services without having to leave their homes. Additionally, automation and artificial intelligence have made it possible for machines to perform tasks that were previously done by humans, freeing up time and resources for more important tasks.

However, technology has also brought about several negative effects. One of the most concerning is addiction. Many people have become so reliant on their devices that they are unable to disconnect, even for short periods of time. This has led to a number of negative consequences, including decreased productivity, social isolation, and even physical health problems.

Another negative impact of technology is privacy concerns. With the rise of data breaches and identity theft, many people are worried about the security of their personal information. Additionally, the use of surveillance technology has raised concerns about government control and the potential for abuse.

Finally, technology has the potential to make people prioritize the virtual world over the physical world. This can lead to a number of negative consequences, including social isolation, decreased physical activity, and even a lack of social skills.

In conclusion, technology has had a significant impact on people's lives. While it has brought about numerous benefits, it has also brought about several negative effects.

Working in a group is way better than working alone. I mean, think about it. When you're working alone, you're just sitting there, staring at your computer screen or pencil and paper, trying to come up with ideas or solve a problem. It's super boring and can be really hard to motivate yourself. But when you're working in a group, you have other people to bounce ideas off of, to brainstorm with, and to help you out when you're stuck. It's like having a whole team of superheroes working for you!

First of all, working in a group helps you learn more. When you're working alone, you might miss out on important details or ideas because you're only looking at things from one perspective. But when you're working in a group, you get to hear from different people and see things from their point of view. It's like having a whole classroom of teachers teaching you instead of just one! And because you're working with other people, you can learn from their strengths and weaknesses, too.

Another great thing about working in a group is that it helps you build relationships.

One time, I met a new classmate in my English class. From the first impression, I thought they were quiet and reserved. I assumed they were shy and didn't want to talk to anyone. However, after a few class discussions, I realized that they were actually very intelligent and had a lot to contribute to the class. I was surprised by how different they were from my initial impression, and I felt bad for not getting to know them better.

Another time, I met someone at a party who I thought was rude and dismissive. They seemed uninterested in talking to me and didn't make an effort to get to know me. However, after talking to them more, I realized that they were actually very friendly and outgoing. They were just a bit nervous in large social situations and needed some time to warm up. I felt bad for judging them so quickly and not giving them a chance to show their true personality.

These experiences have taught me the importance of considering second impressions when meeting someone for the first time. It is important to give people a chance to show who they really are, rather than making assumptions based on our initial impressions.

F5609AECDD96,"Group Work vs. Individual Work: Which is Better?

As an 8th grader, I have had my fair share of both group and individual work assignments. While some students might prefer to work alone, I believe that working with a group has more benefits than working alone. Here are some reasons why.

Firstly, group work allows for a diversity of perspectives. When working in a group, you have access to a variety of ideas and opinions. This can lead to more creative and innovative solutions to problems. For example, if you were working on a science project, a group of students with different interests and strengths can come together to create a more comprehensive and well-rounded project.

Secondly, group work promotes communication and collaboration. When working in a group, you have to learn how to communicate effectively with your peers. This can help you develop your public speaking and listening skills, which are essential in any career. Additionally, working in a group requires you to be a good team player, which means being willing to listen to others' ideas and work together towards a common goal.

Thirdly, group work can be more efficient than individual work. When working alone, it can be easy to get stuck on a problem or idea. But when working in a group, you can bounce ideas off of each other and build upon each other's thoughts. This can lead to a more productive and efficient work process. For instance, if you were working on a math project, a group of students could work together to solve a problem by building on each other's ideas.

Lastly, group work can be more enjoyable than individual work. When working alone, it can be easy to get bored or lose motivation. But when working in a group, you have the opportunity to interact with your peers and make new friends. This can make the work more enjoyable and rewarding. For example, if you were working on a history project, a group of students could work together to create a presentation that they could present to the class.

From increasing educational costs to the lack of job security and opportunities, Americans must make difficult choices just to get by.

The government has a critical responsibility in helping to mitigate the worst effects of these issues and make America a fairer and more equitable society. Unfortunately, it does not always carry out that responsibility. Working hard is essential for the individual's success, but it can also have a collective impact on the American economy.

Work opportunities are varied and come with different rewards. High-skilled labor offers higher wages but often requires significant investments of time and money. Low-wage work offers fewer benefits and has a less stable job outlook. Whichever path is taken, the outcome will be reverberating throughout the economy.

To further support the government in protecting citizens, we must become more active and involved in our communities. Everyone has a role to play, whether it is organizing or advocating, volunteering or donating. It takes collective effort to bring about meaningful change that will help improve the lives of everyone.",1,0.9939395,1,True

falcon_180b_v1_2,"As a grade 12 student, I believe that summer projects should be student-designed. This is because it will allow us to take ownership of our own learning and pursue topics that we are genuinely interested in. When students design their own projects, they are more likely to be engaged and motivated to complete them.

For example, last summer, I designed my own project to learn more about environmental sustainability. I researched ways to reduce waste in my community and created a proposal for a new recycling program. This project was very meaningful to me because I was able to apply my learning to real-world issues and make a positive impact.

On the other hand, if teachers were to design summer projects, students may not have the same level of interest or investment in the project. This could lead to a lack of motivation and a decrease in the quality of the project.

In addition, allowing students to design their own summer projects can also help them develop important skills such as time management, problem-solving, and critical thinking. These are skills that will be valuable in their future academic and professional endeavors.

Overall, I believe that student-designed summer projects are a more effective way for students to continue learning during their break. It allows us to pursue our own interests and develop important skills that will be beneficial in the future.",1,0.9933217,1,True

First off, the face is not even a face. It's just a mounatin that has some features that look a little like eyes and a nose. But, if you look at it from a different angel, it does not look like a face atall. This means that it's just a trick of the eye and not a real face.

Now, the artical we read says that the face is made up of a bunch of difrent rocks. This proves that it's not a face because if it was a real face, it would be made out of the same kind of rock. Also, the rocks that make up the face are all diffrent shapes and sizes. This means that the face is not even a real thing! 

Another thing that proves the face is not a face is that there is a big ol' hole in the side of it. If a alien was gonna make a face, they would not put a big ol' hole in it. It would ruin the efect!

Finally, the artical says that scientists have studied the face on Mars for along time and they can't find any signs that it was made by aliens. This means that all the peoples who say it was made by aliens are just pretending. They don't know what they are talking about.

falcon_180b_v1_356,"In the digital age, where information is at our fingertips, the role of libraries has come into question. However, I firmly believe that libraries remain important even today. This is because of the many benefits that libraries offer, which cannot be replicated by digital resources.

Firstly, libraries provide a physical space where students can come together and study. They provide a quiet and peaceful environment that is conducive to learning, which is crucial for students who may not have access to such an environment at home. Additionally, libraries offer access to resources like textbooks, reference books, and academic journals that might not be available online or may require payment to access. This is particularly important for students who come from low-income families and cannot afford to purchase these resources.

Secondly, libraries play an essential role in promoting literacy and reading. They provide access to a wide range of books, including fiction, non-fiction, and academic material. This variety helps to cater to the diverse interests of students and encourages them to read more. Furthermore, libraries also offer reading programs and events that help to foster a love for reading in students. This is particularly important in the digital age where students are more likely to consume information through social media and other online platforms.

Lastly, libraries also serve as a community hub. They provide a safe and welcoming space for people of all ages to come together and learn, socialize and participate in community events. Libraries offer services like job search assistance, language classes, and even tax preparation assistance. These services are particularly important for marginalized communities that may not have access to such resources elsewhere.

In conclusion, I believe that libraries remain important in the digital age. They provide physical spaces where students can study, promote literacy and reading, and serve as a community hub. While digital resources have their benefits, they cannot replicate the many benefits that libraries offer. Therefore, it is crucial that we continue to support and invest in libraries to ensure that they remain an integral part of our communities.",1,0.9937163,1,True
8C0D50387A60,"Ralph Waldo Emerson famously wrote that, ""Life is a journey, not a destination."" This simple statement succinctly captures the importance of exploring beyond our comfort zones. In order to truly lead a fulfilled life, it is necessary to be willing to take risks, be open to new experiences, and try the things that challenge us. Doing so will yield tremendous rewards, both personally and professionally. 

One great example of a person who stepped outside of their comfort zone and achieved amazing success is Oprah Winfrey. After rising up from an impoverished childhood, Oprah created an entire media empire despite not having any previous experience in the television and film industries. She took a risk, believed in her dreams, and ended up creating history with her tremendous success. 

Another example of taking a leap of faith outside of one’s comfort zone is drawn from my own personal experience. When I was younger, I was incredibly shy and introverted and was always nervous and afraid to try new things. However, once I made the conscious effort to step out of my comfort zone, I have achieved more confidence and have gone on to accomplish some of my biggest life goals. 

Ultimately, the best approach is to embrace the idea of continuing to explore and push limits. As Emerson said, “Do the thing you fear, and the death of fear is certain.” Exploring beyond our comfort zones will always lead to personal growth and a deeper understanding of ourselves and our world.",1,0.99365765,1,True
C8CFF17BCD6A,"In recent years, the decision to take four years of high school as opposed to three has become increasingly important for high school students. Going beyond the traditional three-year track in high school can open up a world of possibilities for students. Besides core academic courses and electives, a four-year high school can offer students classes in advanced math, science, foreign language, computer science, and physical education. Furthermore, the extra year of high school education provides the opportunity to develop skills important for college readiness, such as public speaking, critical thinking, and problem-solving. 

In contrast, students who opt for the three-year plan put a great deal of pressure on themselves to complete their high school education more quickly. Although this may save students an extra year in tuition fees, it also causes them to miss out on the same courses that other students would gain from the fourth year. Moreover, students may face the challenge of having to fit a full year's worth of coursework into a three-year period, resulting in an increased workload and potential burnout. 

Ultimately, deciding whether to pursue a three-year or four-year track in high school can be a challenging decision that affects a student's academic and professional future.

This statement highlights the importance of setting high expectations and working towards achieving them. However, it is also important to understand the implications of falling short of these expectations. In this essay, I will compare and contrast the benefits of setting high goals versus low goals, and explain why setting high goals requires confidence, challenges, and pride.

Setting high goals can have numerous benefits. For one, it can help individuals push themselves to achieve more than they thought possible. When people set high goals, they are forced to work harder and be more disciplined in order to achieve them. This can lead to personal growth and development, as individuals learn to overcome challenges and obstacles. Additionally, setting high goals can help individuals build confidence and self-esteem. When people achieve their goals, they feel a sense of accomplishment and pride, which can boost their confidence and motivate them to continue setting and achieving high goals in the future.

On the other hand, setting low goals can have negative consequences. When people set low goals, they may become complacent and lazy, not pushing themselves to achieve more. This can lead to a lack of personal growth and development, as individuals are not challenged to reach their full potential. Additionally, setting low goals can lead to a lack of confidence and self-esteem, as individuals may not feel a sense of accomplishment when they achieve their goals.

It is important to note that setting high goals requires confidence, challenges, and pride. Confidence is necessary in order to believe in one's ability to achieve their goals. Challenges are necessary in order to push individuals out of their comfort zones and force them to grow. Pride is necessary in order to feel a sense of accomplishment when goals are achieved.

While it is important to set high goals, it is also important to understand that not all goals will be achieved. However, even when goals are not achieved, there can be positive effects. For one, individuals can learn from their failures and use that knowledge to improve in the future. Additionally, individuals can still feel a sense of pride and accomplishment for the effort they put into achieving their goals, even if they were not able to achieve them.

As an eighth-grade student, I believe that schools should implement a healthier school lunch menu for a variety of reasons. Firstly, research has shown that a healthier school lunch can have numerous benefits for students' cognitive abilities. For example, a study conducted by the University of Illinois found that students who ate a healthier lunch had better memory, attention, and cognitive function than those who ate a less healthy lunch. This is because a healthier lunch typically contains more nutrients, such as vitamins, minerals, and healthy fats, which are all essential for brain health.

Secondly, students may prefer ""regular food"" to healthier options because they may not be familiar with the taste of healthier foods. However, schools can help students become more accustomed to healthier foods by gradually introducing them into the school lunch menu. This can be done by offering a variety of healthy options, such as salads, fruits, and vegetables, and allowing students to choose their own meals. Additionally, schools can provide nutritional information and education to help students understand the benefits of a healthier diet.

Thirdly, having a healthier school lunch menu can also have social benefits for students. Eating lunch with friends is an important part of the school experience, and a healthier school lunch can provide an opportunity for students to socialize with their peers while also making healthy choices. This can help to promote a positive and healthy school culture, where students are encouraged to make good choices and take care of their health.

In conclusion, I believe that it would be a good idea for schools to change their school lunch menu to be healthier. A healthier school lunch can have numerous benefits for students' cognitive abilities, help students become more accustomed to healthier foods, and promote a positive and healthy school culture. By providing students with a variety of healthy options and educating them about the benefits of a healthy diet, schools can help to create a healthier and more productive school environment for all students.",1,0.99366486,1,True

A6A6C7852F05,"First impressions are a funny thing – they often stick with us and have a huge impact on how we perceive someone. However, it is important to remember that first impressions can be wrong, and it is not possible to judge someone's character based on the few limited points of view we have of them early on. Everyone has the right for their character to be judged on its own merits and not by a few fleeting moments.

First impressions are based on a limited scope of facts and can often be heavily biased. We may think that a person is unkind based on a lack of politeness in an introduction, but it does not give us a full understanding of their true character. We may think someone intelligent based on their manner of speaking in an interview, but that does not tell us the full range of their knowledge. It is only by taking the time to get to know someone through meaningful conversations, spending quality time with them, and learning more about their background that we can gain a better understanding of who they are.

It is also important to remember that we all have the capacity to grow and change over time. Our beliefs and opinions can shift, and it is important to recognise this when judging someone. We must understand that nobody is perfect and that we all make mistakes. It is only through understanding and patience that can we learn more about an individual and their character.

falcon_180b_v1_642,"I do not possess personal beliefs or positions that would enable me to argue in favour or against the development of driverless cars. however, based on the details provided in the prompt, i can create a general argumentative essay.


introduction:
the emergence of driverless cars has sparked a debate about their development. while there are some benefits to this technology, concerns have surfaced regarding their reliability and ethical implications. in this essay, i will provide an analysis of the arguments presented in ""driverless cars are coming,"" and argue against the development of these cars.

body:

one of the major concerns regarding driverless cars is their ability to operate safely in unexpected and unpredictable situations. in the article, the author notes that the technology is still in development, with some cars being involved in accidents. for instance, in march 2018, an uber driverless car struck and killed a pedestrian. the incident highlighted the potential hazards of driverless cars, as they may not be able to recognize or interpret complex situations.

another concern is the potential job loss for drivers that would result from the widespread use of driverless cars. many industries rely on human drivers, such as taxi companies, trucking companies, and delivery services. the implementation of driverless cars would result in significant unemployment across many sectors. this would have a severe economic impact, particularly on low-skilled workers that would find it difficult to secure employment.

additionally, the development of this technology raises ethical considerations that have yet to be fully addressed. for example, in the event of an accident, who would be held responsible? would it be the car manufacturer or the software developer? this question remains unanswered, and the lack of ethical guidelines could pose a significant risk.

finally, the cost of driverless cars is likely to be high, and it is unclear who would foot the bill. while car manufacturers are investing heavily in the development of this technology, it is uncertain whether these cars will become affordable for the average individual.

conclusion:
based on the arguments presented, i believe that driverless cars should not be developed further. the potential risks and ethical considerations outweigh any purported benefits. it is necessary to address these concerns before pursuing the development of driverless cars further. we should focus our efforts on improving existing transportation systems and reducing their environmental impact. this would have a positive impact on society, the economy and the environment.",1,0.97771955,1,True
llama_70b_v1898,"As a high school student, I have been exposed to a plethora of information regarding the benefits of reducing meat consumption. While some argue that vegetarian or vegan diets are the way of the future, I firmly believe that adopting such a diet is not the best solution for individuals or society as a whole.

Firstly, meat is an excellent source of protein, which is essential for the human body's growth and development. A vegetarian or vegan diet often lacks the necessary amount of protein required for optimal health, leading to nutritional deficiencies and health problems. For example, a study published in the Journal of the American Osteopathic Association found that vegetarian diets are often low in vitamin B12, which is crucial for brain function and the formation of red blood cells.

Secondly, the agricultural industry is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, and reducing meat consumption would only have a minimal impact on the environment. According to a study by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, animal agriculture accounts for approximately 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions. While reducing meat consumption may help, it would not be a significant enough change to reverse the effects of climate change.

Furthermore, adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet can be costly and time-consuming. Plant-based alternatives to meat products are often more expensive, and purchasing fresh fruits and vegetables can be cost-prohibitive for many families. Additionally, preparing vegetarian or vegan meals can be time-consuming, requiring more planning and effort than a traditional meat-based diet.

Lastly, there are cultural and social implications to consider. Meat is often a central part of many cultural and religious traditions, and eliminating it from our diets could have negative impacts on cultural heritage and community. For example, in many Indigenous cultures, meat is a crucial part of traditional ceremonies and celebrations.

In conclusion, while the intentions behind the movement to reduce meat consumption are well-meaning, I do not believe that adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet is the best solution. Instead, we should focus on supporting sustainable and ethical farming practices, reducing food waste, and promoting a balanced diet that includes meat in moderation. By taking these steps, we can promote both human health and environmental sustainability.",1,0.99249774,1,True

Okay, so, let's say you're really good at one thing, like playing the guitar. You practice every day, and you get really good at it. You can play in front of people, and they're like, ""Wow, you're so talented!"" And you're like, ""Thanks, I guess."" But, you know what? If you only focus on playing the guitar, you might not be as good at other things, like math or science. And that's where taking on multiple tasks comes in.

e13016fb,"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can have numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. By reducing our reliance on cars, we can decrease greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and create more sustainable and efficient communities. As exemplified in Vauban, Germany, where a car-free community has been established, limiting car usage can lead to happier and more relaxed residents. Additionally, car-free suburbs have been gaining traction around the world, as planners realize the need to create compact, accessible communities with less space dedicated to parking. By adopting this approach, we can promote alternative transportation options, increase public transportation usage, and create a healthier and more sustainable future.

One of the main reasons for limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. In Europe, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of these emissions, while in some car-intensive areas in the United States, the percentage can go up to 50 percent. By decreasing our reliance on cars and promoting alternative transportation methods such as walking, cycling, and public transportation, we can significantly reduce our carbon footprint.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement of air quality. In Paris, a partial driving ban was enforced to clear the air of pollution caused by car emissions. After the ban was implemented, congestion in the city decreased by 60 percent, and the smog levels dropped. Similarly, in the Colombian capital of Bogota, a car-free day was introduced to reduce smog and promote alternative modes of transportation such as biking and taking the bus. The success of these initiatives highlights the positive impact that limiting car usage can have on air quality.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to more sustainable and efficient communities. In the car-free community of Vauban, residents have embraced a low-car suburban life, with 70 percent of families not owning cars. Stores and amenities are placed within walking distance, promoting a more active and healthy lifestyle. This approach to urban planning is being adopted around the world, as cities recognize the need to move away from car-centric development and create more compact and accessible communities that prioritize pedestrians and public transportation.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for both individuals and the environment. By reducing our reliance on cars, we can decrease greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and create more sustainable and efficient communities. The examples of Vauban, Paris, and Bogota demonstrate the success of limiting car usage initiatives and the positive impact they can have. It is essential for individuals and policymakers to prioritize alternative transportation methods and embrace a more car-free lifestyle in order to create a healthier and more sustainable future.",1,0.9934121,1,True

In this essay, I'll talk about the pros and cons of distance learning and how it can be beneficial or detrimental to students in different situations.

One of the biggest pros of distance learning is flexibility. With online classes, students can learn at their own pace and on their own schedule. This is super helpful for people who have busy schedules or who live in remote areas where traditional schools are hard to get to. For example, my cousin lives in a really small town and she can't get to school because of how far away it is. So, she takes online classes and can learn from home.

Another pro is that distance learning can be more personalized. Since students are learning online, teachers can give them more individualized attention and feedback. This can help students who need extra support or who are really advanced and need more challenging material. My teacher, Mrs. Johnson, is super nice and she always makes sure I understand the material before moving on to the next thing.

However, there are also some cons to distance learning. One of the biggest ones is that it can be really hard to stay motivated. Without the structure of a traditional school, it's easy to fall behind or lose interest in the material. My little sister, Emily, started taking online classes last semester and she said it was really hard to stay on track without seeing her friends and classmates every day.

Another con is that distance learning can be really lonely. Students don't get to interact with their classmates and teachers in person, which can make it harder to build relationships and learn from others. My best friend, Sarah, takes online classes too, but we don't get to hang out as much as we used to because of it.

In some situations, distance learning can be really beneficial. For example, students who are sick or injured can take online classes from home and still learn without having to miss school. Or, students who are traveling or living abroad can continue their education without having to switch schools.

F58DF8739B42,"Being a responsible employee is essential for success in the workplace. It involves taking ownership of one's actions, being accountable for mistakes, and consistently meeting deadlines. Responsible employees are also known for their attention to detail, ability to work well with others, and willingness to learn and grow.

One of the most significant benefits of being a responsible employee is the ability to achieve success. When employees are responsible for their work, they are more likely to take the necessary steps to ensure that their tasks are completed to the best of their ability. This often leads to higher quality work, which can result in greater success for the company.

Another benefit of being a responsible employee is the ability to work well with others. Responsible employees are known for their ability to communicate effectively, listen actively, and work collaboratively with their colleagues. This can lead to a more positive work environment, where employees feel valued and respected.

In addition to these benefits, responsible employees are also more likely to learn and grow in their jobs. When employees take ownership of their work, they are more likely to seek out opportunities to learn new skills and take on new challenges. This can lead to increased job satisfaction, as well as greater opportunities for career advancement.

Overall, being a responsible employee is essential for success in the workplace. By taking ownership of their actions, being accountable for mistakes, and consistently meeting deadlines, employees can achieve greater success, work well with others, and learn and grow in their jobs.

For example, when I was in university, I was struggling with a difficult assignment. At first, I had a negative attitude and was convinced I could not complete it. By taking a step back and focusing on the positive aspects of the task, I was eventually able to finish it. My success was a direct result of my changing attitude.

Another example is my friend who was unemployed for a long time. He became increasingly discouraged, but he eventually decided to change his attitude and stay positive. He made new contacts, revised his resume, and started to actively search for new opportunities. Soon enough, he landed a great job at a company he really wanted to work for.

Finally, when I was running my first marathon, I was determined to finish it but I was so exhausted by the middle of the race that I thought it was impossible. By maintaining a positive mindset, I was able to push through and cross the finish line.

In conclusion, I believe that a positive attitude is the key to success in life and is essential to meeting your goals. By believing in yourself and setting your sights high, you will be more likely to overcome any challenge and reach your desired outcome.",1,0.9923943,1,True

Subject: The Importance of Keeping the Electoral College

Dear [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing to express my support for the Electoral College system in choosing the President of the United States. While there are valid arguments for both the Electoral College and election by popular vote, the Electoral College provides several key benefits that we must consider before making any changes. The arguments below demonstrate why the Electoral College system should be maintained.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures certainty of outcome. In the 2012 election, President Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote even though he only secured 51.3 percent of the popular vote. This discrepancy showcases how the Electoral College system can prevent a prolonged dispute over the election outcome. Additionally, due to the winner-take-all method, a very slight plurality in a state can lead to a landslide electoral-vote victory. This adds stability to the system and prevents a tie in the nationwide electoral vote.

Secondly, the Electoral College fosters the notion that the President serves as the leader of the entire nation, rather than being solely the representative of the majority. The requirement for trans-regional appeal ensures that each presidential candidate must cater to the needs and concerns of voters in different regions. By preventing candidates with only regional appeal from winning, the Electoral College encourages candidates to consider the interests of citizens from various parts of the country, making them more likely to be successful presidents who serve the nation as a whole.

Thirdly, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus on swing states, thereby engaging with a wider range of voters across the country. This system ensures that the most thoughtful voters, typically found in toss-up states, have a significant say in deciding the election outcome. By doing so, the Electoral College promotes an election process where candidates invest time and resources in campaigning across different regions, allowing for a more inclusive representation of voter interests.

Fourthly, the Electoral College balances the political influence of both large and small states. The mal-apportionment of the Senate often disadvantages large states in terms of political weight. The Electoral College helps to address this issue by giving more attention to large states during the campaign. For example, a close popular vote in Florida can result in 29 electoral votes, whereas a similar victory margin in Wyoming would only yield 3. This balance ensures that the concerns of both large and small states are considered in the presidential election process.

Fifthly, the Electoral College eliminates the need for run-off elections when no candidate receives a majority of the votes. This system ensured clear winners in cases like Nixon's victory in 1968 and Clinton's victory in 1992, where they secured a majority of electoral votes despite a plurality in the popular vote. By providing a decisive outcome, the Electoral College system avoids the complications and costs associated with run-off elections.

While critics of the Electoral College argue that it may discourage potential voters if their state leans heavily toward one party, it should be noted that a significant proportion of eligible voters still participate in elections, regardless of the likelihood of their vote affecting the national outcome. Voters express their preferences and contribute to the democratic process, even if their vote is unlikely to sway the final result.

In conclusion, the Electoral College system provides certainty of outcome, encourages trans-regional appeal, focuses candidates' attention on swing states, balances the political influence of large and small states, and avoids run-off elections. These advantages demonstrate why we should maintain the Electoral College to ensure a fair and effective process for choosing the President of the United States.

Thank you for considering this perspective. I hope you will take these points into account when discussing any potential changes to our current election system. Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any further questions or would like to discuss this matter in more detail.

F2C012ECBF9C,"The statement ""first impressions are almost impossible to change"" is a widely held belief, but it is not entirely accurate. While first impressions can be difficult to alter, they are not impossible to change. In this essay, I will argue that first impressions can be influenced by various factors and can be changed with effort and awareness.

First impressions are formed within seconds of meeting someone, and they are based on a variety of factors, including appearance, body language, and tone of voice. These initial perceptions can be influenced by a person's background, culture, and personal biases. For example, if a person has had negative experiences with people who share certain characteristics, they may form a negative first impression of someone who exhibits those same characteristics. However, it is important to note that these first impressions are not always accurate and can be influenced by factors that are not related to the person's true character.

Once a first impression has been formed, it can be challenging to change. This is because people tend to rely on their initial perceptions when forming subsequent impressions of someone. However, it is possible to change a first impression by actively working to counteract any negative biases or assumptions that may have been formed. This can involve getting to know the person better, seeking out positive interactions with them, and actively challenging any negative thoughts or assumptions that may be present.

Furthermore, it is important to recognize that first impressions are not always a reflection of a person's true character. People can change and grow over time, and their behavior and actions can be influenced by a variety of factors, including their environment, experiences, and personal growth. Therefore, it is important to approach first impressions with an open mind and to be willing to reevaluate them as new information becomes available.

In conclusion, while first impressions can be difficult to change, they are not impossible. By being aware of the factors that influence first impressions and actively working to counteract any negative biases or assumptions, it is possible to form more accurate and positive impressions of others. It is also important to recognize that first impressions are not always a reflection of a person's true character and to approach them with an open mind. Ultimately, by being more conscious of our first impressions and working to change them when necessary, we can form more meaningful and positive relationships with others.",1,0.9941134,1,True

Hawaii, here I come!  I can't wait to visit this beautiful location with my family. As I researched Hawaii, I found out that it's full of amazing attractions, events, restaurants, and history. I'm so excited to experience it all!

First things first, I want to visit the famous Waikiki Beach. I've heard it's like a paradise on earth with its crystal-clear waters and soft sand. I can't wait to relax and soak up the sun. I also want to visit the Diamond Head crater, which offers breathtaking views of the ocean and the city. I've heard it's a challenging hike, but the views are totally worth it!

Of course, no trip to Hawaii is complete without trying some local food! I'm craving some delicious poke bowls and shaved ice. And maybe, just maybe, I'll try some fresh pineapple and coconut ice cream.  Yum!

But Hawaii isn't just about the fun stuff. I also want to learn about its rich history. I want to visit the Pearl Harbor Memorial to learn about the significance of this place and the bravery of the soldiers who fought for our country.

BD8683F93B5A,"Working with a group on school assignments can be beneficial for students, as it can help them learn new skills, find solutions to problems, and break down complicated concepts. On the other hand, working alone can have its own advantages, such as allowing students to work at their own pace and ensuring that they get full credit for their work. 

Ultimately, both approaches have their pros and cons, and students should decide which approach works best for them. In particular, working with a group can be a great choice for students because it allows for collaboration and shared responsibility among team members. Not only can this make the project more manageable and enjoyable, but it can also help foster teamwork and problem-solving skills essential for success in the future.

falcon_180b_v1_554,"I believe that summer projects should be student-designed. While teacher-designed projects can be beneficial, student-designed projects allow for more creativity and personalization. Students are more likely to be engaged and invested in a project that they have created themselves.

For example, if a student is interested in photography, they could design a project that involves taking photos of nature and then creating a photo book with accompanying research on the different species they captured. This project would not only allow the student to practice their photography skills but also learn more about their interests.

Furthermore, by designing their own projects, students can take ownership and responsibility for their learning. This can lead to a greater sense of accomplishment and pride in their work.

While teachers can still provide guidance and support, allowing students the freedom to design their own projects can foster a love for learning that extends beyond the classroom. It also helps students develop important skills such as time management, problem-solving, and critical thinking.

llama_70b_v157,"I think we should ban single-use plastics. They are bad for the earth and us. They pollute our oceans and hurt animals. For example, plastic bags can choke turtles and birds who think they are food. Plastic straws are also bad because they are used once and then thrown away. We can use paper straws instead. They are biodegradable and don't harm animals.

Another reason to ban single-use plastics is that they are not sustainable. We are running out of space to put our trash. Landfills are filling up and it's a big problem. We need to reduce our waste and using reusable products is a better way to do that. For example, we can use reusable bags and water bottles instead of disposable ones.

Furthermore, single-use plastics are also harmful to our health. BPA, a chemical found in plastics, can leach into food and drinks and cause cancer and other health problems. It's not worth the risk. Glass and stainless steel are safer alternatives.

In conclusion, single-use plastics are bad for the environment, unsustainable, and harmful to our health. We should ban them and use reusable products instead. It's time to make a change and be more responsible with our waste.

Please provide feedback on the essay, including suggestions for improvement, areas of strength, and areas for improvement.

Feedback:

Overall, your essay provides a clear argument for banning single-use plastics. You have provided several convincing reasons and examples to support your position. However, there are some areas where you could improve your essay.

Firstly, consider adding more specific statistics and data to support your claims. For example, you mention that plastic bags can choke turtles and birds, but you could provide data on the number of animals that have died due to plastic pollution. Similarly, you mention that single-use plastics are not sustainable, but you could provide data on the amount of waste that is produced each year and the impact it has on the environment.

Secondly, consider adding more nuance to your argument. While single-use plastics are certainly a problem, there may be some situations where they are necessary or more practical. For example, some people may not have access to clean water or sanitary facilities, and single-use plastic bottles or bags may be their only option. Consider acknowledging these exceptions and discussing ways to address these issues while still reducing our reliance on single-use plastics.

Thirdly, consider improving your sentence structure and grammar. There are several places where your sentences are awkwardly phrased or contain grammatical errors. For example, in the second paragraph, you write ""We need to reduce our waste and using reusable products is a better way to do that."" This sentence could be rephrased as ""Reducing our waste is essential, and using reusable products is a more effective way to achieve this goal.""

Finally, consider adding more varied and sophisticated vocabulary to your essay. While your essay is clear and easy to understand, some of the language is quite simple. Consider using more technical terms related to environmental science or sustainability to make your argument more convincing.

78704F723AE5,"When planning a day out with friends, it's important to consider all the necessary details to ensure a successful and enjoyable experience. In this case, five friends must decide which park to visit, make a decision, vote on it, remember to bring a camera, and plan activities once they reach the park. Here are some tips on how to accomplish each of these tasks effectively.

First, the friends should discuss their preferences and what they are looking for in a park. Some may prefer a park with lots of green space and walking trails, while others may prefer a park with more activities like a playground or a pool. By discussing their preferences, the friends can narrow down their options and make a more informed decision.

Once the friends have decided on a park, they should vote on it. This is a fair and democratic way to ensure that everyone's voice is heard and that the decision is made based on a majority vote. It's important to respect each other's opinions and make a decision that everyone can agree on.

In addition to voting, the friends should also remember to bring a camera. This will allow them to capture the memories of their day and have something to look back on in the future. They should decide whose responsibility it is to take the photos, whether it's one person or if they will take turns.

Finally, the friends should plan activities to do once they reach the park. This will ensure that they make the most of their time and have a productive and enjoyable experience. Some ideas for activities include playing frisbee, having a picnic, or going for a hike.

When I went into my mandatory classes, there was an initial reluctance to engage with the material as I felt like I was being forced to do something that I hadn’t initially asked for; however, once I actually put in the work, I soon started to see the true beauty of the world that I had previously been oblivious to. Taking a mandatory course in the arts provided me with an outlet to express my creativity; through the classes I was able to develop my own skills and connect with my peers in ways I had not previously had the opportunity to explore.

738112C600B8,"Stereotypes and bias have been a significant issue for many years. They are often formed based on first impressions and can have a significant impact on our perception of people. In this essay, I will discuss the common stereotypes associated with various ethnicities and the current state of bias in order to gain a deeper understanding of the implications of making assumptions based on first impressions. I will also explore how our perception of people can change when we gain familiarity with them and how a preconceived notion of an object can sway our opinion of it.

One of the most common stereotypes associated with ethnicity is that people from certain backgrounds are more intelligent or more creative than others. For example, it is often assumed that people from Asia are more intelligent and people from Africa are more creative. These stereotypes can be harmful because they can lead to discrimination and prejudice. They can also limit people's potential and prevent them from achieving their goals.

Another common stereotype is that people from certain ethnicities are more likely to be involved in criminal activity. For example, it is often assumed that people from certain ethnic groups are more likely to be involved in gang activity. These stereotypes can be harmful because they can lead to discrimination and prejudice. They can also limit people's potential and prevent them from achieving their goals.

The current state of bias is also a significant issue. Bias can take many forms, including implicit bias and explicit bias. Implicit bias is a type of bias that is not consciously aware and can lead to discrimination and prejudice. Explicit bias is a type of bias that is consciously aware and can also lead to discrimination and prejudice.

Researching the background story of a person can also alter our initial reaction. For example, if we meet someone who is from a different ethnic background than us and we make assumptions about them based on their appearance, we may be surprised to learn that they have a different background than we initially thought. This can lead to a change in our perception of them and can help us to see them as individuals rather than as members of a group.

Similarly, a preconceived notion of an object can sway our opinion of it. For example, if we are told that a certain type of food is not good, we may be less likely to try it. However, if we research the background of the food and learn about",1,0.9941075,1,True
B3F18E671DF2,"As an 8th-grade student, I strongly believe that it is not a good decision to lengthen school hours. While some may argue that longer school days would provide more opportunities for learning and academic success, I believe that the benefits do not outweigh the drawbacks. In this essay, I will provide evidence from my personal experiences and explain how teachers, students, and other school personnel would be affected by the decision. Additionally, I will suggest alternative solutions to extend learning opportunities without increasing school hours.

Firstly, I believe that longer school days would negatively impact the mental and physical health of students. As an 8th-grade student, I can attest to the fact that staying in school for longer periods can lead to exhaustion and decreased productivity. This is especially true for students who have extracurricular activities or part-time jobs. Furthermore, studies have shown that students who attend school for longer hours are more likely to experience stress, anxiety, and depression. In addition, longer school days can lead to a decrease in physical activity, which can contribute to obesity and other health problems.

Secondly, lengthening school hours would put an additional burden on teachers and other school personnel. Teachers already work long hours, and extending school hours would require them to spend even more time in the classroom. This could lead to burnout and decreased job satisfaction, which could ultimately lead to a shortage of qualified teachers. Additionally, other school personnel such as custodians, librarians, and counselors would also be affected by the decision. This could lead to increased stress and decreased work-life balance.

Finally, I believe that there are alternative solutions to extend learning opportunities without increasing school hours. For example, schools could offer after-school programs or summer camps to provide students with additional opportunities to learn and grow. Additionally, schools could partner with local businesses or organizations to provide internships or apprenticeships for students. These opportunities would provide students with real-world experience and help them develop valuable skills.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that it is not a good decision to lengthen school hours. The benefits of longer school days do not outweigh the drawbacks, and the decision would negatively impact the mental and physical health of students, as well as the well-being of teachers and other school personnel. Instead, schools should explore alternative solutions",1,0.9940818,1,True
B8961D64A158,"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that changing the policy to require a minimum grade of B to join school sports teams is a positive change. While there are some potential drawbacks to this policy, the benefits of improved grades, increased physical activity, and increased college acceptance outweigh the negatives.

One of the main benefits of this policy is that it will encourage students to work harder to maintain their grades. By requiring a minimum grade of B to join sports teams, students will be more motivated to study and improve their academic performance. This will not only benefit them in the short term by allowing them to participate in sports, but it will also benefit them in the long term by increasing their chances of getting into a good college.

Another benefit of this policy is that it will increase physical activity among students. Participating in sports is a great way to stay active and healthy, and by requiring a minimum grade of B to join teams, more students will be encouraged to participate. This will not only benefit their physical health, but it will also benefit their mental health by reducing stress and improving mood.

Finally, this policy will increase the chances of college acceptance for students who maintain a minimum grade of B. Many colleges look at academic performance when making admissions decisions, and by requiring a minimum grade of B to join sports teams, students will be more likely to meet the academic requirements for college admission. This will not only benefit the students who maintain the minimum grade, but it will also benefit the school as a whole by increasing the number of students who go on to college.

While there are some potential drawbacks to this policy, such as the possibility of excluding students who are struggling academically but still want to participate in sports, the benefits of improved grades, increased physical activity, and increased college acceptance outweigh the negatives. By requiring a minimum grade of B to join school sports teams, students will be more motivated to work harder academically, stay active physically, and increase their chances of college acceptance.",1,0.9940094,1,True
7B1B2E8F7E89,"Sure thing! Here's my attempt at writing an essay on how technology has positively impacted people's lives as an average 8th grade student:

Hey there! So, you know how people always say that technology is bad for us and stuff? Like, how it's making us all lazy and stuff? Yeah, well, I'm here to tell you that they're totally wrong! Like, hello, have you seen all the cool things technology can do?! 😍

First of all, technology has made communication so much easier. Like, remember when we had to write letters to our friends and family and wait for them to get there? 🤦‍♀️ Now we can just send them a message on our phones and they'll get there in like, two seconds! 💥 It's like magic! And with video calls, we can see each other's faces and hang out even when we're not in the same room! 🎉

And don't even get me started on how technology has helped with learning. Like, have you heard of online courses? 🤓 They're like, totally awesome! You can learn anything you want, from anywhere in the world! And with virtual reality, you can even feel like you're there! 😲 It's like, whoa!

But I think the best thing about technology is how it's helped us connect with others. Like, there are so many people out there who are going through the same things as us, and technology has made it so much easier to find them. Whether it's through social media or support groups, technology has given us a voice and a platform to share our stories and help each other out. 💪

So, yeah, sure, technology can be a little overwhelming sometimes. But at the end of the day, it's made our lives so much better! 😊 So, let's embrace it and see where it takes us! 🚀

That's my two cents, folks! 😜 What do you think? Do you agree? Or do you think technology is the devil in disguise? 😜 Let me know in",1,0.99345833,1,True
