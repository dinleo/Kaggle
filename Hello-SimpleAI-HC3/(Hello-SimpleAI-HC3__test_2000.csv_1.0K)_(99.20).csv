"How do those gel heatpack work ? you bend a piece of metal ..... boom heat , how ? i do nt get it Please explain like I'm five.","[""They use a compound called sodium acetate - also sometimes known as ' hot ice ' . It is a material that can easily be supercooled - taken well below it 's melting point without solidifying again . When you click the disc on the handwarmer , this starts the gel crystallising / solidifying . At temperatures colder than 50 - somethingÂºC it wants to be solid . As the bonds break and form to move from liquid to solid , they give off an excess of energy as heat ( an exothermic process ) . When you boil the gel pack in water , the heat takes it back past its melting point to turn it from crystal back to liquid and the heat from the boiling is what provides that energy ( endothermic process ) ."", 'They give off heat through "" phase change "" which is when something changes states , in this case liquid to solid . The energy involved in the actual change is a lot greater than the energy involved in just raising or lowering the material \'s temperature . Think of a cooler of ice water , when it is at the point of melting ice takes a huge amount of heat to fully melt into water . This is why the cooler of ice water can keep something cold for a long time , the changing phase from ice to water absorbs a lot of heat . The heat pack is the exact opposite change , it goes from liquid to solid which in turn gives off a lot of heat . This heat ( energy ) was put into the gel in the microwave to turn it into a liquid which ended up storing said heat . The seemingly magic part is how it is stored until it is needed . This is something called "" superheating "" and "" supercooling . "" What this means is that the material is beyond the freezing or melting point without freezing or melting . This can happen for a number of reasons , the biggest one being that phase change usually requires a starting point , called a "" nucleation site . "" If the substance is pure and does n\'t have a starting point it can go beyond its normal phase change point without changing . You might have heard that all snow flakes have a spec of dust at the center , this is because the super cooled water vapor only turned to ice when it nucleated on the dust particle . Another neat trick is to put a beer in the freezer , so long as it is n\'t given a nucleation site , such as a carbon dioxide bubble , it can go below its freezing point . Once you shake it and release CO2 it will instantly freeze . URL_0 When the bottle does this it actually is giving off heat because it is lowering the temperature of the beer as it freezes and when you lower the temperature of something it gives off heat by definition . The gel in the heat pack is very pure and designed to super cool without freezing ( solidifying ) . Now unlike the beer it is also designed to do this in a specific temperature range ( I believe somewhere in the ball park of 100 degrees F ) which is the range that we want a heat pack to be at . Different substances have different freezing points and energy levels involved and this one is specifically chosen / designed for this purpose . The final part to the "" trick "" is the nucleation site which is the clicker . After you microwave the gel it sits as a liquid that wants to change into a solid but ca n\'t . Once you click the metal disk it creates a nucleation site which changes the liquid to a solid ( gel ) . This gives off the heat that was introduced by the microwave as the liquid turns rapidly to a solid .', ""The gel inside is a supercooled liquid . To explain supercooled liquids , consider a rope net that is rated to hold 100 kg . If you put anything heavier than that in the net and there is some disturbance , the net will rip apart and change forms to tattered pieces of rope . But what if there is no disturbance ? You decide to test your luck and put a larger weight in the net , stretching the rope even more taut . But the net holds ! You realize the net can carry even more weight than 100 kg as long as you do n't disturb it ! This is how supercooled liquids work . For example , water can be cooled lower than 0 degrees C ( freezing point ) if there are no impurities ( called nucleation sites ) or disturbances that start the freezing process . Normally , dissolved gas bubbles or any small particles will cause water to easily freeze to ice at 0 C. For the gel in the heatpacks , they are made of food grade salt sodium acetate which freezes at 54 degrees C ! Higher than room temperature ! They are in a liquid supercooled state at room temperature . When you bend the metal , you are causing a disturbance that starts the freezing process . The gel then starts freezing into a solid and shoots up to 54 degrees C. Energy is released as heat as it freezes . To restore the liquid , you have to boil the pack so that it turns into a liquid and then as it cools back to room temperature , it returns to a supercool liquid state .""]",0,real,0.007499741,0,True
"How do we not remember EVERYTHING in our lives ( being born , very early childhood , etc . ) ?

How is it not caught every time ..', 'Cocaine is made from coca leaves . Opiates ( such as heroin ) are made from opium resin , from the sap of poppy flowers . Coca is a bushy plant that is native to South America , and grown mostly there . ( Coca is not to be confused with cacao , which is the plant that chocolate comes from . ) Poppies are a flower that is native to the Mediterranean region , but is today most heavily grown in central and southern Asia . Poppy flowers that you can buy at garden shops are actually the same species as "" opium poppies "" , and they do contain opiates . It \'s legal to grow them for decorative purposes , but not to extract opium from them . ( The bright orange "" California poppy "" does not contain opium . ) Similarly , poppy seeds that are used in pastries do contain a tiny amount of opiates . It \'s a myth that eating one poppyseed bagel will make you test positive for opiates on a drug test . However , some European pastries are stuffed with poppyseed - based filling and will certainly register on a urine test . A blood test can tell the difference between heroin ( or fentanyl ) and poppyseeds , though . ( Historically , poppy seeds were a byproduct of opium production . Opium has been used as a medicine for pain since the dawn of recorded history in Europe . There are sculptures from Minoan Crete depicting the poppy as a goddess of healing . By the way , cannabis is from the Caucasus , and the Greek historian Herodotus was kind of weirded out by how the people there â the Scythians â used it : they would burn it in bonfires to get high on the smoke . ) Anyway , these plants are grown secretly , or with the cooperation ( bribery ) of local governments . Extracting cocaine from coca leaves , or crude opium from poppies , does n\'t have to be much more complicated than extracting caffeine from coffee beans or tea leaves . But for the drug trade , it \'s done with chemicals to make it faster and more efficient . Turning opium into heroin is a bunch more complicated and involves secret chemical labs . Opium is ancient , but heroin was only invented in the 20th century . Extracting opium from poppies involves letting the flower go to seed , and then scratching or cutting the seed - pod to make it ooze sap . The sap contains a mixture of many different chemicals , some of which are already drugs ( primarily morphine ) and others that can be chemically changed to make drugs . Extracting cocaine from coca leaves involves soaking them in water and chemicals to get the cocaine to dissolve out of the leaves . It \'s worth noting that coca leaves and poppy extracts can be used as drugs without any further preparation . Native people in Colombia , Bolivia , and Peru have chewed coca leaves as a mild stimulant for thousands of years . The ancient Greeks and Persians used opium extracted from poppies with alcohol from wine . However , coca leaves and poppy pods are very bulky ; refined cocaine and heroin are much more compact and therefore easier to smuggle . There is a general rule that when drugs are made illegal , people find ways to make the drugs stronger , because stronger drugs are easier to smuggle . In the 1920s , when the U.S. prohibited alcohol , the production of beer and wine basically shut down , but gin and whiskey became more popular . Cocaine is stronger than coca leaves , and crack is stronger again than cocaine . Modern cannabis is much stronger than the "" Indian hemp "" that has been grown for thousands of years . Some of the opiates used today , such as carfentanil , are so much stronger than plain opium that they were originally invented not even as painkillers , but to be used in tranquilizer darts on elephants !']",0,real,0.0065628006,0,True

How do you report S-corporation Shareholder loans / capital contributions?,"[""As the owner of the S-corp, it is far easier for you to move money in/out of the company as contributions and distributions rather than making loans to the company. Loans require interest payments, 1099-INT forms, and have tax consequences, whereas the distributions don't need to be reported because you pay taxes on net profits regardless of whether the money was distributed. If you were paid interest, disregard this answer. I don't know if or how you could re-categorize the loan once there's a 1099-INT involved. If no interest was ever paid, you just need to account for it properly: If the company didn't pay you any interest and never issued you a 1099-INT form (i.e. you wrote a check to the company, no promissory note, no tax forms, no payments, no interest, etc.) then you can categorize that money as a capital contribution. You can likewise take that money back out of the company as a capital distribution and neither of these events are taxable nor do they need to be reported to the IRS. In Quickbooks, create the following Equity accounts -- one for each shareholder making capital contributions and distributions: When putting money into the company, deposit into your corporate bank account and use the Capital Contribution equity account.

At the end of every tax year, you can close out your Contributions and Distributions to Retained Earnings by making a general journal entry. For example, debit retained earnings and credit distributions on Dec 31 every year to zero-out the distributions account. For contributions, do the reverse and credit retained earnings. There are other ways of recording these transactions -- for example I think some people just use a Member Capital equity account instead of separate accounts for contributions and distributions -- and QB might warn you about posting journal entries to the special Retained Earnings account at the end of the year. In any case, this is how my CPA set up my books and it's been working well enough for many years. Still, never a bad idea to get a second opinion from your CPA. Be sure to pay yourself a reasonable salary, you can't get out of payroll taxes and just distribute profits -- that's a big red flag that can trigger an audit. If you're simply distributing back the money you already put into the company, that should be fine.""]",0,real,0.008312279,0,True

You will not be able to secure financing through a bank or a mortgage broker without an escrow company, and it might be hard without an agent. Agents required by law to know all the details of the process, and they can guide you through what to do and what to look into. They have experience reading and understanding the inspection reports, they know what to demand from the seller (disclosures, information, etc), they know how and from where to get the HOA docs and disclosures, and can help you negotiate the price knowing the market information (comparable sales, comparable listings, list vs sales statistics, etc). It is hard to do all that alone, but if you do - you should definitely get a discount over the market price of the property of about 5% (the agents' fees are up to 5% mostly). I bought several properties in California and in other states, and I wouldn't do it without an agent on my side.

"How do apps like shazam and soundhound work ? Once they listen to the song , how do they find out what song it is ? Do they find like a matching audio file or something like that ? Explain like I'm five.","['I do n\'t know about Soundhound , but for Shazam specifically , here is how it works ( or at least did a few years ago when I read about this ) ; As the Shazam app records the song , it will split it up into short blocks of time . Within each period of time , it will figure out what frequency is the loudest . Assuming that the music is the loudest thing happening , this does an excellent job of filtering out any background noise and quiet notes that may be imperceptible to a crappy cell phone microphone . It does n\'t matter if people are talking or a door opens or if your cell mic ca n\'t pick out that exquisite bass guitar in the background -- only the loudest thing matters . The result is a "" fingerprint "" of the song --- a list of the loudest frequencies versus time for a short fragment . The frequencies are rounded off here , because 14224 kHz is not going to be distinguishable from 14000 kHz for the purposes of Shazam and your crappy cell mic . Because you obviously do n\'t record the entire song , the actual fingerprint you get on your phone will be a subset of the complete fingerprint of the song . Like this ( random letters used to represent frequencies ) Full song : ABAJUKARWA Clip : UKA ( Note that , at this point , Shazam does n\'t know that the clip and the full song are associated , much less where in the full song the clip appears , but they are presented together for demonstration ) . Note that the fingerprint from your mic is actually pretty close to the real one , even though you just held your crappy cell phone towards the mall speaker for ten seconds . That is for a few reasons : 1 . As previously mentioned , only the loudest sounds are used 2 . Because you \'re not listening to radio static , the song at 59.2 seconds sounds really similar to the song at 59.3 seconds . Therefore the impact of your time intervals not necessarily being aligned with the "" official "" time intervals is reduced . Now , Shazam has invested a lot of money into buying studio music and fingerprinting entire albums . So they have an enormous database of songs and their associated complete fingerprints ( what the loudest sounds are in each small time fragment for the entire song ) . Your phone uploads the fingerprint it took to the Shazam server . Shazam uses a proprietary fuzzy matching algorithm to very quickly search their huge database of fingerprints for portions that are very close to your fingerprint . They do n\'t use an exact match ; they actually use a line similarity algorithm . Basically , imagine the full song as an XY graph with time as X and loudest frequency in that time fragment as Y. Your clip is a small part of that graph . Under studio conditions the lines would be exactly identical . On a crappy cell mic , they wo n\'t be , but : 1 . They will be quite close ( if the song \'s loudest frequency is 20kHz at some point , your mic might might be a frequency band or so up or down , but it \'s not going to be 7kHz ) 2 . They will have the same patterns of rise and fall , 3 . If there are deviations due to loud noises , they will be short ( maybe someone talked or a door opened , but that \'s just a big blip and then it goes back to normal ) . Using these three facts , Shazam is able to do a really , really good job of identifying what song your clip came from , and where . And then it sends back the result ! :)', 'It \'s like a fingerprint . Shazam has a huge library of songs for which it has already analyzed the frequencies and created a "" digital fingerprint , "" like a [ spectrogram ] ( URL_0 ) . When you use it to identify a song , it performs this same analysis on the music it \'s "" listening "" to and compares the results to its library to find the song that matches .

A programming language lets you say how to do something complicated in terms of several simple steps â including steps that are repeated ( "" loops "" ) and steps where you might decide which of two or more things to do ( "" conditionals "" ) . For instance , suppose you are programming a little robot that can move around on a piece of paper . The robot has a pen in its belly , so it draws a line wherever it goes . You would like to get the robot to draw a square . But all it knows how to do is * go forward or back by some number of inches * , and * turn left or right by some number of degrees * . So you have to tell it how to make a square out of those moves . You might write a program like this : to draw_a_square forward 2 right 90 forward 2 right 90 forward 2 right 90 forward 2 right 90 end If the robot runs that program , it will have drawn a square , and ended up back where it started . This is , in fact , a program in the language [ Logo ] ( URL_1 ) , which used to be very popular for teaching programming to grade school students . You can find the Logo programming language [ here ] ( URL_0 ) for Mac , Windows , Linux , and other systems . Remember how I said that you can use repeated steps ? You can use these to make a program shorter , like this : to draw_a_square repeat 4 [ forward 2 right 90 ] end That \'s a lot shorter than the earlier program , but it does the same thing . It \'s shorter because instead of repeating instructions ourselves , we tell the robot to repeat doing them . Programs can also take inputs , for instance , telling how big the square should be : to draw_square : size repeat 4 [ forward : size right 90 ] end Or , even , instead of a square , we could draw an arbitrary regular polygon : to draw_polygon : sides : size repeat : sides [ forward : size right ( 360 / : sides ) ] end So , programs can repeat themselves and they can do different things based on their inputs . They can also control different parts of the computer , for instance sending sounds to the speakers or communicating with other programs over the network .

Combinations of 1 \'s and 0 \'s are the basis for everything that you tell your computer to do . Series of 1 \'s and 0 \'s are convoluted and unfriendly for human users , but they are fantastic for computers . So , people developed programming languages as a means to bridge the gap between what is easy to humans ( writing instructions in an easy - to - read format ) and what is easy to understand for computers ( boolean logic , or 1 \'s and 0 \'s ) . Programming languages can be described as either low - level or high - level . Low - level languages are closer to just writing all 1 \'s and 0 \'s and high - level languages are closer to writing human - readable text . An example of a low - level language is an assembly language and an example of a high - level language is Java or C # . Look at syntax examples of each language to see the difference in readability . For simplicity \'s sake , programming languages then go through a step called compilation that involves parsing the instructions provided in the programming language , tokenizing each piece of the statement , and then making syntactical sense of each token within the larger scheme of the statement . So , the statement : String s = "" foo "" ; gets parsed into the following tokens : * $ 1 = String * $ 2 = s * $ 3 = = * $ 4 = foo * $ 5 = ; After this parsing piece is accomplished , another tool , called a lexical analyzer ( or lexer ) is used to to draw relations between the different tokens based on the rules of the language . So , a java lexer would look at $ 1 and know that it is the beginning of a String declaration . $ 2 would be recognized as a variable , and so on . Once each statement of the program has been parsed and analyzed , it is then translated into 1 \'s and 0 \'s that can be understood by the computer ( or into an intermediary form , such as bytecode ) .

Please explain like I'm five.,"['Cameras can be set up a couple of ways . one way to use them very quickly in unpredictable situations ( Like paparazzi for instance ) is to put a flash on top so you always have enough light , and to let the camera pick your exposure for you so you do n\'t have to take the time to set up the settings . In that sort of mode , when you take the photo , the camera very quickly does a couple of things . First , it starts up the light meter inside the camera . Then , it fires a "" pre flash "" to see how far away the scene / subject is to determine how bright the real flash needs to be , and to set the rest of the parameters in camera ( ISO , aperture , and shutter speed ) When that pre - flash hits the really reflective scarf , a LOT of light comes back at the camera , directly off of the scarf , which tells it that the scene is really bright , and does n\'t need much extra light . So the camera decides to only put out a little bit of light from the flash , and to only let in a little bit of light from the ISO , aperture , and shutter speed , so in the final image , the scarf is exposed correctly , but because nothing else in the scene is so reflective , the rest of the image looks way too dark , and is n\'t usable . It \'s really easy to beat , however , by taking the time to set the camera manually for the exposure you know you \'ll need , or by not using a flash on the camera ( which is how they get the "" before "" photo in the examples ) TLDR : The scarf reflects the flash from the camera and tricks the camera into under - exposing the image so much that it is n\'t usable .', ""It 's made of Scotchlite , which is a fabric designed by 3M.

"How do diamond mines prevent the massive theft of diamonds by the workers ? If diamonds are valuable ( through artificial scarcity ) and very small , why are they not stolen in large amounts by impoverished workers ? Explain like I'm five.","[""A few things to keep in mind : * Diamonds are rarely cleanly unearthed by workers . The workers break up rock which is carted out of the mine for external industrial processing ( further smashing and washing with chemicals ) . * Uncut diamonds are n't nearly as valuable as cut , polished stones . * Also , uncut diamonds are hard for a non - professional to identify and value . It 's easy to mistake them for totally mundane minerals ( and vice versa ) . This is even more true when you 're working in a mineshaft , with little to no light . So at the outset , it 's very hard to come by and identify loose diamonds . It 's not like Minecraft or Terraria . You do n't have valuable diamonds just lying around for the taking . But lets say Miner Joe comes across a small diamond every now and again , which is small enough to smuggle out of the mine . The issue facing him now is whether it 's worth the risk . * * His potential take :* Joe 's diamond is small , uncut , and ungraded , so it 's not exactly a big - ticket item . Plus he has to sell it in his impoverished home country , so he 's not going to get U.S. retail prices . Not even close . Furthermore , if he 's a diamond miner , his buyer may well know that and probably leverage it against him ( i.e. , the buyer could threaten to turn him in ) . So Joe probably takes another hit on the price or maybe he asks a middle man to sell it for him ( for a cut ) . All told , I 'd wager that Joe gets a few hundred bucks for his diamond . Do n't get me wrong - that 's a sizeable chunk of money . But let 's see what he has to lose ... * * The risks :* There are a number of ways Joe could get caught . He could be seen pocketing the diamond by a supervisor , security personnel , or even a fellow miner ( who is probably rewarded for reporting him ) . He also runs the risk of a random inspection - even an X - Ray - as he leaves the mining camp . If he 's caught , he 'll be fired and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law . Given the fact that diamond mining is probably one of the most steady , full - time jobs available to him , and the fact that his country 's justice and penal systems are n't known to be merciful , Joe stands to lose quite a bit . In other words , I think the reward : risk ratio is pretty damn low . I do n't doubt that theft is still a substantial problem , but I think that the opportunity and the benefits for such theft are probably substantially lower than most people think . I 've also read that De Beers and its competitors actually buy up the uncut diamonds sold into the pawn shops and markets in the communities around their mines .

How do PH values actually work ? Why should ( for example ) going from ph7 to ph8 not to be considered an increase by 1 but an increase as an order of magnitude ? Hope my question makes sense . Please explain like I'm five.,"[""When we use acids in water , we like to compare the concentration of protons [ H+ ] . A really important concept when thinking about aqueous acids and bases is a physical constant called Kw , it 's 1x10 ^ -14 , and it is defined as [ H+][OH- ] , i.e the concentration of protons multiplied by the concentration of hydroxyl ( OH- ) ions . This allows us to easily convert between [ OH- ] and [ H+ ] , as their product is constant . If we have a 1.0 M of HCl , then we might anticipate that that will fully break up into H+ and Cl- , giving us [ H+]=1.0M. If we have 1.0 M of NaOH , then we might expect that to fully break up into Na+ and OH- . We want to be able to compare the acidity of the solutions though , so we can convert [ OH-]=1.0 into a value of [ H+ ] using Kw .

The process of taking the logarithm of a number means that you are asking the question ' What power do I have to raise 10 to in order to get this number ' i.e log(10 ^ 6 ) = 6 . pH is defined as -log[H+ ] . There are non - trivial things going on here - the negative sign . This means that the range goes from 0 to 14 , rather than from -14 to 0 . Like so many things in science , we have to define a direction , even though it does n't really matter : we often pick the one that is warmest and fuzziest ( 0 to 14 seems really nice , right ? ) and as long as you can learn and know that a low pH indicates more [ H+ ] than [ OH- ] , i.e. indicates acidic behaviour , then you can use and apply the pH scale as you wish .

Lift is a result of air being forced over the wings , and like I said , the explanation of why airplanes fly explains the first part pretty well . Lift usually counteracts gravity and vice versa . So we 're just going to talk about thrust and drag . In order for a plane to fly it has to have air moving over its wings . This means that you have to have something pushing the plane , usually a propeller or a jet engine . Once the plane starts moving air starts hitting the plane and pushing back against it . This is called drag . At lower altitudes the air is thicker so drag is higher . Climbing to a higher altitude means the engines do n't have to work nearly as hard because there 's less air pushing back against the plane . As a result , planes can fly faster and farther than they can at lower levels . In addition , pilots will also climb to higher altitudes so they can fly over storms or other weather that might make it harder to fly ."", '[ Searched ] ( URL_0 ) Relevant [ discussion ] ( URL_3 ) Original text by [ borntoperform ] ( URL_2 ) > Explain like I \'m actually a five year old playing around with a model airplane , and I ask you how , "" How do planes weigh so much but are able to fly in the sky ?

Thank goodness we have that nice ceiling fan going . Do you notice how the ceiling fan is pushing air around Johnny ? Because the blades are angled it pushes the air down as the fan moves around in a circle right ? So we can picture the fan working like this : > * As the fan spins air is caught by the edge of the fan , the air is forced under the blade . > * Since the fan is still spinning and "" gathering "" more air on the top edge this new air pushes the air that was caught first down . > * This continues and the air flows down the edge of the blade until the edges stops . > * The air does n\'t stop there though .

They spin and push the air that is in front of them behind them . Propellers push much more air than our ceiling fan though . Since they push so much air in one direction they end up moving the plane in the opposite direction , that \'s how planes move forward . You still with me Billy ? > Now that you understand how the propeller works we can talk about the wings . As you can see , the wings are shaped very similar to the blades on our fan and on the propeller . Let \'s pretend our propeller is already running and we are on a very long runway .

The smarty - pants who designed them figured out how to move the air backwards and downwards in order to make the plane go forward and up . Okay Sebastian , I hope you learned a lot . Now go outside and play with your plane , your mother and I have some "" work "" to do .', 'Planes fly by using "" lift . "" Lift is created by a nifty little shape called an airfoil . If you look at an airfoil in a cross - section view , it looks like a horizontal teardrop , but the top is curved more than the bottom ( sometimes the bottom is flat and only the top is curved . ) The principle at work here is that , as this shape moves through the air , the air is split ( think of air as a liquid ) and moves across the top and bottom of the airfoil . However , since the top of the airfoil is curved more than the bottom , the air that travels over the top of the airfoil has farther to travel ( like walking in a straight line as opposed to walking in a curve to get to the same destination ) . Since it has farther to travel , it has to go faster ( like walking in a straight line as opposed to walking in a curve to get to the same destination at the same exact time ) . Since air goes faster over the top of the airfoil , a sort of vacuum is created underneath the airfoil , where the slower - moving air is . This is lift ; it pushes the airfoil shape up from below . So , an airplane \'s wing is just a big airfoil , creating the lift needed to counteract the drag ( friction and stuff of an object moving through the air ) of the airplane and take flight ! All planes follow these principles , but there are many different kinds of propulsion that planes use to get moving fast enough to make the airfoil work ( propellers , jet engines , turbojets , rockets ) . The engine does n\'t make a plane fly though , it just makes the plane move fast enough for the airfoil to create enough lift for the plane to fly . As for why planes fly high , there are many reasons . First , the air is thinner up high , so airplanes are more efficient ( less drag , lift has a greater effect , uses less fuel , travel faster ) . Also , they can fly above most weather , which means no storms or unpredictable wind to deal with . The jet stream and other global wind currents high in the sky also make it worthwhile to catch a ride ( just like the current in Finding Nemo ! ) .']",0,real,0.0067672376,0,True

To clarify though , the statement about investing for a 60 % return is completely wrong . Insurance companies are highly regulated in a number of ways , including the types of investments they can make . The idea is that insurance companies offer financial stability in return for a premium , so if they invest recklessly , lose the money , and are unable to pay claims , then the stability is lost and this is bad for society in general . Overall , about 2/3 ( 66.8 % ) of the investable assets of an average life insurance company are held in cash and bonds . Different kinds of insurers will choose different types of bonds based on their expectations of claims and , without going into too much detail on that , life insurance companies tend to purchase long term ( up to 30 year ) bonds . The three major bond types - treasuries , municipals , and corporate - currently pay an average of 3.44 % , 3.97 % , and 4.49 % , respectively . More info on insurance company investments available at : URL_0 Very plainly , insurance companies have about four percentage points to play with . If we consider that to be a given , then their paid claims and operating expenses can not exceed 96 % of the premiums they charged or they 'll be losing money . Because they can not influence the return on their largest area of investment , there is a serious emphasis put on underwriting and operational efficiency . As for whether or not non - compulsory insurance makes sense , that 's going to vary from person to person . I 'm unmarried with no kids - nobody relies on me for food or shelter . Because of this , the only life insurance I have is what 's provided to me through my employer . If we changed the scenario and I was married with kids and a mortgage , then I 'd likely purchase the life insurance to minimize their financial discomfort in the event I died ."", 'In addition to what ACrusaderA said , keep in mind that a policy holder needs to pay repeatedly and on time to keep their benefits . It is not terribly uncommon for people to forget or to fall on hard times and be unable to pay their premium , in which case all the premiums they paid thus far will not be mitigated by the insurance company paying out later .', ""They invest a lot of money that you give them . Instead of investing $ 100 for 0.01 % return , they invest $ 10 million and get 60 % return .

Skin care is actually one of the biggest challenges in amputee care . In America , the vast majority of amputations are due to vascular disease and diabetes . Most of these patients are older , have poor wound healing from their disease , and may have impaired sensation . A residual limb(stump ) in a prosthetic limb also can become very moist from sweat , which further contributes to skin breakdown . Even young , healthy people who had a traumatic amputation(rather than from vascular disease ) , skin care can be challenging and limit use of their prosthesis . Therefor , prevention is key . We look to maximize the capabilities of both the residual limb and the device . From the moment a surgeon decides(or is forced ) to amputate , skin and soft tissue safety are considered . We know that transtibial(below knee ) amputations do better if they are shaped cylindricallry , while a transfemoral(above knee ) does better if shaped conically . This is because we know through years of experience which areas are prone to breakdown and this way we can reliably predict what the areas of concern will be . At or after the time of surgery , the surgeon will often perform a procedure where extra soft tissue(muscle ) is pulled over pressure sensitive areas to give additional padding . The prosthetic socket and sleeve need to be a nice , snug fit to prevent "" pistoning "" in and out of the leg and irritating the skin . We use drying agents and botox injections to prevent excess moisture in the area . Every time an amputee comes in my office , I do a thorough skin check because a small area of irritation now can become a big problem later . Once you get past the point of a small area of irritation , healing the skin becomes much more challenging and can result in horrible complications - including need for a higher level amputation , loss of ability to walk , or even death .', 'Vet here .

For a vegan human to have a lot of muscle mass is possible , but more difficult . Mainly , they have to focus on eating high protein plants like nuts and beans ."", 'Different species are able to synthesize different nutrients themselves through cellular processes . Nutrients include carbohydrates , fats , proteins ( or their building blocks , amino acids ) , and vitamins . This means instead of the body having to "" eat "" the protein containing a particular amino acid , the cell itself can make that amnio acid . This of course requires energy and work by the cell . Conversely , "" a nutrient is said to be "" essential "" if it must be obtained from an external source , either because the organism can not synthesize it or produces insufficient quantities "" . So there are two kinds of nutrients , those that we can make through our own cellular processes , and those we must obtain through our diet . [ Proteins ] ( URL_2 ) are made up of different [ amnio acids ] ( URL_3 ) . A good analogy is that a protein is like a train , and the individual cars are amnio - acids . Different combinations of railcars , in different orders give different kinds of trains . In the same way , different amnio - acids , in different combinations give different kinds of proteins . Digestion , be it in animals or humans , results in the breakdown proteins into their amnio acid components . The intestine absorbs the individual amnio acids and the body ships these amnio acids to the cells . Cellular processes rearrange the amnio acids in new ways to make new proteins that are used by the animal or human for various bodily functions . So think of the cell as the railyard where new trains ( proteins ) are made but reassembling the cars ( amnio - acids ) into new and different combinations . "" Proteins perform a vast array of functions within living organisms , including catalyzing metabolic reactions , replicating DNA , responding to stimuli , and transporting molecules from one location to another . "" There are [ nine essential amino acids ] ( URL_1 ) that humans must consume in their diet because our cells can not make them through cellular processes . The rest we can make ourselves in our cells . This means that our diet must meet these minimum essential amnio acids requirements in order for us to survive . We can not make the nine , we must consume the nine . The nine are found in all kinds of foods , from plants to meat which is why humans can have such a wide variety of diets ( e.g. vegetarian , vegan , allergen - accomidating ) and still function normally . However , other animals have different essential nutritional requirements . For example , [ cats , unlike humans , can not synthesize the amino acid taurine so it must be added to their diet ] ( URL_0 ) . Some species are able to synthesize Vitamin C and do not need to consume it in their diet ( e.g. mice ) , whereas humans can not synthesize Vitamin C and thus are required to consume it in our diet . These differences in essential nutrient intake creates different dietary requirements for different species and results in different types of foods being consumed preferentially by different species . This is why a horse is able to survive and thrive just on plant material , whereas we are required to consume a more varied diet . They obtain all their unique essential nutrients from their herbivore diet . So other species have different combinations of essential nutrients in order to sustain a balanced and healthy diet . This makes perfect sense , if all species had the exact same requirements there would be a lot of competition for the same food resources . By diversifying what is essential to consume , there is less competition . Remember that it is costly for the body to produce its own nutrients through cellular processes . It is much easier to just consume an amnio acid than produce it . Thus , if a particular amino acid or nutrient is abundant and easily available in a species environment it makes more sense for natural selection to select against the cell \'s producing that nutrient , and for the individual to simply consume it . For example , most primates - including humans - do not synthesize vitamin C. This makes perfect sense since vitamin C is easily acquired through our collective diets by consuming fruit . Fruit is abundant resource in most primate \'s environments thus vitamin C would not be hard to acquire . So each species is balancing what they need to eat , and what they can produce themselves , along with what is available to them in their environment .', ""Herbivores have multiple stomachs with different enzymes that allow them to extract nutrition from fiber .

The answer is that the optimal risk level for any given holding period depends upon a combination of:  Using these two factors, you construct a risk-averse decision model which chooses the risk level with the best expected average outcome, where it looks only at the median and lower percentile outcomes. This produces an average which is specifically robust to downside risk.

The result is specifically valid for the case where you liquidate all of the portfolio at a specific point in time.

Please explain like I'm five.","['The ELI5 version of this is that it interferes with a plant \'s ability to build amino acids . Amino acids are simple ( well , for organic chemistry ) molecules that are combined to form proteins , which are all of the building materials for life . What makes glyphosate , the active ingredient in Roundup , a clever herbicide is that it only acts on what \'s called the "" shikimic acid pathway "" , which is a particular method of synthesizing these amino acids . It turns out that all animals get these particular amino acids from plants in our diet , so glyphosate has no known ill effects in humans - we do n\'t rely on this particular method for our needs . Why is it considered bad : this is complicated . The easiest criticism to understand is that it \'s way , way overused . Essentially , we \'re raining death on the plant world increasingly more in production agriculture , simply because it \'s so effective . Too much of a good thing . It has a tendency to run off of fields when overused , to the point where we \'ve been able to see it in aquifers and streams far from fields , where , presumably , it could still kill plants in a high - enough concentration . It \'s also greatly linked with Roundup Ready plants , plants which have had their genes modified to be resistant to roundup ( the shikimic acid pathway is modified in such a way as for the glyphosate molecules to no longer be as sticky as they are in non - modified plants , so they ca n\'t gum up the works and prevent the amino acids from forming ) . For those who oppose GMO plants , Roundup is sort of an enabler for the technology . Monsanto , the company which produces Roundup and Roundup Ready plants , has a long history of not being very responsible in a "" big picture "" sort of way ( e.g. Agent Orange , DDT , and PCBs were products of theirs as one of a number of chemical companies providing these goods ) , and they \'ve been known to use monopolistic practices in businesses that harm farmers by squeezing their finances from all sides - providing the seeds , providing the Roundup , and ~~owning the grain elevators that take the grain after its grown~~ * * Edit : it was pointed out to me that Monsanto does n\'t actually own the grain elevators . * * _ Hard to keep track of these sort of things : the agriculture business , like all of corporate America , is full of lots of corporation games .

Still , as a herbicide , you ca n\'t get much better than Roundup : it kills plants with no known serious harmful effects on the farmers and field workers who use it . It all has to be taken in context - is it better or worse than backbreaking hand - weeding ? Hard to say definitively . tl;dr : much of what is "" wrong "" with Roundup is due to the political and technological environment in which it \'s being used - sort of how , say , gasoline is not a villainous liquid , but it _ has been _ a big part of global warming due to how we use it .

The front of the Frisbee is splitting the air either above it or below it . The air below exerts air pressure upward , while the air above generates air pressure downward . As it turns out , the upward pressure from the bottom is a little stronger than the downward pressure from the top , so that upward force kinda works against gravity , slowing the frisbee \'s drop . If you want to know why the air on top has such a lower amount of pressure , it \'s explained by Bernoulli \'s principle . Bernoulli studied fluids and pressure or something , and he found out that , while fluids such as air constantly exert pressure outward , movement of the fluid reduces the amount of pressure it can exert . It \'s like it has to redirect the energy required for movement , so it takes it from all the pressure that was sitting around doing nothing . I \'m not great with physics so that \'s about as well as I understand it . Anyway , moving fluids generate less pressure , and the faster they move , the lesser the pressure . So back to frisbees , the top air is moving faster than the bottom air . Why ? Because the shape of the frisbee , kinda curved on top , requires air to move around it , while the bottom air does n\'t have any such obstacle . So the top air loses some of it \'s pressure while moving out of the way of the frisbee \'s "" air foil "" , as we call that shape , and that slight change in pressure causes frisbees to sort of hover in the air like that . This same principle , Bernoulli \'s , explains how air planes fly . That difference in pressure is magnified 1000s of times over by the jet engine pushing it way faster than a frisbee , and eventually that upward pressure becomes stronger than the force of gravity .

How does a float in fuel gauge accurately read fuel level if the car is moving and the fuel is sloshing around all the time ? So here 's how it a fuel gauge works : URL_0 How is this any accurate ? Please explain like I'm five.,"[""First of all , most fuel tanks nowadays are baffled , this is to stop the fuel sloshing about . The reason for this is that modern fuel injection cars must have a constant supply of fuel , if the fuel sloshed about and the pick up pipe is exposed and sucks in some air the engine will ( at best ) cough , potentially it could even stop completely , which is nt good .. Most of the time the fuel sender is placed somewhere near the middle of the tank , so that any effects are minimised . Nowadays the sender is n't directly connected to the gauge , the sender connects to an ECU ( typically the body module ) , this processes the signal from the sender and puts it on the canbus network from where it is picked up by the dash gauges . This does allow for a little processing of the data to go on . I would suggest the ECU probably smooths the signal to remove big spikes , thus giving a more reliable reading .

Explain like I'm five.","['I \'ll tackle the "" why first "" . So , a computer needs to be able to take input and give you output . Whether that \'s deciding what is 2 + 2 or what it should display on screen . Thus , we need a device that translates input to output * automatically * using electricity . I \'ll use a MOSFET transistor as an example , as it is arguably the simplest .

There is an input node * next to * the path we just discussed . It is n\'t on the path , it \'s just reeeaally close by , separated by a small space . When you give that node a positive voltage ( input ) , the pathway unlocks , and the current can flow from the high voltage to ground . Now , how do we use this awesome little device ? Well , you can take a little wire of copper and connect it to the pathway from before just a little bit above the ground node , and run it to a dead end at the input node of a different transistor . This means your first transistor \'s output will determine the next transistors input . You have now created a digital IF ... THEN condition . "" If this happens , then that happens . "" Instead of connecting the bottom of a transistor to ground , you can connect it to the "" power "" node of a different transistor , such that the 2nd is inactive until you give input to the 1st one . Now you have 2 switches that interact with each other based on two sets of input . Mix and match these combos of transistors and you can build "" logic gates "" . AND , OR , NAND , NOR , XOR , XNOR . These transistor networks give a single output based on the combinations of 2 + input . AND : If Bob and Terry want to get dinner , then you will go with them . But if only 1 of them ( or neither ) wants to go , you wo n\'t bother . OR : If either , or both , of Bob and Terry want dinner , you will go . You just do n\'t want to go alone .

At that point , you can now control numbers and IF , THEN conditions , so programming is now possible . Hop , skip , jump , and you \'re at your smartphone . Hope that \'s a coherent overview .

There \'s also some linked videos in the comment chain below that are excellent little classes on the finer points . Visuals help a ton . I \'ll try to drop a comment about the "" magic of chemistry "" in a bit if anyone still wants to know that .', ""The easiest way to think of a transistor is like an electronic switch . You can turn off the flow of current by applying a much smaller current to the transistor . So imagine the flow of current in a circuit like cars on the street . The transistor is a stop light . When the light is green , the cars can flow . When the light is red , they stop . Because electricity wants to keep flowing , with multiple transistors you can control the flow of electricity and use it to perform simple ( or not so simple ! ) tasks . Imagine a circuit with two transistors . You could set it up so that if one transistor is on , a light lights up , and if both are on , two lights light up . Now you 've made an extremely simple calculator that can only do 1 + 1 . Modern electronics are built off of the Integrated Circuit , which is actually thousands and thousands of extremely tiny transistors on a silicon chip . So imagine my silly little two transistor circuit . If you had many more transistors , you could make it do all kinds of things ."", 'Others did Why to death ( i.e. quite well ) but I \'m going to give a stab at the How . ( TL;DR : : A transistor lets one wire "" act like a knob "" to control how much power goes through another wire . ) So you know how they say atoms are "" mostly empty space "" ? Well there are these particles that are really small ( protons , electrons , neutrons ) but they claim a lot of space around them . All of physics and mechanical science and such is about those "" claims "" and how they interact . What do I mean by claim ? You can get very close to a small fire , and even wave your hand through a candle flame , but if you build a great big bonfire there \'s so much heat that you ca n\'t get close . Indeed , if your fire is too big you end up standing out in the cold because the margin between close enough to be warm and too close to be comfortable becomes unworkable . So particles claim space that \'s larger than themselves . One of their primary effective claims is "" charge "" . We talk about positive and negative charges . It turns out that those words "" positive "" and "" negative "" are pretty much arbitrary . ( Many argue that when Ben Franklin assigned the words he got them backwards , but that \'s another topic for another day . ) So an atom is some number of protons ( positive charges ) glued together by neutrons if there is more than one because , um , that \'s how it works . ( i.e. we really do n\'t know why , at the ELI5 level , neutrons are necessary . ) And for every proton the atom wants one matching electron . This is because plus and minus attract and want to make a big zero . On the other hand , physics demands that there be circles ( or really "" clouds "" ) of electrons around every lump of positive stuff if you want that lump to be stable and happy . The first circle needs to be two electrons , then all the rest of the circles need to be eight . Why eight ? Why the exception for two ? More stuff that \'s true with no good ELI5 reason . That conflict , the push - pull between one - plus - one - minus and two - or - eight is how all of chemistry works . When you see a molecule described , like water , H2O , it might be drawn as H - O - H. The little minuses are pairs of electrons , one from each of the neighboring letters . H , hydrogen , is one proton , so it has one electron , which is not two , so it borrows an electron from the Oxygen so its circle / cloud is two . Oxygen is eight positives , so it has eight electrons . It \'s inner cloud uses two so it \'s outer cloud has six , which is not eight . So it borrows an electron from each of the two hydrogens . But wait ! The hydrogen each borrowed one to make two , and the oxygen borrows two , so What the actual fark , amiright ? The electrons are very fast , so they just leap back and forth , doing double duty . So that line is a very hard , very real connection . It \'s like cheating , but it \'s allowed . Like being stuck doing both the grill and the chili at a barbecue . And that \'s basic chemistry . Now silicon ( and other things like it ) are "" Semiconductors "" . They are n\'t good conductors , and they are not bad conductors , they are just so - so . And so "" semi "" . Meh . ( Note that "" meh "" here is relative . Silicon is _ much _ better conductor than air or plastic , but things like gold and copper are just way , way better . ) And if we looked at a perfect crystal of silicon we \'d see a very ordered set of lines . And being all pure like that it barely conducts electricity at all ( compared to say copper ) . That \'s because each electron is exactly doing it \'s job . So we take that pure silicon and "" dope it "" . We force it to accept some non - silicon atoms . Those atoms have just one too many , or one too few protons , which means there are one too many or one too few electrons . So the resultant block has too many or too few electrons . Too many and the block is negative , Too few and the block is positive . Too many and it "" has electrons ( it can share ) "" . Too few and it "" has holes ( that can accept electrons ) "" . Either way , there \'s now more wiggle room for the electrons to literally skitter around and the silicon is a much better conductor than if every electron has its best spot . So what happens when we mash two of those lumps , one positive and one negative , together ? Well the positive part "" borrows "" the electrons from the negative part and it \'s happy but its now back to being crappy at letting electrons through ... in one direction . There \'s the magic ! If I keep putting electrons on the negative side , it can keep lending them to the positive side , and I can suck them out of the far part of the positive side . But if I put electrons into the positive part I just make it even more impossible for the electrons to move around . It \'s weird , but that \'s a "" Diode "" . Now when that two - part lump is sitting there it \'s inherently a match of plus and minus . And when I run electrons in part , and suck them out of the other part , the total amount of plusiness and minusiness of the whole block changes . So I can take that diode and add a _ third _ block of stuff that \'s even _ more _ plussy or minusy than the first two . As long as I put it on the far side of the "" same kind of stuff "" . By that I mean I can do "" Positive - negative - positive "" or "" Negative - positive - negative "" . It \'s got to be three layers and one has to be "" stronger "" than the other two , hence the capital letter . So after I make this three layer sandwich , when I suck electrons out of the center ( in the Npn case ) or add electrons to the center ( in the Pnp ) case , there \'s that diode between the capital letter and the center doing the normal diode thing . But now the second magic bit . As the center gets more electrons added / removed the two ends with the same doping become able to "" see each other "" . Understand that a "" Pp "" or an "" Nn "" block of silicon will just pass the electrons on after wasting some of the energy as heat . So as you feed the interruption in the middle the electrons start to be able to go all the way through . The more you stimulate the middle , the more electricity can get from end - to - end . If you stimulate the middle "" enough "" it \'s like the middle piece was just removed . So what does that practically mean ? At low currents a transistor is an amplifier . Put a little power on the center and a _ proportionally _ larger power can flow from end - to - end . At higher currents , known as the "" saturation current "" , the transistor becomes an on - off switch . So the transistors in your radio amplify the tiny signals received over the air into the big signals necessary to move your speakers and make sound . And the transistors in your computer , being operated at saturation , can do "" logic "" because by using switches in groups you do that AND / OR / NOT stuff . Finally , the smaller a transistor is , they less energy needs to be put on that center part , and the less heat is generated as the electricity flows from N - to - n or P - to - p. So big honking transistors can operate real - world things ( your stereo ) and lots of tiny transistors can become a phone or a computer .']",0,real,0.0062435074,0,True

Now the boss may need access to that office , and others , but does n't want to carry a massive bunch of keys , so you put in a master system . Boss ' key might be cut 5 - 2 - 6 , so you need to add a 3 master pin to the last one so it works for both a 3 & 6 . Then more locks are installed , padlocks here , roller doors there , common areas , etc . So you may need a big master key system . So office guy has key 1 - gets him in the front door & his office only . The cleaner might have a CMK ( cleaner master key ) which gets them through front door , all offices & common areas but not the sheds out the back or padlocks . Warehouse guy might have key 2 which gets access to front gate , warehouse , sheds , but not the offices . Then the boss wants his key to access * everything * - so he has a GMK ( grand master key ) . Gardener needs access , has key 3 which accesses front gate & maintenance sheds only . Whew , what a headache , all these keys & locks .... So , hierarchically , there are potentially lots of different keys that will work through the same single lock , from the base key through to different levels of master key . So you might have key 1 , cmk , mk1 ( master key 1 for bosses lackey ) , gmk . Warning : no - one uses 3pin locks because they are n't very secure . Filling the chambers with master pins allows * any * key to work , but massively reduces security . There is a lot more to it but if I explain it all it 's no longer eli5 but eli - apprentice .

How do wet dreams work ? What is the neurological process the brain goes through ? Please explain like I'm five.,"['Oh jezz , firstly , the testicles do NOT create semen , they create sperm .

Secondly , we know that nocturnal emissions , or wet dreams , are directly related to the amount of time you go without ejaculating / masturbating . The longer you go without ejaculating , the more likely you are to have a wet dream . The exact reason we have wet dreams is n\'t known . The best theory at the moment is that it empties out your prostate so a new fresh batch of sperm and semen can come into being . Sperm does n\'t live very long and semen does n\'t support sperm much longer either , so by removing the old and replacing it with a new "" batch "" is our best understanding as to why . However , I should note that sperm and semen are constantly made , not just when you \'re aroused .

To say those clocks are "" synchronized "" with another clock implies that they \'re close enough to each other so you do n\'t notice the difference between them â less than a minute , by far , and possibly less than a second depending on exactly what kind of clock we \'re talking about .

If they \'re within * ten minutes * of each other , that \'s absolutely fine â¦ and frankly , as long as they \'re within a half hour , it \'s probably not * that * big a deal . So when the battery in your watch dies and you have to reset it , what do you do ? You just look at another clock .

People who * really * care about timekeeping â like the people responsible for maintaining the global positioning system , for instance â have built complex automated ways of doing all that to a high degree of precision . But apart from the automation , the basic process works exactly the same way : pick a reference clock , define a "" close enough "" standard , periodically compare your clock to the reference clock , adjust as needed .', 'The classic ( pre-1950s ) answer is this : 1 . You can tell the local time precisely by observing the sky and doing some math based on the date and your location ( latitude ) . The easiest observation is the position of the sun in the sky . 2 . You can tell the local time at a different location if you know your local time and your location ( longitude ) . So it \'s possible for any location that has an observatory and accurate measurements of its own longitude and latitude to determine what the correct solar time is at any other location on Earth . This is the reason why the agencies responsible for telling the standard time are called "" observatories , "" because telling the time precisely used to mean observing the sky carefully . Two example observatories : * [ United States Naval Observatory ] ( URL_2 ) * The United Kingdom \'s [ Royal Observatory , Greenwich ] ( URL_0 ) . This one is the historically most important one ; we measure longitude relative to this observatory \'s location . Historically , businesses or government agencies that need accurate time got it either directly or indirectly from an observatory . Observatories provide time services that you can use to set a clock . For example , some observatories run special radio stations dedicated to nothing other than broadcasting the time . The USNO runs a [ telephone service ] ( URL_1 ) where you can call an automated voice announcer with accurate time . In the late 19th century and early 20th , railroads were an important means of communicating the standard time . Railroad safety requires accurate clocks , so railroad lines built mechanisms for transmitting the official time to their stations , often with electric systems . So in those days you could set your clock accurately by looking at the train station \'s clocks . After the 1950s things get a bit more complicated , because of the invention of atomic clocks . [ juxtap0zed \'s answer ] ( URL_3 ) explains those ; what it means is that the standard time is no longer directly tied to the rotation of the Earth , but measured with atomic clocks that are more precise than this rotation . The official atomic clocks are operated by a group of observatories in several countries . And since the 1990s there have been two important new ways of getting accurate time : 1 . GPS satellites are atomic clocks that broadcast their time . A GPS receiver can get extremely accurate time . 2 . Many types of cell phone technology rely on having accurate time as well . So it \'s possible to get accurate time by building a machine that listens in to cell phone towers .

How do sail boats go faster than the wind ? The Americas Cup sailboats can go nearly 2 times windspeed . How do they go faster than the wind is blowing them ? Please explain like I'm five.,"[""They are actually sailing parallel to the wind and/or upwind , which is not with the flow of the wind . The sails act like a wing , creating lift which is counteracted by the keel to result in forward motion . Since they are sailing into the wind , they never outrun the wind , instead as they go faster , the apparent wind speed increases . Sailing straight downwind ( with the wind ) , you ca n't go faster than the wind ."", 'The common way that a lot of people think of a sail is as if it were a big parachute . With this conceptualization you have a big sheet of cloth and the wind pushes it from behind . This kind of sailboat can only go as fast as the wind pushes it . However , that \'s the wrong mental picture . The goal of a sail is actually to get the wind to move along the sail , like the air moves over the wing of an aircraft . Just as an aircraft gets lift from its wings a sailboat gets "" lift "" from its sail , but that "" lift "" is directed forward instead of up . This approach does not limit the speed of the boat to the speed of the wind . It even allows the boat to sail nearly directly upwind .', 'There are two basic ways a sail can drive a boat onward . 1 . If the wind is coming from behind , or at not too big an angle behind , the boat , then the sail is trimmed ( basically , aimed ) so that the wind fills the sail from behind . The wind pushes the boat along , as you \'d expect . If the boat were to reach the speed of the wind , any further increase in the boat \'s speed would cause the wind to start pushing it * back * . So , in that configuration , the boat ca n\'t go faster than the wind . 2 . Once the wind is more than about 45 degrees off from the stern ( rear ) of the boat , though , the sail is trimmed such that the * front edge * of the sail is pointing into the wind . The wind is now flowing * along * the sail on both sides of it . As the boat turns further and further towards the wind , the sail gets pulled in further and further , so that its front edge is aimed into the wind and the wind is flowing along both sides . This works until the boat is heading about 45 degrees upwind - that is , the wind is coming in at a 45 degree angle off the bow ( front ) of the boat . How the sail works in this case , I \'ll explain a bit further down . 3 . When the boat is pointing closer than 45 degrees into the wind , that will stop working . You can no longer get the right sail shape , and the wind will just push against the boat and slow it down and eventually stop it . So the people in other comments saying you can sail almost directly upwind are mistaken . You ca n\'t practically sail very close to directly upwind , you have to be a significant angle off . This is why , when boats are trying to get directly upwind , you \'ll see the zigzag , and you \'ll notice each zig and zag is approximately a 90 degree turn - because they \'re close to 45 degrees off the wind in one direction , and then the other , as they work their way upwind . So , how does the sail work when the boat is pointing somewhere between about 45 degrees upwind and 45 degrees downwind ? It \'s all about the shape of the sail . Imagine yourself looking down on the boat from directly above the mast . The wind is blowing the sail into a sort of billow form . If it could , the wind would blow the sail all the way straight in whatever direction the wind is going , like a flag , but it ca n\'t . A sail is not like a flag in a very important way - the bottom of it is attached to a big straight bar , called the boom . So the sail must stay straight at the bottom , all the way to the rear corner . But , and this is just as important , the sail is n\'t a plain flat triangle either . It has a bunch of extra fabric ; it \'s bigger in the middle than is needed to fill the space between the lines if it were just flat . So there \'s extra material to billow out , and the wind , trying to blow the sail off to the side , turns it into a curve . Because of the shape of the sail and how much extra material is in which parts , the sail forms a shape with a sharper ballooning out right at the front , and a shallower curve towards the rear . If you \'re looking at this from above , this shape looks very much like what the cross - section of an airplane wing looks like from the side . It works in the same way . I \'m not going to fully ELI5 how that works right here , but the simplest way to imagine it is that the wind creates * suction * on the rear side of the sail . Think of it like this , sort of : Along the inside of the sail \'s curve , the side in the direction the wind is coming from , the wind is directly hitting the sail and being curved by it . So here , the wind is partly pushing against the sail . But on the outside of the sail \'s curve , the side away from the direction the wind is coming from , the wind going past the mast would just keep on moving past where the sail is , except that direction of motion of the air would pull some air away from the sail . It causes the wind to curve in towards the sail after it has passed it , but it \'s not actually blowing against the sail , it \'s still blowing kind of away from the sail . It \'s pulling air away from the sail . It \'s creating a kind of suction , sucking the sail in that direction . It \'s pulling the sail towards the direction in which it \'s billowing . Now , you might \'ve noticing , looking down at the boat from above , that this direction the wind is sucking the sail towards is n\'t actually directly towards the front of the boat . And you \'re right - if the boat were flat on the bottom , it would start sliding partly sideways , partly forward . But sailboats have something called a keel ( if it \'s permanently fixed ) or centerboard ( if it \'s made to slide into and out of the water ) , which sticks out from the bottom of the boat deep into the water . This keel is a thing but wide blade shape that allows the boat to easily slide forward or backward , but presents a lot of resistance against sliding sideways . So all of the sideways component of the force coming from the sail gets wasted pushing water against the side of the keel / centerboard , but the forward component of the force from the sail moves the boat forward . Even though the boat is actually being pushed at an angle sideways - forward , it only moves forward . Now here \'s the most important part for answering your question : This motion of the wind along the sail on both sides , creating a force that sucks the sail towards where it \'s billowing ... this force is going to keep on being there as long as the wind is flowing along the sail . It does n\'t matter how fast the boat is moving . This force is stronger when the wind is faster , and this force weakens when the wind is slower , but this force is not affected at all by how fast the boat is moving ! It \'s the same amount of suction - force on a boat standing still , or on a boat slowly , or a boat moving fast . If the boat happens to be moving at a speed that happens to be higher than the speed of the wind ? So what ? There \'s no relationship , per se , between the speed of the wind and the speed of the boat in that sense . The only relationship is that the speed of the wind determines how much suction - force acceleration is being applied to the boat . In theory , this could eventually accelerate the boat to "" infinite "" speed ( well , eventually relativity and speed of light limitations start to matter :) , as long as the wind kept flowing along the sides of the sail like that . It does n\'t , of course , because there \'s drag on the boat . That is , resistance to its forward motion , mainly from the water , though somewhat from air too . For any specific amount of forward suction - force , there \'s a maximum speed it can get the boat to , where the amount of force from water and air resistance is equal to amount of forward force from the sail \'s suction , and the boat stops getting any faster . Obviously , the stronger the wind , the faster the boat can go before reaching that point , because the stronger the wind , the stronger the suction - force from the sail . But the point is , that maximum speed is * not * determined by a comparison of the boat \'s speed and the wind \'s speed . Rather , it \'s determined by the relationship between the amount of suction - force you can get from that particular size & shape of sail at whatever the current speed of the wind is , vs. the amount of resistance on the boat ( determined by its mass and design ) . Of course skill matters too , because the boat wo n\'t actually get the true maximum force from the sail . How close it is to the maximum possible , depends on how well the sailors trim the sail to just the right point , and keep up with changes in wind direction , with a combination of subtly steering the boat and moving the sail in or out .']",0,real,0.0066502104,0,True

The odds change on based on how much money is bet for each side . Lets keep the odds where they are . Lets say $ 100 is bet on team A and $ 150 is bet on team B. That means that the bookie is collection 250 in payments . If team B wins , the bookie will pay out 225 dollars in prize money ( 150 x 1.5 ) . He keeps the 25 $ for himself . If team A wins , he pays out $ 200 ( 100 x 2 ) meaning he keeps $ 50 for himself .

The essential way , apart from any particular implementation , is that the bookie ( like a casino ) , does not give absolutely fair odds . Every bettor who wins is paid out less money than the true odds would dictate . The rest is kept by the bookie . For example , if you bet $ 50 on a coin toss , you would not get $ 100 if you win . You would get , let 's say , $ 95 . The man running the game gets $ 50 if you lose and pays $ 45 if you win , so he 's guaranteed to win over time .

A gas turbine is an engine that works by sucking in air with a fan , compressing it along the way , igniting it , and extracting energy from the exploding gasses . Q : what powers the compression fan ? A : At the exhaust , there is another fan . The fans are connected by a shaft , so the expanding gas at the back of the engine twists the shaft , which turns the compression fan in the front of the engine . Q : So the rest of the gas flies out of the back of the engine , pushing the engine ( and whatever it \'s attached to ) forward . A : Not so fast . Some jet engines , like the ones on passenger airliners and jet fighters , do exactly that . But , you can extract the energy from the combustion in another way ! Q : How ? A : By attaching something else you want to power to that fan shaft ! For example , many helicopters and commercial propeller planes have a linkage to that fan shaft that powers a propeller . Yes , some of the energy goes out the exhaust , but the energy used for propulsion is actually sent to the propeller . Q : Wow , these things sound pretty big ! A : They are ! But you might actually have a very simliar device in your car . A turbocharger is like a jet engine without the combusting gas part- it \'s used to compress air coming into your engine so it can burn more fuel .

Crossing the border between North and South is a very bad idea - It 's littered with mines , heavily guarded and it 's almost guaranteed you 'll be shot . Although the Chinese border is also heavily guarded , this factor can be overcome by bribes - normally cigarettes , money and/or food will be sufficient . A position on the Border is a highly desirable role for this reason . Nonetheless , the hardest part is the actual crossing . The Tumen is typically very cold and very deep - if you watch some of the documentaries covering this topic , they may show scenes of the vast number of dead bodies scattered across the river . However , the river is occasionally frozen making the crossing somewhat easier . Once in China , your safety is far from secure .

If you are caught , chances are you 'll be sent to a prison camp and possibly released in the future . However , if caught again it 's almost certain you 'll be executed .

How do we know humans are monogamous ? I have been wondering what actual scientific evidence we have for humans being monogamous . I keep thinking that it is just what we have always been told but is there any evidence that it is so ? Explain like I'm five.,"[""Generally speaking , among primates and most mammals , you can determine whether or not a species is naturally monogamous by the relative size of the male to the female . Gorilla , for example , have much larger males than females . They are polygamous . Same holds for Chimpanzees . This biological reason comes down to the fact that in a polygamous system , males have to compete for not only the best females but for all the females . Thus , being larger guarantees success . In a monogamous species , all males and females ( each roughly 50 % of the population ) have equal access , and males and females tend to be the same size . So , humans are naturally polygamous , from a biological perspective . But before you start blaming religion and society , recall that monogamy in humans actually predates religion and even agriculture as part of human society . So how do we explain this ? Well , consider the first humans who started living together in defined groups . Maybe they create a camp . Discovery of fire , etc . By this point , their tools and social structure has already put them on the apex of their environment . They have no natural predators anymore , and the population is already beginning to boom . Which means that back then ( as today ) there existed a certain scarcity of resources which would later be solved by agriculture . Now , when we have a scarcity of resources , we have competition . In this case , between two or more different GROUPS , or tribes , of humans . Which means that now we need to ensure that our tribe , not just the individual , is the most fit . This means that we need two things : a stable population size ( lots of warriors ) and genetic diversity ( healthy warriors ) . This does not happen if you have , say , a harem - type polygamous system . Because even though one man can get all the women in the tribe pregnant ( you know , if he HAS to ) , that 's going to ensure that the next generation has very low genetic diversity ( They 're all half - siblings ) . If this continues , one tribe is going to be significantly inbred , and we all know what that looks like . So , consider two tribes . One tribe , as part of their social structure , is fine with letting the chief ( biggest male ) have all the women . Another tribe , by chance , pairs up men and women via a ceremony ( early marriage ) . Each tribe lives 5 generations until they come together and have a war . Who is more likely to win ? The second tribe . Project this over a hundred and fifty thousand years of human pre - history , and it becomes advantageous for humans , who as animals are naturally polygamous , to become monogamous for the good of the tribe , which is a novel organizational level that genetics has n't accounted for . An voila , the paradox is solved . Sort of . See , monogamy was required for the survival of tribes and small social systems . But today , we no longer have tribes . We have vast and genetically diverse cities and towns and nations worth of potential sexual partners , and absolutely ZE - RO need to fear for long - term inbreeding . All the while , our animal brains are telling us to be polygamous , an instinct which is not likely to ever go away . Hence , you know , all sexual drama of the last ten thousand years . Why do we do it ? Because the social structure that were NECESSARY to keep tribes together and functional ( religion , government , etc ) became by necessity aligned with monogamy . And we have n't yet separated those two ideas . Yet being the key word . tl;dr : We are naturally polygamous . We once needed to be mongamous to survive .

HBO makes money by charging individual households a monthly fee just to get HBO , so its pretty direct link from the show to the money . If you want to see an HBO show , you pay HBO for it .

Bigger audiences = more money to buy advertising time during that show . ( The age range of the audience , gender , income level , etc also all effect advertising prices ...

A * license * is an agreement to use something without owning it . The word * license * actually means "" permission . "" So a TV licensing deal is letting the network play the TV show with permission of the owners . Most of the time , the license fee is less than the cost of the show . TV production companies operate in * deficit finance * which is a fancy was of saying they are losing money through much of the life of the show . On a free broadcast channel , the network makes a profit by selling advertising on the show . They want a good show , so many people will watch it . The more people watch , the more people see the ads , and the more the network can charge for the ads . The production company gets none of the ad money . They get their license fee . But the license fee is usually for permission to broadcast the show only twice . After the second showing , the network does n\'t have permission to show it again . Now , the production company can license the show to a smaller network or a cable company . The real money for the production company comes if the TV show makes 100 or more episodes . Then when the network license expires , the production company can license the show to * syndication . * A syndicate is a group of buyers who pool their money to buy something that none of them could afford by themselves . Like everyone chipping in to buy a pizza . TV syndicates are companies that represent small , local TV stations all over the country who want to license TV shows .

Jerry Seinfeld \'s share of the profits from his TV show \'s syndication deal is said to be $ 250 million . That \'s just his share . It \'s a lot of money . After syndication , the production company can license the show to streaming and shiny disc home video . That can be a lot of money , too , just not as much as syndication . HBO and Netflix do it differently . They are both the owner and the broadcaster of the TV show . They do not show ads . Instead , they charge people to subscribe and watch their shows . HBO and Netflix analyze the cost of the show against the number of people who sign up to watch . Their accountants figure out how much money the TV show is bringing in . Based on that , they decide whether to keep making the show . HBO and Netflix do n\'t sell to syndication .

The network then sells $ 7 million worth of ads to run during the show . For shows on HBO or Netflix , instead of selling commercial air time , they sell subscriptions to access the show ... so millions of subscribers pay $ 10 - 20/ month depending on the channel and platform and that money funds the production of the shows .

How does a high share price benefit a company when it is raising funds?,"['Share price is based on demand.  Assuming the same amount of shares are made available for trade then stocks with a higher demand will have a higher price.  So say a company has 1000 shares in total and that company needs to raise $100. They decide to sell 100 shares for $1 to raise their $100. If there is demand for 100 shares for at least $1 then they achieve their goal. But if the market decides the shares in this company are only worth 50 cents then the company only raises $50. So where do they get the other $50 they needed? Well one option is to sell another 100 shares. The dilution comes about because in the first scenario the company retains ownership of 900 or 90% of the equity. In the second scenario it retains ownership of only 800 shares or 80% of the equity. The benefit to the company and shareholders of a higher price is basically just math. Any multiple of shares times a higher price means there is more value to owning those shares. Therefore they can sell fewer shares to raise the same amount.  A lot of starts up offer employees shares as part of their remuneration package because cash flow is typically tight when starting a new business. So if you\'re trying to attract the best and brightest it\'s easier to offer them shares if they are worth more than those of company with a similar opportunity down the road. Share price can also act as something of a credit score. In that a higher share price ""may"" reflect a more credit worthy company and therefore ""may"" make it easier for that company to obtain credit.

I may have no idea what "" cerveza "" means , but if I hear a spanish speaker say it and then receive a beer I can have a pretty good idea .', 'One big piece of language learning is tied to our conceptual vocabulary . Conceptual vocabulary is our ability to apply meaning and context to an item , an action , an emotion , etc . in the world around us . For example , I could hold up a banana and depending on your knowledge and exposure to that banana or the banana industry or facts about banana , you \'d know that green bananas do n\'t normally taste that great , that most bananas we see are yellow and if a banana is black or mushy to the touch it \'s probably bad . Assuming your conceptual vocabulary veers towards normal , you \'d know you ca n\'t write with a banana and you ca n\'t drive a banana . This is based on an entire lifetime of seeing bananas , eating bananas and just in general , your brain \'s natural association with an abstract sound connecting to a piece of our reality that associates meaning back to our brain . When we learn language as a child , our brains are connecting the dots between the language around us and the world around us . That \'s why it \'s so important to expose kids to a variety of different experiences , as well as explaining those experiences and things to the child . Babies and kids need to hear and interact with language while growing up because it activates their brain for more language . The usual rule is that kids really need to be exposed to vast amounts of language and experiences by age 5 because our brains are hardwired to use those first five years to really absorb all those really complicated parts of a language , such as grammar and cultural factors and social cues . Research has been done on young children about their understanding of grammar and it \'s amazing how they understand really complicated abstract grammar simply based on them knowing what "" sounds "" right and what "" sounds "" wrong . That \'s based on exposure , parents and adults teaching them how to use it , correcting them when they use it wrong . If you want to read up more about this need for constant stimulus required for language development , you can look into the story of Genie .

Her language skills improved while some researchers were working with her , but once the researched stopped and she was put in a home for the mentally ill , her skills rapidly regressed because she just was n\'t being exposed to language anymore . If you \'re talking about how we can move to a different country and slowly grow to learn the language , it \'s about how we \'re connecting the dots of the new language around us with our existing knowledge of conceptual vocabulary as well as our understanding of our first language . It \'s similar to how we learn language as a child , but since we already have our first language , learning a second language is more based on connecting the world , our existing language and our conceptual language together . That \'s why learning nouns and verbs are always easier when learning a second language , while grammar is probably a bit more difficult when it \'s not related to our first language .

When someone moves to another country , if they completely immerse themselves , meaning no exposure to their first language , then they will pick up the language so much faster compared to someone who frequents ex - pat areas or still uses their first language to write and read . Conversing with fluent speakers helps us test our language ability and for us to read and note when we say things right and when we say things wrong .

How do explosions kill people ? I guess it makes sense when you 're standing in extremely close proximity to the actual explosion . What I do n't quite get is how people in the general area of a bomb explosion get thrown into the air and killed . Explain like I'm five.,"['First , the whole "" getting thrown into the air "" thing is just a Hollywood stunt effect . You \'re not actually going to be lifted off your feet more than a couple of inches unless the explosion is underneath you . The primary way an explosion will kill you is the shockwave . A wall of compressed air comes racing away from the explosion at high speed . When this shock wave hits your body it \'s going to damage your internal organs . Secondarily , you can be hit with shrapnel and debris . For example , grenades do n\'t generally kill with the explosion itself . The metal shards around the explosive fly off in all directions and will kill you that way .', ""When a bomb goes off , the small mass of explosives expands rapidly as it is turned into a gas . It 's the same thing that happens in a campfire when a small log turns into a huge amount of smoke and other gases . However , the stuff that bombs are made of is specially designed to turn into gas in the blink of an eye . When this expansion happens it pushes all the air that was around the bomb before it went off out of the way . This creates wind that moves extremely fast , often times faster than the speed of sound . This superfast moving air tries to push the air in front of it out of the way , but that air ca n't move out of the way fast enough so it piles up into much thicker , high pressure air . Imagine a snowplow driving down the street , but instead of the snow getting thrown out of the way , it keeps piling up on the front of the plow and gets heavier and more tightly compacted . This air is moving so fast , and is so tightly compacted , that when it hits a person , it 's like getting hit by a solid object . It can either rip them apart , or shake them so violently that there insides turn to mush . To better understand this , think about what it feels like when you stick your hand out of a car window .

How do markets âfactor inâ a future event?,"['At the most fundamental level, every market is comprised of buyers and selling trading securities. These buyers and sellers decide what and how to trade based on the probability of future events, as they see it. That\'s a simple statement, but an example demonstrates how complicated it can be. Picture a company that\'s about to announce earnings. Some investors/traders (from here on, ""agents"") will have purchased the company\'s stock a while ago, with the expectation that the company will have strong earnings and grow going forward. Other agents will have sold the stock short, bought put options, etc. with the expectation that the company won\'t do as well in the future. Still others may be unsure about the future of the company, but still expecting a lot of volatility around the earnings announcement, so they\'ll have bought/sold the stock, options, futures, etc. to take advantage of that volatility.  All of these various predictions, expectations, etc. factor into what agents are bidding and asking for the stock, its associated derivatives, and other securities, which in turn determines its price (along with overall economic factors, like the sector\'s performance, interest rates, etc.) It can be very difficult to determine exactly how markets are factoring in information about an event, though. Take the example in your question. The article states that if market expectations of higher interest rates tightened credit conditions... In this case, lenders could expect higher interest rates in the future, so they may be less willing to lend money now because they expect to earn a higher interest rate in the future. You could also see this reflected in bond prices, because since interest rates are inversely related to bond prices, higher interest rates could decrease the value of bond portfolios. This could lead agents to sell bonds now in order to lock in their profits, while other agents could wait to buy bonds because they expect to be able to purchase bonds with a higher rate in the future.  Furthermore, higher interest rates make taking out loans more expensive for individuals and businesses. This potential decline in investment could lead to decreased revenue/profits for businesses, which could in turn cause declines in the stock market. Agents expecting these declines could sell now in order to lock in their profits, buy derivatives to hedge against or ride out possible declines, etc. However, the current low interest rate environment makes it cheaper for businesses to obtain loans, which can in turn drive investment and lead to increases in the stock market. This is one criticism of the easy money/quantitative easing policies of the US Federal Reserve, i.e. the low interest rates are driving a bubble in the stock market. One quick example of how tricky this can be. The usual assumption is that positive economic news, e.g. low unemployment numbers, strong business/residential investment, etc. will lead to price increases in the stock market as more agents see growth in the future and buy accordingly. However, in the US, positive economic news has recently led to declines in the market because agents are worried that positive news will lead the Federal Reserve to taper/stop quantitative easing sooner rather than later, thus ending the low interest rate environment and possibly tampering growth.  Summary: In short, markets incorporate information about an event because the buyers and sellers trade securities based on the likelihood of that event, its possible effects, and the behavior of other buyers and sellers as they react to the same information. Information may lead agents to buy and sell in multiple markets, e.g. equity and fixed-income, different types of derivatives, etc. which can in turn affect prices and yields throughout numerous markets.']",0,real,0.6725253,1,False
How do physicists entangle particles in quantum entanglement ? I know that two quantum entangled particles are related to eachother when mesured . But how are these particles made ? Please explain like I'm five.,"['This is an excellent question and very hard to explain at an elementary school level . With that said , let \'s start off by saying that two particles are considered entangled when their correlations satisfy Bell inequalities . This does n\'t answer how to explain it without knowing what correlations or bell inequalities are , but it \'s the technical working definition . Picture two light particles separated by a very large distance , and measure their polarizations . If they \'re so far apart that light could not have gone between the two of them in the time it took you to measure their polarization , AND their is a relationship between the two polarizations , then they are entangled . So we know how to tell if they \'re entangled . So how do we actually entangle them ? One way is through quantum interference . In quantum mechanics , the "" state "" of a particle is represented by a "" wavefunction "" . Unlike an electric wave , there is nothing we know of that is actually waving . It does tell you the probability of measuring a particle or particle properties , though . Since it \'s a wave , however , it posses wave properties like interference . If a crest and trough line up , the wave amplitude goes to zero at that point . One experiment where they tested this was the "" Hong - Ou - Mandel "" experiment . They sent two identical photons in two sides of a "" beamsplitter "" ( a device which splits light 50:50 ) and measured how often the two photons came out different sides or the same side . It turns out that the path for photons to come out different sides ( since there \'s two ways for that to happen ) cancel out , and you only ever see two come out either side . The final state of the system is entangled : the two possible output states are in an equal "" superposition "" . There are other ways of entangling particles , though . Another commonly cited entanglement phenomena is in positronium ( an electron and its antiparticle orbiting each other ) . When the electron and positron ( anti - electron ) annihilate they have a certain probability to emit two photons in opposite directions with unknown but correlated polarizations . That is , when you measure the two photons they will always have polarizations at 90 degrees to each other no matter how far apart they are .', ""The simplest example I can think of is by creating two particles that are entangled when they are made . If you 're not familiar with spin , it 's a number that is a measure of angular momentum . You can think of it as just an intrinsic property of particles without actually worrying about what it means . You take a particle(s ) with spin of 0 , then turn it into two particles having spin of , say , 1 . An example might be electron - positron annihilation . If the electron has a spin of +1/2 and the positron has a spin of -1/2 , the total spin of the system is 0 . When they run into each each other they will make two photons . Each photon must have spin of +1 or -1 . There 's a law that says that the total spin of a system must be conserved , the same way energy is conserved . Because the spins have to be 0 , this forces one of the photons to be +1 and the other to be -1 , they ca n't both have the same spin . The thing is , the quantum nature of the photons mean we do n't know which one is which , furthermore , they do n't have a well defined spin until something actually measures it . Say we go in and measure one of the photons . It could be either spin , but let 's say when we measure it as +1 , this forces the second particle to be of spin -1 . If we had measured the first as -1 , the second would be +1 . The key is that neither of these particles had a well defined spin until the moment it was measured , at which point it forced the other to be the opposite direction ."", 'From what I know there are many different ways to entangle "" particles""(You got ta be carefull with that term since quantum objects can be seen as wave and particle ) . One possibility to entangle photons is per example the so called \' Spontaneous parametric down - conversion \' , where photons pass through a ( nonlinear ) crystal and have a chance to become two entangled photons with opposite polarisation . Another possibility is one or more objects that emmit two new objects , which are entangled . This can be an p.e . a molecule which gets "" destroyed "" into two atoms which are entangled or a particle and a anti - particle which \' destroy \' each other and emmit two photons .

"How do computers read and "" produce "" the 1 and 0 they use to send commands ? I understand they use 1 's and 0 's , but where do they come form , and what exactly are they ? Explain like I'm five.","['Well the 1s and 0s are ways we have of thinking about information as if it could only be one of two different things . Exactly what we represent with which bit is n\'t important , as long as you understand that 1 is not 0 , and 0 is not 1 . Where they come from , on the other hand , is from any number of places a computer can interact with . For example , computers run on electricity , so when a computer wants to send information from one place to another it sends these "" pulses "" of electricity over a wire . A higher voltage pulse will mean a 1 , and a lower voltage pulse will mean a 0 . But there are other parts of a computer that still use 0s and 1s that are n\'t electric , like the hard drive . The hard drive stores 1s and 0s by changing the magnetic poles of small parts of a metal disk . Positive and negative charges would be 1s or 0s . So you can see how these real - life things can be changed to represent bits . Now you \'re probably wondering why , and what significance do bits have ? How can a 1 or a 0 be turned into important information ? Well , I \'m lazy , and I happen to already have an ELI5 explaining the nature of information to someone who was asking how DNA can be turned into information : URL_0 However , in summary , we use combinations of bits and say that different combinations have different meanings . So we might say that 0010 means the number 2 , and 0011 means the number 3 ( which it does , and there is strange math involved that requires re - learning how to count ) . From there , as long as everyone agrees that this is the case and these combinations do mean these things , we can start to make bigger groups of these bits that can be interpreted as instructions that can make computers do different things . Hope this helps ! EDIT : confusing sentence structure fixed', ""The way it worked in original computers was that you had racks of vacuum tubes wired up together which would make up the computers memory . Each one of these vacuum tubes is a single bit ; that is , a single on / off , yes / no , 1/0 . The computer could read and write the on / off state and represent it as 1 's and 0 's . Now with disk ~~and solid state~~ hard drives the concept is the same but instead of checking the on / off state of a vacuum tube , it checks the magnetization of the disk . edit : TIL solid state drives are a whole different beast ."", 'Computers do n\'t necessarily "" produce "" 1 \'s and 0 \'s in the sense that they do n\'t manufacture them . Rather , they "" present "" hardware states that are interpreted as numbers . By state , I do n\'t mean a state like Texas , I mean a particular condition that a hardware piece is in at a specific time . For example , think of a light switch . It can be in either two states : up or down . For the sake of this example , consider up to be on , and down to be off . The state ( or condition ) of the switch is determined by the physical position of the switch . Now , flipping the switch does n\'t produce 1 \'s and 0 \'s , but we can interpret the position of the switch such that on=1 and off=0 . An item that can only have two states can be considered binary . In computers , a single binary unit is referred to as a bit . Multiple bits can be grouped together to store numbers larger than 1 . When this happens we are using base - two ( binary ) counting . When you count with your fingers , you \'re essentially using base-10 ( decimal ) counting that you \'re familiar with . Now , think of a wall with one of those panels that have two light switches on them . Again , flipping the switches does n\'t produce 1 \'s or 0 \'s , but we \'re going to interpret the position of each switch as to represent a 1 or 0 . With two switches there are four possible combinations or 2 X 2 = 4 or , more accurately , 2 ^ 2 = 4 : * Switch 1 : on or off * Switch 2 : on or off Although we have 4 possible states , we typically consider the state with everything off as 0 . * State 1 : Switch 1 off and Switch 2 off = 0 * State 2 : Switch 1 on and Switch 2 off = 1 * State 3 : Switch 1 off and Switch 2 on = 2 * State 4 : Switch 1 on and Switch 2 on = 3 In computers , a cluster of 8 bits ( think switches ) is called a byte . With a byte , we can have up to 256 possible states since we can have up to 256 different possible combinations of bits being on or off . There are many different types of hardware for storing binary data , but they essentially can all be thought of as machines with lots and lots and lots of tiny switches in them . In computers , everything is based on binary numbers . In order to keep everything being one giant confusing number , we reserve groups of bits for different purposes . To explain this , I \'ll use a city metaphor . Feel free to draw things out on a piece of paper as you follow along . Imagine you are standing outside of a single story building , at night , with 8 windows in a line . If the light in a room is turned on , the room will light up . Think of each room as a bit . If you see it lit up , you interpret it as a 1 . If it \'s dark , you interpret it as 0 . Since you have 8 bits , the building effectively represents a byte of data . Now imagine the same building , but with 2 floors instead of 1 . You have 2 rows of 8 windows , with each window representing a bit . Remember how I said earlier that you can have 256 possible combinations with 8 bits ? Now we have 2 rows of 8 bits , or 16 bits . With 16 bits , we can have 2 ^ 16 = 65,536 possible combinations , which is also the maximum value we can store ( all bits are turned on ) . Lets designate this building as "" Storage 1 "" . Now , imagine an identical 2 story building right next to it called "" Storage 2 "" . Now we have 2 buildings of 16 bits , or 32 bits total . However , we \'ve effectively reserved each group of 16 bits into separate groups . Next , we have a 3rd building with a single story of 2 windows , or 2 bits , called "" op_code "" and a 4th building with 4 floors of 8 windows . This single building effectively contains 32 bits by itself . We \'ll call this one "" result "" . Result is different than storage 1 and 2 and op - code in that it \'s read - only . Imagine the building is locked and you do n\'t have the key to get in . As a result , you ca n\'t set the switches yourself to turn the lights on and off , you can only look at them . Finally , we \'ll have a small square building with no windows . We \'ll call this one "" compute "" . Inside there are special switches called logic gates . Logic gates take 1 or more input switches and usually have a singular output switch that is read - only . This effectively means that while you can set the input switch or switches , you ca n\'t set the output switch , only look at it . Feel free to look up the different types of logic gates yourself . For right now , it \'s sufficient to say that logic gates can be combined and arranged in different ways to perform mathematical operations . To recap : two identical 2 - story buildings containing 16 windows each called storage 1 and storage 2 , a 4 - story building containing 32 windows by itself called result a small square building called compute , and finally a single story building with 2 windows in a row , called op_code . You can think of each of these buildings as a representation of a type of computer chip . Modern computers use special chips called "" system on chip "" meaning a single chip has several internal "" chips "" inside of it . Each of these "" system on chips "" is like an electronic city unto itself . However , computer chips do n\'t have eyes and ca n\'t "" see "" bits . Instead , they are wired together so that when a bit is on , electricity flows through it . Imagine that each window in storage one and storage 2 has an extension cord connecting it to the compute building , All 16 wires from each storage building are plugged into a single side of the compute building . Storage 1 is plugged into side one of compute building and storage 2 is plugged into side 2 of compute building . If you were to turn on the a light in one of the storage buildings , it would also send power through that room \'s extension cord to the compute building . Now , imagine that the op - code building has 2 wires ( one for each window ) wired up to the third side of the compute building . Finally , the 4th side of the compute building is wired up to the result building . Since op - code has 2 windows , we have 4 possible combinations . We \'re going to let each combination represent a command : * 1 : off - off ( 00 ) is do nothing * 2 : off - on ( 01 ) is add storage 1 and storage 2 * 3 : on - off ( 10 ) is subtract storage 2 from storage 1 * 4 : and on - on ( 11 ) is multiply storage 1 and storage 2 . All operations except off - off cause the lights in the result building to reflect the binary result of the operation . For example , using the add op - code ( off - on ) causes the lights in result to indicate the sum of storage 1 and storage 2 . As an example , Imagine that you running around this imaginary town . You turn on the lights in storage one and storage two such that the windows look like this ( 1 is lit - up ): * Storage 1 : * 00000000 * 00000011 * Storage 2 : * 00000000 * 00000001 Next you run to the op code building and flip the light switches so that it has the following binary value : 01 Remember , 01 is to add . Unseen to you , 01 has allowed the power from storage 1 and storage 2 to be routed to the logic gates used for addition in the compute building . Consequently the windows on the result building look like this : * 00000000 * 00000000 * 00000000 * 00000100 By doing so , you \'ve effectively added 11 ( binary for 3 ) and 1 ( binary for 1 ) , resulting in 100 ( binary for 4 ) . You should now have a very basic understanding of how computers operate . Lots of bits , groups of which are reserved for different things , are wired together such that other groups of bits act as commands to perform computations . If you want to understand how text and other things are represented , look at an ASCII chart . Effectively , a byte is used for a single character . Each possible combination of the bits within the byte is reserved to represent a different character . It \'s still all binary numbers , is just that when people design computers to be compatible with each other , they agree to bind their designs to conform to standards like ASCII .

This can usually be fixed by a reprogramming tool ( for newer vehicles ) Some vehicles use GPS based speedometers . But I do n't believe this is a very common thing . In this case wheel size has no effect ."", ""There are three possible methods a car could use . I 've heard of GPS speedometers which constantly determine your position on the Earth then divide the distance between two coordinates found by the time between when each coordinate was found . I 've never seen one of these , only heard rumors they exist in vehicles . The main problems with this method are remaining connected to the GPS satellites and getting precise data . Many GPSs have a poor spatial resolution , meaning they will know your location to within a fairly large distance of possibly thirty feet or more . In addition , because the signals used for communication are so weak when they arrive , ( satellites are really far away ) , if you are in a tunnel , under a bridge , in a city with a lot of tall towers , or experiencing bad weather , you could lose the signal . These problems make me doubt these systems are actually used in vehicles . This method does not rely on the wheels ' radius . Another method is to have one or more magnets attached to a shaft somewhere in the powertrain . When these magnets rotate , they induce electric currents in a coil of wire as they pass by it . Each time a magnet passes by this coil , a pulse of electricity is generated . The frequency of these pulses can be measured , and if the gear ratio between the shaft and the wheels is known , and if the radius of the wheels is known , the rotational speed of the wheels can be determined mathematically . The third method involves more magnets and a larger coil of wire . When the magnets on a shaft are rotating , they induce an electric current in a coil of wire , ( this time , the current is continuous , not pulsed . ) This electric current is amplified and used to heat a strip of metal . This metal strip actually consists of two different types of metal sandwiched together . When the strip heats up , the metals expand , but each of the two metals expands by a different amount causing the strip to bend . The strip is connected mechanically to the speedometer , so when the strip bends , the indicator moves . The amount it moves is ultimately dependent on the speed of the shaft containing the magnets , as is the speed of the vehicle . This method also relies on having a known wheel radius .

You still have to pay for the drinks but they cost less and they give you more . Now , let 's say there is no bouncer at the door to stop people from coming in without paying and drinking at the same discount rate that you do . After a while the bartender 's do n't know who is who and have to close the club so they can figure out who is paying . Sim cards hold specialized data that is specially encrypted based on the company . The sim card ( which has a specially assigned ID called an iccid number ) is registered with your phone number and encryption key . This key is transmitted to the cell tower which has a registry of every key and every number . Once verified the call is routed to the destination line and the other user answers or declines . This is why sometimes when you call there is a slight delay before the ringing begins . The wavelengths and info are more in regards to how the information travels and not regarding to the card itself . LTE uses sim card technology but that has to do with the standardization of the frequencies and technology . Same principal applies for those as well . Hope this helps . Feel free to ask me anything if you need more info ."", ""A sim card is your subscriber identity module and it contains part of a 2 part key that is necessary to join a mobile network . The SIM is used for the cryptographic authentication and handshaking with the network and it is one of the reasons why it 's not possible to listen in on peoples wireless telephone conversations . The listening party would need the private and public key the other subscriber is using in order to decode the connection . SIM cards are issued to a carrier and are also linked to your IMSI and MSISDN numbers in the subscriber database for billing and features . This allows a company to give different sim cards to different customers on the same network for billing purposes . For instance pay as you go companies like Boost Mobile and many of the other telco 's that are n't T - mobile , AT & T , Verizon , or Sprint do n't actually own any networks . They instead use another networks infrastructure to piggy back on , and that network gives those users sim cards that attach them to the third parties billing and network capabilities . In other words hypothetically a Boost mobile subscriber and a T - Mobile subscriber might both be on a Tmobile network , but the Tmobile infrastructure treats the Boost sims differently and bills differently than if the same subscriber had a t - mobile sim .

How do wireless providers make money from MVNOs ? Would n't creating competition that undersells your own same product while also using your own network be bad for business ? Explain like I'm five.,"['MVNO \'s are based on the internal accounting principle that every cost shall be applied to the business unit that consumes the good or service . Basically , think of Sprint ( which is the major network company that serves MVNO \'s ) as two companies : a wireless network operator , and a wireless service retailer . The network operator builds , maintains and operates the network . The wireless service retailer buys service from the network operator , and resells it to retail customers in the form of cell phone contracts . Using the aforementioned accounting principle , the network company \' buys \' the network ( by building it ) and \' manufactures \' wireless service ; the retail company buys finished wireless service from the network and resells it to consumers . It \'s similar to how car manufacturers work - Ford builds a car , then sells it to a dealer wholesale , who then sells it to a consumer , retail . Ford makes a profit when they sell it to the dealer , and the dealer makes a profit when they sell it to the consumer . In actuality , the dealer \'s profit on the sale of a single car is often larger than Ford \'s profit on the same single car is , but Ford sells millions of cars , whereas the dealer sells maybe a few hundred . The MVNO goes to Sprint ant says "" I can buy the wireless service from your network division for the same amount that your internal retail division does , but I can add value ( lower cost , better service , different phones , different payment methods , etc ) that your retail division ca n\'t or wo n\'t . "" Sprint likes this , because it helps earn extra revenue for the network , without doing things it might not like to do ( eg , cutting prices , or changing policies that discriminate against lower - income consumers ) . So your question starts from a few flawed premises : > creating competition Most of the MVNO \'s on Sprint \'s network ( for example ) do n\'t compete with Sprint ( they are going after a different market segment - usually pay - as - you - go customers who do n\'t or ca n\'t get contracts ) . > undersells your own same product They are underselling the retail division , but they pay at least the same rates as the retail division does for network access - and potentially more . In addition , the MVNO \'s probably have to make volume commitments ( ie , guarantee that they will buy $ X Million in service per annum ) which is great for your balance sheet because big commitments are cheaper than a bunch of small ones . > using your own network be bad for business ? From the perspective of the network company it is n\'t , because they are getting paid more money for the same network service ( ie , they have to pay for the network regardless of how many users are on it , by getting more users they are able to spread the cost of maintaining the network over more users and thus increase profitability ) . It \'s actually a kind of \' best of both world \'s \' mode . Vertical integration actually sucks for shareholders . Wall Street and banks like it , but in the long run it destroys the company through stagnation .', 'It \'s actually a pretty clever tactic . If you were selling things , would n\'t it be great to be able to only show people your expensive items , until you were sure they were n\'t going to buy from those , and then ( and only then ) , show them your less expensive items ? This is basically what having MVNOs allows the providers to do . A lot of wireless customers will just go to the nearest Verizon ( or AT & T or Sprint ) store and sign - up for whatever plan seems the most affordable with the right features . By limiting the plans ( and price points ) they offer , providers can push people into buying more than they need ( or paying more than they should for what they need ) . Doing that causes a lot of people to say , "" Never mind , I guess I do n\'t need a cell phone . "" By allowing MVNOs to exist , the providers can "" recapture "" these lost customers . Getting a customer that pays less than you want is always better than not getting them at all . It took me a looong time to get a cell phone . I wanted a cell phone for * very * occasional use . Like , I might make a 5 minute call once a week or so . I was n\'t willing to pay more than about $ 10 / month for that , though . None of the providers had anything for me . About two years ago I discovered a Sprint MVNO that had what I was looking for . I had n\'t known about MVNOs before that time , or I would have been a customer sooner . Because of that MVNO , Sprint got some of my money rather than none of it . So it was a win for Sprint ( and me ) . The providers need to be careful ( and they are ! ) that they do n\'t lose too many customers to the MVNOs . When they balance it right , they get more profit than they would if they just made a perfect - fit plan for every possible customer themselves .', ""The thought is that MVNOs can reach additional customers that the wireless providers would n't have been able to acquire by themselves . They do this by targeting specific groups of customers ( those who want pre - paid or no - contract plans ) , offering different phones and devices , and generally differentiating them in some way from the wireless provider . There 's definitely some cannibalism that goes on , but the hope is that the MVNOs bring in a net gain to the wireless provider .""]",0,real,0.0061627887,0,True

Old operating systems served the food buffet style . ALL the food was put out and people just came in and had all they wanted . Naturally , people ( programs ) who came in later had less food to choose from . So we upgrade the operating system to include some multi - tasking rules . And we teach people ( programs ) how to form a line , take only one plate of food at a time , and this makes things more fair and manageable . This works so well that soon we had rules ( like "" please "" and "" thank you "" and asking people to "" pass "" things ) that enabled everyone to SIT at the table and enjoy a nice dinner together . It was great -- as long as everyone knew the rules . But kids do n\'t know the rules . And often , kids ca n\'t understand the rules if you explain them . So the kids keep running into the room and grabbing whatever they want from the table , being greedy , eating from other people \'s plates , causing a mess and creating chaos . So we create a "" kids table . "" ( VMWare ) This is a completely separate table where the children can sit and food is brought to them ( they ca n\'t get their own ) .

Docker images are a collection of layers , so you might have an Ubuntu layer , then a Ruby layer , then a layer that includes your webapp . This can all be constructed in a Dockerfile that puts the pieces together . This results in an image which can be used to run containers just about anywhere : your laptop , a server in a datacenter , or on an instance in a public cloud .

Moving Docker images around is more of an ecosystem enhancement than a core technology , but it 's a nice feature . Docker includes the [ push ] ( URL_2 ) and [ pull ] ( URL_5 ) commands that make it very easy to manage images in a central registry .

All you need to know is that the shares you own in the fund as a whole are accruing value over time through the wise buying and selling of securities on the part of the fund manager , the person responsible for managing the fund \'s portfolio and increasing its value over time . Of course , the basic rule of buying and selling assets applies to mutual funds as well : You are not guaranteed to make money . In fact , you are n\'t even guaranteed to * keep * the money you start out with . It \'s possible for mutual funds to lose value over time , meaning if you put $ 10,000 into one right now , a year from now your share of the fund might only be worth $ 9,000 . So why would you put money into a mutual fund rather than just putting it into an interest - bearing deposit account , or buying bonds with it ? Because an interest - bearing deposit account or bond investment might , over a year , turn your $ 10,000 into $ 10,300 if you get a good rate â¦ while a mutual fund * has a chance * of turning your $ 10,000 into $ 12,000 in the same time . There \'s a chance for bigger returns , balanced by a chance that you might lose value over time . ( This is pretty rare , though . Most mutual funds are well - managed , and give you returns that are * at least * somewhat better than what you could get from risk - free investing over the same period of time . ) Now the question becomes , how do you go about buying shares in a mutual fund ? Well , the most obvious way is just to walk into the office of some mutual fund someplace and write them a check . But when you do this , you need to know two things . First , the money you use to buy the shares of that fund has * already been taxed . * If you earned $ 30,000 last year and paid $ 10,000 of it in taxes , the $ 20,000 you have left is all you have to buy shares of the fund with . The other thing to know is that in the future , when you cash out of the mutual fund , * you \'re going to be taxed again * on the * profits * you made from your investment . The rate at which those profits are taxed depends on how long you stayed in the fund and how much you made when you got out , but the point is the government is going to take a cut . The way around this is to structure your investment as a Roth IRA . IRA stands for "" individual retirement account "" , and a Roth IRA is a type of IRA ( named for the guy in the Senate who sponsored the law that created it ) . The virtue of structuring your investment as a Roth IRA is that if you follow certain rules , you can get * out * of having to pay taxes on the profit the investment pays you . These rules are pretty complicated , and involve contribution limits â a limit to how much you can put into your investment every year â and seasoning times â how long you have to leave the money in the investment before you can take it out . But as long as you work within those rules , a Roth IRA backed by a well - managed mutual fund can be a really good way to store your money , protect its value against inflation ( by getting a return on your investment that \'s equal to the rate of inflation ) , and make a decent profit for your trouble .', 'Think of a ROTH IRA as just wrapping paper .

You owe me _ _ _ _ "" But he never seems to notice that this ROTH package gets bigger and bigger . In other words , whatever you decide to cover in your ROTH wrapping paper will grow without ever affecting your tax output . However , it does n\'t help you pay any less taxes on the money you decide to put into it . ( from your paycheck , for example . ) You still have to pay your regular taxes on money * before * it gets put in the ROTH wrapper . SOOO .....

Only very , very few numbers stop .', ""Typing on my phone , so sorry if this is too unclear . > Why does it go on forever when virtually no other number does ? Actually , by a quite reasonable definition , * most * numbers have decimal expansions that go on forever without repeating . If you take out from the real numbers the integers ( positive and negative whole numbers ) and rational numbers ( numbers that can be written as a ratio of two integers , all of which have finite decimal expansions or expansions that have the same pattern repeated * ad infinitum * ) , you 're left with numbers that , like pi , have decimal expansions that continue infinitely without repeating , which we call the irrational numbers because they can not be written as a ratio of whole numbers . It turns out that there is no way to make a one - to - one mapping of these irrational numbers back to the rational numbers -- one set fits nicely inside the other , but you ca n't fit the other back into the one , even though both are infinite . Xelopheris writes : > Pi is what is known as an irrational number , in that it can not be expressed as an algebraic equation . Actually , there are plenty of irrational numbers that are solutions to algebraic equations , sqrt(2 ) being one of them -- both sqrt(2 ) and -sqrt(2 ) are solutions to the equation x ^ 2 = 2 . You probably wanted to write that pi is a * transcendental * number .

The ones left over are called the transcendental numbers , and pi is one of these . > And how do we know ? Well , this one is complicated . It started with an old problem in constructive geometry ( which means basically drawing figures with a straightedge and compass , using only inherent mathematical relationships in your drawing and not measuring as in , say , with a ruler ) . The problem was whether or not , given a circle , you could construct a square with the same circumference . You could think of this as starting with a rational number ( the length of a line ) and using basic operations ( constructing new lines and circles ) and getting to pi ( another line whose length was the circumference of the circle whose diameter was the line you started with ) . It was n't until the 19th century , when we had a lot more math than we did when the problem was posed , that we were able to prove that it could n't be done . I know I really have n't answered your last question , but if someone could explain the Lindemann - Weierstrass theorem in plain English ( because I ca n't ) , that would be the answer you are looking for . > And why is it random ? Simply put , we do n't know that it is . All we know is that it goes on forever and does not repeat . Strictly speaking , it is n't random at all , the digits of pi are a fixed , calculable set of numbers . But you might guess that the digits are pseudorandom and uniform -- namely that any given decimal place is equally likely to be any one of the digits from 0 to 9 . When we look at finite sections of the digits , it appears that the longer the section , the closer each of the digits get to showing up the same number of times . As yet , though , nobody has been able to prove that this will be the case no matter how far out we look . EDIT : typo and added the answer to the last question"", ""1/3 does the same thing except the random part . Obviously though PI is more than just a simple fraction . There are a variety of methods of calculating pi , but all of them kind of rest on an infinite repeating pattern that can always be added on to for more precision . For example , since we know pi to be a ratio between the circumference and the radius or diameter , all we really need for a given circle is to get the most precise measurement of it 's circumference and we can calculate pi from an easily measured radius . The problem is how to measure the circumference precisely . So for one method , imagine dividing a circle into slices , like a pizza . We can use the assumption that the ends ( the crust ) is flat so they make triangles to calculate perimeter by using simple trig to get all the lengths of the slices ' crusts and adding them up . With four slices to start , it 'd look horrible and be pretty inaccurate , we 'd calculate the perimeter of a square basically . But then we up the ante and maybe do 8 slices . The perimeter is of an octagon but much closer to the circle now . As you may start to see , this can go on infinitely and theoretically , it will never perfectly match up to the circumference of a circle . It 's a method such as this ( not exactly , but in a similar infinite series way ) that is used to calculate pi , and hence why no matter how many decimals we calculate to , we can always calculate more .""]",0,real,0.0060355957,0,True

How do video game cheat code devices ( Action Replay / Gameshark ) work ? What exactly does the device do to create a cheat code environment ? Please explain like I'm five.,"[""Games ( and any software ) will load elements that it needs to use into the device 's memory . These cheat devices find where that piece of code lives in memory and modifies it . So basically it looks in memory for where your number of lives are stored and changes it to whatever you tell it to . In the case of setting something to unlimited the cheat device prevents the game from changing what is stored in memory ."", 'The most basic type of code you would program into the device is a RAM Overwrite code . The simplest example of this would be an infinite money cheat . The developers working for AR or Gameshark load up the game on whatever developer hardware they have and play for a bit . Eventually , they would take a note of how much money the game says they have , and also take a snapshot of the contents of RAM . Then they could go buy some stuff and take another snapshot . At this point , they could do a search through the RAM snapshot for the value of money that the game showed when it was taken ( say $ 1000 ) . This would give them all the RAM locations containing the value 1000 . Doing the same for the second snapshot , they would get all the locations containing 800 ( for example ) . A simple cross - reference should yield the locations in RAM that contain a reference to the value of money the player currently has . If there \'s a lot of results , more snapshots would help narrow it down . If there are still multiple results after several snapshots are correlated , it probably means that the value for money is stored in multiple locations . This could be because one is a "" saved "" value and one is a "" working "" value , or , the value is copied at some point for computation , but not overwritten with something else when the computation is done , or the game has some sort of error checking system where all the values must match . At this point , the cheat developer would start playing around with what happens when the values are manually changed . Once they figure out which RAM locations actually control the value of money , they take those locations , along with some value ( say 9999 for example ) , and make a RAM Overwrite code . When you program this code into your cheat device , it instructs the device to periodically ( many , many times per second ) overwrite whatever value is in those RAM locations with 9999 . So , when the player goes to buy something , the new value of money is calculated for the purchase , but shortly afterwards , the cheat device rewrites the value as if it never happened . The code itself that you program into the cheat device just contains some value indicating the type of code ( RAM Overwrite in our above example ) the RAM address to overwrite and the value to write with . Also , most companies will take the code and encrypt it so that only the cheat device can decrypt it and figure out what the code is supposed to do . This just protects the work they put into developing the cheat . Another important type of code is the Enable code , and is a bit tougher . With most cheat devices , you have to have an enable code to use any other cheats for the game . This ties into our above example where we talked about RAM locations being overwritten many times per second . Doing this is actually not that simple . The cheat device does n\'t have access to RAM at all , not while the game is running . The only thing it can do is , when a request is made to get read - only data from the cartridge ( code to be executed , graphical data , audio data , etc . ) the cheat device can intercept it and send something else instead . To get access to RAM , the cheat device needs a hook , a mechanism by which it can begin inserting its own executable code into the game code . To do this , the cheat developer needs to find some spot in the game code to insert the hook , which will probably involve replacing some game instruction ( or several ) with another instruction ( or several ) that will attempt to access the cartridge in some way that the cheat device will recognize . This can only be done with expertise , as finding a good hook point involves finding some game code that is run very frequently , that can be modified without breaking the game , and that can handle being halted for significant periods of time ( while the cheat device runs its code ) without affecting the performance or responsiveness of the game . For example , the cheat developer could use a section of code that checks the status of the controller buttons , to see if any have been pressed , which pretty much every game needs . This gets run very often , but messing with it could affect the game \'s responsiveness to button presses , and the player might feel that the game is laggy . The Enable code itself will contain the following . ( A ) Information for the hook instruction(s ) such that during any normal cartridge read , if the hook instruction is part of the read , the cheat device will automatically swap the game \'s instruction out for the hook instruction and send it instead . ( B ) Optionally , as this may not need to be different from game - to - game , information about what "" special operation "" the hook instruction will perform , which signals to the cheat device that it needs to start sending its own executable code to be run . ( C ) Optionally , information about where the cheat device \'s code will be loaded into RAM . Running from RAM as opposed to ROM is much , much faster , and less likely to cause "" lag "" issues as described above , but requires that there be enough space in RAM to load all the code , without affecting the game . ( D ) Optionally , information about the instructions that the hook replaced , which may still need to be executed in some way . Again , this is still a pretty basic picture of the kinds of things cheat devices do . All of the above assumes , for example , that the game does n\'t contain any type of anti - cheat measures . The Pokemon series is probably the most famous for anti - cheat . Individual Pokemon that you \'ve caught are made up of 100 - byte blocks of memory ( in Gen 3 , more bytes are used in later Gens ) most of which are encrypted and checksummed . Additionally , the actual locations of the blocks in the cartridge flash memory varies , and the entire contents of flash memory are checksummed , preventing any changes from being made without also changing the checksum value . The encryptions and checksums are not that complicated and are actually pretty well documented and easy to fake for developers and people with special hardware , or emulators , but doing so from a cheat device that has to rely on hooks and limited access to RAM is pretty damn difficult .', 'In addition to /u / wcrb15 \'s answer , I \'d also add that just like modern PC games have built - in functions meant for the use of devs during the game \'s creation and testing , older games often had these as well .

How does Yahoo finance adjust stock data for splits and dividends?,"['Yahoo\'s ""Adj Close"" data is adjusted for splits, but not for dividends. Despite Yahoo\'s webpage\'s footnote saying  *Close price adjusted for dividends and splits. we can see empirically that the ""Adj Close"" is only adjusted for splits. For example, consider Siemens from Jan 27, 2017 to Mar 15, 2017: The Adj Close adjusts for splits: On any particular day, the ""Adj Close"" is equal to the ""Close"" price divided by the cumulative product of all splits that occurred after that day. If there have been no splits after that day, then the ""Adj Close"" equals the ""Close"" price. Since there is a 2-for-1 split on Mar 14, 2017, the Adj Close is half the Close price for all dates from Jan 27, 2017 to Mar 13, 2017. Note that if Siemens were to split again at some time in the future, the Adj Close prices will be readjusted for this future split. For example, if Siemens were to split 3-for-1 tomorrow, then all the Adj Close prices seen above will be divided by 3. The Adj Close is thus showing the price that a share would have traded on that day if the shares had already been split in accordance with all splits up to today. The Adj Close does not adjust for dividends: Notice that Siemens distributed a $1.87 dividend on Feb 02, 2017 and ~$3.74 dividend on Jan 30, 2017. If the Adj Close value were adjusted for these dividends then we should expect the Adj Close should no longer be exactly half of the Close amount. But we can see that there is no such adjustment -- the Adj Close remains (up to rounding) exactly half the Close amount: Note that in theory, the market reacts to the distribution of dividends by reducing the trading price of shares post-dividend. This in turn is reflected in the raw closing price. So in that sense the Adj Close is also automatically adjusted for dividends. But there is no formula for this. The effect is already baked in through the market\'s closing prices.']",0,real,0.94997305,1,False

How do life insurance companies make a profit ? I 'm guessing they invest the money from payments or something but I 'm not sure . I 've got a feeling that it 's going to be an embarrassingly obvious answer . :/ Please explain like I'm five.,"[""Insurance professional here . There are a few ways that , combined , explain how an insurance company makes money . 1 . Underwriting , which consists of choosing who to insure , what the policy will look like ( i.e. any endorsements or exclusions , ) and what premium to charge . Companies with better overall underwriting will have a lower percentage of losses relative to the premium they collect . This means their rates need to be competitive enough to attract customers but not so so aggressive that they do not support the anticipated losses . Insurance companies employ actuaries to assist in setting their rates , which are regulated by the states . 2 . Operational efficiency . Think of a manufacturer - they can increase profits either by increasing their prices or by using lower cost materials . Insurance companies use a number of strategies to make operations more efficient . There are a lot of strategies in this area . The current trend is implementing new software to handle various parts of the process . This is their version of using lower cost materials . 3 . Investments . There is often a span of time between when the policy is purchased and when a claim is made . During this period , insurance companies will invest some of the premium they collect . To clarify though , the statement about investing for a 60 % return is completely wrong . Insurance companies are highly regulated in a number of ways , including the types of investments they can make . The idea is that insurance companies offer financial stability in return for a premium , so if they invest recklessly , lose the money , and are unable to pay claims , then the stability is lost and this is bad for society in general . Overall , about 2/3 ( 66.8 % ) of the investable assets of an average life insurance company are held in cash and bonds . Different kinds of insurers will choose different types of bonds based on their expectations of claims and , without going into too much detail on that , life insurance companies tend to purchase long term ( up to 30 year ) bonds . The three major bond types - treasuries , municipals , and corporate - currently pay an average of 3.44 % , 3.97 % , and 4.49 % , respectively . More info on insurance company investments available at : URL_0 Very plainly , insurance companies have about four percentage points to play with . If we consider that to be a given , then their paid claims and operating expenses can not exceed 96 % of the premiums they charged or they 'll be losing money . Because they can not influence the return on their largest area of investment , there is a serious emphasis put on underwriting and operational efficiency . As for whether or not non - compulsory insurance makes sense , that 's going to vary from person to person . I 'm unmarried with no kids - nobody relies on me for food or shelter . Because of this , the only life insurance I have is what 's provided to me through my employer . If we changed the scenario and I was married with kids and a mortgage , then I 'd likely purchase the life insurance to minimize their financial discomfort in the event I died ."", 'In addition to what ACrusaderA said , keep in mind that a policy holder needs to pay repeatedly and on time to keep their benefits . It is not terribly uncommon for people to forget or to fall on hard times and be unable to pay their premium , in which case all the premiums they paid thus far will not be mitigated by the insurance company paying out later .', ""They invest a lot of money that you give them . Instead of investing $ 100 for 0.01 % return , they invest $ 10 million and get 60 % return .

How do share buybacks work?,"['The short version of JB King\'s excellent answer is that the company will typically buy back shares from the open market at market price. Sometimes, it will specifically target larger stakeholders, even controlling interests, who are making noise that they want to divest; if such an investor were to just dump their stock on the open market, neither the investor nor the company would be very happy with the resulting price collapse. In those cases, the company may offer an incentive price above market rates. In recent times, the investor looking to divest has often been the U.S. Government, who received stock in return for bailouts, and (with notable exceptions) turned a modest profit on many of them. Not enough to break even on the entire bailout, but the Government didn\'t just throw $700 billion in taxpayer money down a hole as conservative pundits would have you believe.

Explain like I'm five.","['FAA licensed flight instructor here ! I get excited when an ELI5 is in my wheel house . The short answer is ... practice . In calm winds , lining up with the runway \'s dashed centerline is actually one of the least challenging parts of a landing . It \'s basically not too much harder that tracking your car down the middle of the lane . Student pilots ( and experienced pilots ) tend to have much more trouble maintaining a safe and stable speed and "" glidepath "" down to the runway . Where things get tricky is when you have a crosswind . Pilots will line up with the runway in a "" crab angle . "" In this case , the nose of the plane is pointed slightly into the wind and the aircraft track slightly sideways towards the runway . It \'s like a boat going across a river . In order to go directly across , you have to point the bow slightly into the current so you do n\'t drift downstream . You do n\'t want to land sideways , so just before touchdown the pilot will point the nose straight down the runway with the rudder and then bank the wings slightly into the wind . This is called a "" sideslip "" and it ensure the plane will be pointed straight down the runway while the bank angle of the wings prevents the plane from drifting downwind . The upwind wheel will often touch before the downwind wheel . Here \'s more info .... URL_1 Most of the time pilots are landing using visual references out the cockpit window and flying by hand , even passenger jets at major airports . This is called a visual approach . It sounds kinda crude , but air traffic controllers at big airports prefer them because they can usually get more planes lined up for a runway at once , thereby increasing an airport \'s capacity . But what if you ca n\'t see the runway ? Most runways at big airports are equipped with an Instrument Landing System ( ILS ) . Basically , the pilot follows a radio signal through the clouds / fog / rain / snow down to the runway . The goal is to break out of the clouds or get close enough to the runway that you can see it and land on it . A basic ILS approach will get you down to 200 ft and 1/2mi from the runway before you have to go around and land somewhere else . Some airports are equipped with CATIII ILS approaches where you can land at almost zero visibility . URL_0 These days , GPS based approaches are becoming increasingly popular because you can create curved approach paths and the airport does n\'t have to invest in a ground - based radio signal system . As for autopilot ... it \'s very rarely used all the way down to the ground . Normally the pilots will turn it off when they drop the landing gear and fly by hand . Sometimes they might use the autopilot to intercept an ILS but then turn it off once the runway is in sight . Fully automated landings are only done in very low visibility . They require so much extra button pushing to set up that it \'s usually easier to hand fly the plane when conditions permit . * I should note that while I \'m a flight instructor , I \'m not an airline pilot and have n\'t flown any big jets .

Rather , they instead dispute the circumstances and details of this incredibly politicized historical event and come to a different interpretation . From what I understand , Holocaust revisionists generally deny that the Nazi Concentration camps were designed to systematically exterminate people , and claim the "" death camps "" were actually initially designed as political internment camps , similar to [ camps in the USA for Japanese citizens in WW2 ] ( URL_0 ) . They often mention the Auschwitz swimming pool , Orchestra , theater , sports - field and art activities and ask why they were built for , and used by people who the Nazi \'s intended to simply exterminate .

Revisionists also point to the design of the camps , using the blueprints as being clearly ( in their opinion ) , inefficient for mass murder . They claim that the "" gas chambers "" were used for delousing clothing and bedding and go into great detail on that subject . They also explain away much of the holocaust evidence as having been faked after the fact , [ for example this fake photo ] ( URL_2 ) , which has been in newspapers , magazines , documentaries , and even hit front - page on Reddit several times . ( I did some research , in this specific case it turns out the photo really was faked and even mainstream historians admit it . ) When asked to explain why so many died in the camps , they often talk about the mass bombing of farms , railways and roads by allied forces nearing the end of the war - meaning that almost no supplies reached the German people , let alone the camps - resulting in many camp inhabitants dying of starvation and disease .

How do speakers virtually produce any sound ? From my understanding speakers are made up of some vibrating cone of a fixed shape . It just seems to me that such a thing could only produce one sound like a drum . Explain like I'm five.,"['It \'s the * way in which it vibrates * that counts . Different sounds are made from different pitches and amplitudes . Pitch is determined by how fast the speaker vibrates , and amplitude is determined by how "" hard "" it vibrates . When your computer pumps music to your speakers , it is really pumping a voltage waveform . This waveform represents the sound of the music ( it \'s what the music looks like on the computer , with the wavy lines ) . The waveform represents different sounds with changes in frequency ( pitch ) and amplitude ( loudness ) . Now , inside the speaker is the cone , a solenoid ( solenoids turn into magnets when current runs through them ) and a permanent magnet . When a voltage is applied to the solenoid , it becomes a magnet , the solenoid and permanent magnet move each other , and the cone ( attached to the solenoid ) moves . In fact , if you wanted , the computer could send a signal to the speaker that would make it move the cone once , then hold this position . Whatever voltage waveform is pumped to the speaker , the speaker will move accordingly . So , for example , if the voltage waveform is a perfect sine wave , the speaker cone will move like a sign wave . Incidentally , this movement will cause the air surrounding the cone to move in a sine wave and produce a single pitch . In the whole process , the music waveform is converted to a voltage waveform , which electromagnetically moves the cone in the same waveform , reproducing the sound . So , by changing the frequency of the voltage waveform , you change how fast the speaker vibrates and change the pitch ( i.e the sound ) made by the speaker .', 'Your * [ eardrum ] ( URL_0 ) * is a thin membrane that translates the sound emanating from * any * source into the audible sensations you hear .

Your job will mail you your tax information , called W-2 forms . 2 . Figure out your total tax liability ( how much you owe the government ) 2 . Figure out how much tax credit you get ( how much the government owes you ) 3 . Subtract the credit from the liability to find out how much tax you should actually be paying . 4 . Compare the tax you actually owe to the estimated tax that was withheld in Step 2 . 5 . Figure out whether you underpaid or overpaid over the course of the year . If you underpaid , you owe the government more money . If you overpaid , you get a refund . 6 . Repeat for both state and local . Protip : [ Just use software to do it for you . ] ( URL_0 ) It \'ll ask you stuff like , "" Are you married ? "" or "" Did you buy a house this year ? "" or "" What does your W-2 say in box 3 ? "" and you just fill in the answers and hit "" submit . ""', 'I \'m going to assume you mean taxes as in income tax / the frenzy people get into about "" tax day "" ( normally on / around April 15th ) and "" tax return / refund "" that you hear people talking about . So here \'s the deal , baring some exceptions , every dollar you earn at a job is taxed . When you started working you might have been asked to fill out several forms , one of which might have asked you things like "" how many dependents do you have . "" Then it gives you a very rough ( and usually very bad , more on this later ) estimate of how much federal income tax you \'ll owe for the working year . So let \'s say it says "" we estimate you should withhold 15 % of your wages for taxes "" and you say fine . Now , your paycheck is 15 % less , but the important thing is you have n\'t lost any money . That 15 % that they take -- it \'s still there , it \'s still yours , you just do n\'t have it * now * . ( In a real paycheck there would be other deductions taken off too : social security , local taxes , etc . ) Now around February - April , most people will * * file * * their federal taxes . This is nothing more than filling out a few pages of documentation to let the government know how much money you earned , so they can figure out how much money you need to pay . So you \'ll typically get some forms from your job around this time called the W2 that lists how much money you \'ve earned , how much you \'ve paid in taxes , and how much you \'ve withheld for taxes . Let \'s say that the gross salary is 50k over the course of the year . Gross means absolute total , before any taxes etc were taken out . This is the theoretical amount you \'d have earned if you did n\'t pay taxes , pay social security , etc . The US federal income tax system is one called a "" progressive tax "" system . Another tax system you might have heard in the news is called a "" flat tax "" system , which is also known as a "" regressive tax "" system . The flat / regressive tax system is simple to understand : you pay the same percentage of taxes no matter your income . So if the flat tax was say 10 % , then your 50k income means you pay $ 5000 , and someone \'s 500k income means they would theoretically pay 50k . This is n\'t actually a good thing because imagine a person earning 20k / year gross : for him paying $ 2000 in taxes is a huge amount of money leaving him with less to spend for necessities . For that rich guy making 200k , he \'d pay 20k , which is the entire income of the poor guy , but he still has 180k left to spend on things like "" food "" and "" housing . "" Sales tax is a form of a regressive tax because poor people pay the same in taxes for that chicken that needs to feed his family for the entire week , whereas for a rich person the measly dollar or two in sales tax for the chicken is literally pocket change . Back to the income tax / progressive tax . The system is split into several brackets . I do n\'t recall them off the top of my head , but let \'s say the following are the brackets : * From $ 0 to $ 30000 you pay 0 % taxes * From $ 30001 to $ 50000 you pay 20 % taxes * From $ 50001 to $ 100k you pay 30 % taxes * Etc So back to your 50k gross income : this means that the money you earn up to 30k will * * always * * be taxed at 0 % . It does n\'t matter if you make 50k , 25k , 500k . The first 30k will always be 0 % . The money you earned between 30k and 50k are now taxed at 20 % , always and forever . So you do some math : you have $ 20000 left untaxed , and on that 20k ( and * * only * * on that 20k ) you will pay 20 % on taxes . The total amount you owe is just added up from all the brackets . This is important to understand because every now and then you \'ll hear conservative talking points like "" I was given a raise which pushed me into the next tax bracket and now I take home less money because I pay more in taxes ! "" which is 100 % factually incorrect . Even if you were "" pushed into the next tax bracket "" , the only additional taxes you would pay is the amount in only that next tax bracket , so unless that next tax bracket had a tax percent over 100 % then it is impossible to pay so much more in taxes that you take home less money , due to income tax . Now when you do your taxes you might also hear people talking about "" deductions "" . What are these ? These are ways to make your income look "" less "" so that you pay less taxes overall . Remember that your gross income was 50k . If you support yourself ( ie , your parents do n\'t claim to support you ) then you are allowed to take a personal deduction . Let \'s say this deduction is worth $ 5000 . You subtract it from your gross income to get your "" adjusted taxable wage "" , which would be 45k in this example . This would now lower your tax burden : the first 30k is still taxed at 0 % , but now you only need to pay 20 % on 15k for the next bracket , instead of 20 % on the original 20k . There are quite a few ways to lower your tax burden . Donating to charity for example would lower it . I think you get a tax credit if you bought an electric car , so that lowers your taxable wage as well . I think first time home buyers get a credit as well . If you deposit money directly from your salary into a retirement plan ( IRA , 401k , etc ) then it lowers your taxable wages as well . Ok , so you now have figured out how much money you owe the federal government in income taxes . How do you pay it ? Well actually , you \'ve already essentially been paying it . Remember that federal withholding we talked about ? That \'s money that has been set aside ( withheld ) from your paycheck to be used to pay federal income taxes . So after one year of working , let \'s say they have withheld a total amount of 10k from your wages , and now you figure out you only need to pay 5k in taxes . You fill out your forms and give the IRS a bank account for them to deposit the remaining 5k into . A couple weeks later you get a huge 5k "" bonus "" and you \'re happy and go out and buy a brand new car with this "" free money . "" Only that \'s not free money . That \'s money that you actually earned . That \'s money that you told the government to withhold for you to pay taxes with , but that extra amount you get back means that he government has withheld too much money and are just giving it back to you . This money was just sitting there this entire time , earning no interest for you , not letting you access it to buy things , etc . The best way is to actually sit down and do the math to figure out how much you \'ll need to pay , and tell them to withhold as close to that amount as possible , but this is a much harder subject to talk about .']",0,real,0.0064835935,0,True

If you see from your list that the same pattern of cards ALWAYS repeats then that is a sign that the shuffle is not truly random .

"How do people decipher ancient writing systems ? For example , how did people decipher the Sumerian number system ?

Things got translated over and over again to newer languages . A lot of Ancient Greek texts actually came to us through the Arabic translation movement .

"How do college campuses have the same WiFi network across entire campuses ? How do all the routers connect to the same network ? Also in some places on campus my internet works way better than others , so does each router have its own bandwidth ? Explain like I'm five.","[""It 's called a [ wifi mesh ] ( URL_0 ) . There are multiple ways to set up a wifi mesh . From having one wifi access point connect over wifi to a neighbor , to having all access points connect to a central switch over Ethernet . As for why some on - campus locations appear ( or are ) to be faster or slower than others , that 's something you 'd have to ask your campus network staff ."", ""Large - scale WiFi deployments tend to work quite differently to simple home or small business networks . There are so many Access Points ( APs ) that they wo n't fit on a single Ethernet network , they interfere with each other , and users are constantly being passed from one AP to another , sometimes on different networks , as they move around . Also , you ca n't just have a single password and tell everyone , so you need to implement enterprise - scale authentication allowing users to connect using their username and password . Without going into too many details , enterprise WiFi typically has a central controller box ( or boxes for redundancy ) . The APs are really dumb radios that send and receive all their packets to and from the central controller to be dealt with . The WiFi packets are sent via a TCP / IP protocol so the APs can all be on different Ethernet segments themselves , even though the WiFi environment they present to the users looks like a single network . The central server device is configured to have access to the corporate authentication service ( e.g. , via Radius ) so it can use the same username / password authentication as other IT services on campus . The problem with bandwidth tends to be on the WiFi side rather than the Ethernet network side . Campuses tend to have hundreds of WiFi users , some with multiple devices . In a small space all these devices will be talking with just a few APs with only a small number of non - overlapping WiFi channels available . At 2.4GHz , for example , there are 11 channels ( varies by country ) but you have to space by 5 channels to avoid overlap , so using only channels 1 , 6 , and 11 is common . There are more channels ( 8 ? ) at 5GHz but still not that many . In common areas they will pack in many APs and turn down their WiFi power to try to limit how much they interfere with each other , but this is really a work - around . Also , devices using old WiFi standards tend to slow down the network for everyone . So there 's no point stealing enterprise APs ; they 're totally useless devices without tons of expensive hardware to make them work , hardware that requires expertise to configure and run ."", ""The network is deployed out in segments . Think of it like this - each floor of each building gets its own network , and then the buildings have routers that connect all of those networks together , and then those routers connect to the campus ' data center where there are bigger routers that handle connecting not only the buildings to each other but the entire campus to the Internet at large . As far as the WiFi goes - when you 're deploying a campus - wide network , there will be centralized management of the access points in order to handle things like channel assignments and client management . Every access point is given the same name and to a user looks like seamless coverage , but there will be dozens if not hundreds or thousands of access points blanketing the campus with the same SSID . However , those access points are all going to be working on different channels so as to not overlap signals with each other ( either in the general 1 - 6 - 11 configuration to eliminate channel overlap or in a 1 - 4 - 8 - 11 configuration to simply minimize it ) . As well , the central management of the access points will work to try and prevent a single access point from getting overloaded . Throw 200 people into a lecture hall with one access point and the amount of effective bandwidth for users is going to be quite minimal . But if you have ten access points in and around the lecture hall , the server can force clients to disconnect from one access point and reconnect to another access point with a decent signal strength so that you have people on the edges of the hall connecting to access points in other rooms so that each access point gets 20 users competing for the bandwidth instead of 200 . Access points can be connected in two ways - wired or mesh . If an access point is wired , as most access points in a campus - level network should be , it will have its own dedicated bandwidth that it can serve of either 100 Mbps or 1 Gbps . If the access point is connected in a mesh configuration , bandwidth management becomes more complex because the access point needs to use its radios for both serving clients and getting their traffic upstream . Why does it work better in some places rather than others ? There are a lot of reasons for that . It could be that other users are causing bandwidth congestion - a couple of people connected to the same access point are watching Netflix , so you go to download a file and find that the pool of bandwidth you 're sharing is mostly going to serve them instead of you because their usage is more constant than yours . It could be that there are too many users connected to the access point - wireless bandwidth is a shared pool among the users , so the more users there are the more contention there is to try and use the same bandwidth and the more overhead increases trying to separate everyone 's traffic . And it could be that you 're getting a bad signal - your radio might indicate that you 're getting a good signal power , but the wall between you and the access point might be scattering that signal to hell and back in a way that causes both your device and the access point to have to constantly resend data to ensure it 's being received properly .""]",0,real,0.006440934,0,True
"How do people learn a language just by talking to people who are fluent ? If you do n't understand what is being said to begin with , how do you eventually start understanding ? Please explain like I'm five.","['Think of how kids learn what will be their native language . They do nt pop out understanding even the concept of words , they just live amongst people speaking the language and pick up on the fact that certain mouth sounds represent certain things . Gradually through context and repetition they build up enough of a collection of sounds with enough understanding of meaning to converse . Same thing with learning a new language later . I may have no idea what "" cerveza "" means , but if I hear a spanish speaker say it and then receive a beer I can have a pretty good idea .', 'One big piece of language learning is tied to our conceptual vocabulary . Conceptual vocabulary is our ability to apply meaning and context to an item , an action , an emotion , etc . in the world around us . For example , I could hold up a banana and depending on your knowledge and exposure to that banana or the banana industry or facts about banana , you \'d know that green bananas do n\'t normally taste that great , that most bananas we see are yellow and if a banana is black or mushy to the touch it \'s probably bad . Assuming your conceptual vocabulary veers towards normal , you \'d know you ca n\'t write with a banana and you ca n\'t drive a banana . This is based on an entire lifetime of seeing bananas , eating bananas and just in general , your brain \'s natural association with an abstract sound connecting to a piece of our reality that associates meaning back to our brain . When we learn language as a child , our brains are connecting the dots between the language around us and the world around us . That \'s why it \'s so important to expose kids to a variety of different experiences , as well as explaining those experiences and things to the child . Babies and kids need to hear and interact with language while growing up because it activates their brain for more language . The usual rule is that kids really need to be exposed to vast amounts of language and experiences by age 5 because our brains are hardwired to use those first five years to really absorb all those really complicated parts of a language , such as grammar and cultural factors and social cues . Research has been done on young children about their understanding of grammar and it \'s amazing how they understand really complicated abstract grammar simply based on them knowing what "" sounds "" right and what "" sounds "" wrong . That \'s based on exposure , parents and adults teaching them how to use it , correcting them when they use it wrong . If you want to read up more about this need for constant stimulus required for language development , you can look into the story of Genie . She was a kid who was locked in a crib since birth and who was basically neglected and alone until she was discovered at 13 . Even after she was rescued , she never developed language skills because she was so deprived for so long at so young that her brain never trigger first language . Her language skills improved while some researchers were working with her , but once the researched stopped and she was put in a home for the mentally ill , her skills rapidly regressed because she just was n\'t being exposed to language anymore . If you \'re talking about how we can move to a different country and slowly grow to learn the language , it \'s about how we \'re connecting the dots of the new language around us with our existing knowledge of conceptual vocabulary as well as our understanding of our first language . It \'s similar to how we learn language as a child , but since we already have our first language , learning a second language is more based on connecting the world , our existing language and our conceptual language together . That \'s why learning nouns and verbs are always easier when learning a second language , while grammar is probably a bit more difficult when it \'s not related to our first language . That \'s why we point and gesture and try to mine actions if we \'re in a country where we do n\'t speak the language . I can hold up a banana and I call it a banana while a person who only speaks Tagalog knows it as saging , but we both understand the banana , when green it \'s underripe , yellow is good , mushy or black spots is bad , etc . etc .

The biggest obstacle on why a lot of people "" ca n\'t "" learn a second language is mostly psychological and contextual rather than sheer ability .

We also have to immerse and surround the learner with an environment just filled with fluent speakers . When someone moves to another country , if they completely immerse themselves , meaning no exposure to their first language , then they will pick up the language so much faster compared to someone who frequents ex - pat areas or still uses their first language to write and read . Conversing with fluent speakers helps us test our language ability and for us to read and note when we say things right and when we say things wrong . We self - adjust and that just accumulates to the point where if we correct often enough , we \'ll get to a point where we do n\'t make many mistakes anymore .

How do planes / subs know when missiles have a ' lock ' ? Or have I been watching too many movies Please explain like I'm five.,"['Missile systems generally consists of a radar to detect where the target is and send commands to the missile to tell it where to go . The radars have several modes which have their different use cases and a target can detect the signals from the radar to see what mode it is in . A radar might start out using low frequency and large sweeping scans to detect the rough placement of all planes in the sky . However this does not give accurate enough and frequent enough updates to be able to hit anything . So they change to a higher frequency radar with a more narrow sweep . This means they can only detect the airplane in the direction they aim the radar but they will be more accurate . This change of mode can be detected in the target airplane but still have to be interpreted correctly . A lot of radars had different modes of operation in peace and war so that the enemy would not be able to analyze their signals before the war .', 'I always use the flashlight analogy . Two planes trying to find each other in the sky with radar is like you and your buddy playing flashlight tag at night in pitch dark . Each plane \'s radar is normally in a "" search "" mode , where it just sweeps back and forth , searching a huge swath of sky in front of the aircraft . This is just like you , sweeping your flashlight back and forth in front of you , scanning in the dark for your friend . When your flashlight \'s beam passes over him , you can see him for a split second , before your flashlight sweeps past him and continues on . You keep sweeping your flashlight back and forth , so every few seconds , when your flashlight beam passes back over your buddy , you get another "" update "" on where he is . Now lets say you want to start chasing your friend so you can tag him ( in the context of a plane , you \'re launching a missile ) . You ca n\'t chase your friend very well when you can only see him once every few seconds as your flashlight passes over him . So you point your flashlight directly at your friend and track him with it . From your friend \'s point of view , every few seconds , he sees a flash of light from your flashlight as the beam passes over him . He knows you \'re searching for him , but he has no way of knowing if you have seen him yet . Then , your intermittent flashes of light change to a constant beam , as your turn your flashlight and point it right at him . Now , he knows you \'ve seen him , he knows that you know exactly where he is , and you are either getting ready to start chasing him , or already have . This is getting "" locked on "" . Now lets put this back into the aircraft context : A radar basically works like a giant , invisible flashlight . Each plane normally has it \'s radar in a "" scan "" or "" search "" mode , where it sweeps back and forth , scanning the whole sky for potential enemies . When it sees something ( i.e , when something bounces the light back at the radar ) the radar takes note of the position , [ puts it on a display in the cockpit for the pilot to see ] ( URL_0 ) , and continues scanning . If the pilot wants to track something ( or more importantly , try and shoot at it ) , he instructs the radar to point directly at the object it found earlier . Now , instead of sweeping around and only seeing the object intermittently , the radar points right at the target and delivers constant information on it \'s direction and speed . This is getting "" locked on "" or "" tracking "" . It \'s important to the other pilot , because like your friend playing flashlight tag , he knows when the light from your radar is hitting his aircraft . When the light switches from an intermittent ping to a constant stream , it means you are tracking him , know where he is , and either have already shot at him or are preparing to shoot . This is why getting "" locked on "" is a big deal . Edit : Now missiles . Going back to the flashlight tag analogy , let \'s say you \'re a big , heavy guy . You ca n\'t run too well or too fast , so if you tried to chase your friend yourself , he would easily run away . So , instead , you carry with you a lighter , smaller friend , who can run much faster and is much more agile than you are ( a missile ) . However , in order to run so fast , your little friend does n\'t carry his own heavy flashlight , he relies on the light from your flashlight so he can see the guy he \'s supposed to tag . So you have to keep your flashlight pointed at your target . This is Semi - Active Radar Homing ( SARH ) . In truth , I simplified the Radar system a bit in my first explanation . A radar system is not just a big , invisible flashlight , it also includes a special "" camera "" that allows you to see the light that bounces back from the target . So just like a flashlight just produces the light that allows your eyes to see your friend , the radar dish is just sending out light that the "" camera "" can then see reflected back from the target . The idea with semi - active radar homing is that in order to make our missiles as small , light , fast , and agile as possible , we do n\'t have to put a big radar dish in them , we can just put a little radar camera in them , and as long as * someone * is locked on with their radar ( the person that shot the missile , his friend in another plane , someone on the ground , etc . ) , the missile will use the light from their radar to see the target and guide itself in .', ""Warplanes can detect when they get hit by a radar pulse . When a radar system is just looking around for stuff , it will ping pretty infrequently , because it 's looking around at the whole sky . As it gets interested in something , say a plane , it will focus the area it 's looking , and be able to send more pulses to that area , which will increase the resolution and give its operators a better idea of where the object they 're looking for is . Once a missile is fired the radar , either on the ground or in the missile , will narrow down , further and further , as it wants to increase the accuracy and the refresh rate of the target , because smaller movements of the target plane become much more important to determining whether the missile hits , and become more important the nearer a the missile gets . All this means that planes receive an increasing number of radar pings and can consequently tell when the missile is getting nearer . You see this portrayed in films as pilots sitting in cockpits with increasingly frantic beeping as the missile gets nearer .""]",0,real,0.008509267,0,True

Could an old money prepster from Connecticut pass as white trash if he dressed a certain way and maybe spoke a bit differently ? Sure . It 's not really an ethnic thing . This is intuitively similar to how caste works in India , although I 'm sure someone will downvote me for taking a complex subject and distilling it so simply ."", 'The caste system is no longer so prevalent in India(as compared to older days ) and so there might not be a immediate discerning difference that you might be able to see . However , I \'m pointing out the fact that I live in an upper middle class area and so my answer will reflect my understanding and observations of this question , as compared to answering your entire question definitely . As all societies , class is relatively easily distinguished between . The area you live in , the way you speak , dress and behave all act as identifying factors . With caste , it \'s not so simple . There are thousands of castes in India , I \'m not sure of the exact number . Now , with the progression of society , many of the lower castes have risen up to make a decent living for themselves and can be indistinguishable from the general public . Of course , you could recognise the caste of people based on the general area and general physical features but you can never surely identify someone based on this . The last names of people usually can be an identifying factor of their caste , as people of the same caste share a set of last names . This is not true in all cases as the ancestors of certain lower caste members changed their surnames to something that was not associated with their caste in order to prevent discrimination from people from "" upper castes "" In today \'s day , I would say it \'s hard to identify someone \'s caste off hand but it \'s really not required day to day . Almost no one uses the old caste system , so it does n\'t really matter what caste you belong to . I doubt anyone apart from people living in extremely rural areas still maintain the practice of using a person \'s caste to judge their worth . Although one major fact that should be known is the governments current view on castes . Government institutions especially colleges and universities have reserved seats for SC / ST(Scheduled Castes / Scheduled Tribes ) so that they are not at a disadvantage in gaining seats for a course because of their background . While this does help people from less priveleged backgrounds get good education , it also causes a lot of people to take unfair advantage of the system . A lot of people who are well off and have a good education and living condition get to use the reserved quota system for their benefit even though they do n\'t need it . This reservation system also causes a whole lot of problem for the general category of people(which is a lot of people ) to get seats in university because barely any seats are left for them because of the reserved seats . Sorry if I expanded a bit too much , but I hope I answered your question . Here \'s a link if you want to read more about it .

The degree to which these profiles are accurate tends to increase with the number of data - points ( e.g. crime scenes ) that the profiler has to work with ( i.e. that are believed to be linked to the same offender ) . Profiling specific details ( e.g. a particular car model ) can not be done with any sort of accuracy unless the profiler has additional information ( e.g. physical evidence or eye - witness accounts ) which leads him / her to make such a conclusion . It is possible , however , that certain evidence may lead the profiler to suspect the criminal drives a certain type of vehicle . For example , evidence may suggest that the crime was politically motivated and the offender is an environmental protection activist . It may therefore be predicted that the offender drives an environmentally friendly electric / hybrid car . If , on the other hand , the criminal is suspected of being a hunter and weapons enthusiast , it may be predicted that he drives a utility truck of some sort which has lots of storage space . Criminal Profiling is still a hotly debated topic in Forensic Psychology because - although many profiles do turn out to be quite accurate - there are many criminals who are eventually caught and do n't end - up matching the predicted profile .

Based on that data they \'re able to predict certain things about an offender with a certain degree of accuracy : age ( or at least experience level ) , race -- since most sexual criminals tend to victimize those of their own race -- background / living situation , and so on .

Nuclear bombs are an area effect weapon so they work best when detonated at altitude this can be triggered in a number of different ways one of which is using the difference in pressure at different heights .', 'While some bombs are crude enough to rely on simple kinetic energy ( slamming into the ground ) to ignite , many â including nuclear bombs â are not set up that way and require a fuze . A fuze is just a little device that triggers the detonation . For a ground burst , a fuze might be a little button that gets pushed , which would set off a tiny explosion , that would set off the larger , main explosion . For an airburst , there are different kinds of fuzes that can be used either individually or together to make sure the bomb goes off at the right height . All of this applies to conventional as well as nuclear weapons , though with nuclear weapons it is especially important to have good fuzing because they will not typically explode in a nuclear fashion if they just slam into the ground without a fuze ( they are complicated devices that require precise timing to work ) Examples of aerial fuzing might include : * A timer that activates when the bomb leaves the plane or whatever . This is a very crude method but if you know it will take 45 seconds to fall to the right height , you can just time it . * A device that uses barometric pressure to detect how far up or down it is . The precision on this kind of thing can be tricky , but they have been used . * A device that serves essentially as a little radar antenna to detect where the ground is , by bouncing radio signals off of it . And so on . In the first atomic bombs , all three of these were used in a sequence to make sure that the bombs were more or less at the right altitude before they exploded ( the timer made such the bomb was outside of the plane , the barometric switch made sure it was below a certain altitude , and the radar antenna did the final check ) . You could even use GPS for this sort of thing , though there are errors that might be added .

The energy of the dance floor has reached an equilibrium . So now that the analogy is out of the way .

Your next question may be : how do you take heat from the inside of a fridge when it 's colder than ambient temperature ? Here 's the gist of it : it uses a property of compression .

On the opposite , a spray can gets cold when you use it . That 's because you 're releasing pressure , and that makes it colder . So a fridge use these principles of compression : there 's a fluid that goes through the radiator in the back , then through the insulated inside . When it 's in the radiator , it 's compressed so that it gets hotter and will lose some of its heat to the air around it . Then it goes inside where it is decompressed , which makes it colder and able to take more heat ."", ""Fridges rely on a thermodynamic process known as a [ Heat Pump . ] ( URL_0 ) A quick overview of how they work however : 1 . Electricicty from you wall outlet runs a compressor pump . This compresses the refrigerant fluid , creating a hot fluid at high pressure . - Remember when you compress a fluid , it gets warm . 2 . This hot fluid at high pressure goes through a condensor ( often called the radiator ) on the back of the fridge . This allows the hot fluid to cool down , by losing it 's excess heat to the ambient air . In doing this , the fluid condenses into a liquid . 3 . This high pressure liquid then goes through an expander / throttle valve . This essentially drops the pressure of the fluid : oposite to at point 1 , a decompressing fluid cools down . Because the high pressure fluid was at ambient temperature , the expanding fluid ( past the valve ) will chill below ambient temperature . 4 . The sub - cooled fluid is then passed through an evaporator ( a long coil burried in the body of the fridge ) where it absorbs heat from it 's surroudnings and vaporises the remainder of the refrigerant fluid . Because it draws heat from within the box , the inside of the fridge gets cooler . This vapour then goes into the compressor again , and it starts all over again !"", ""Fridges ( and air conditioners , etc ) produce more heat overall . But they can change the gradient of hot to cold . They can make the inside colder and the outside even hotter . Put your hand behind a fridge . It 's quite warm .

If you can spend energy and produce heat to condense a liquid ( the coolant ) outside of the box ( fridge or house ) that you want cold then you can pump it in there and rapidly expand it . If you remember high school physics , the same mass taking up more space will absorb heat and become colder . It 's an endothermic reaction .

Your fridge does the same thing . The coolant is compressed in to coils outside of your fridge . This causes it to loose heat . It is then decompressed as it re - enters the fridge , causing it to absorb heat energy and , thus , cooling your fridge .', ""ELI5 version : When you take a liquid and heat it up , it expands and becomes a gas ( boils ) . Conversely if you take a gas and cool it down , it contracts and becomes a liquid ( condenses ) . This is called a phase change , because you 're changing phases of the material between liquid and gaseous . Now you can also force a phase change to happen by manipulating pressure instead of heat . Namely if you take a liquid and reduce the pressure , it can evaporate into gas , and if you take a gas and compress it , it can condense into liquid . A phase change will always involve heat and volume . When you force a phase change with heat , you get volume as a result . When you force a phase change with volume ( pressure ) , you get heat as a result ! So when you take gaseous material and compress it enough to change phases to liquid , it releases heat in the process . Then when you reduce the pressure and allow it to boil / evaporate again , it wants to suck that heat back up , so it absorbs ambient heat , cooling itself down in the process ! We 've found a couple of substances , called refrigerants , that will readily accept a pressure - induced phase change at easily controllable pressures . So , you put this substance in a closed system , It 's pumped through a compressor and into a radiator . At the other end of that radiator is a small tube called a capillary or expansion valve , which connects to another radiator and back to the pump 's input . When you turn the pump on , refrigerant is pumped out of one radiator into the other . Since the expansion valve only allows a small amount of flow , one radiator gets pressurized , the other radiator gets depressurized . [ Here is a decent diagram of a cooling loop ] ( URL_0 ) In the pressurized radiator , connected to the pump 's output , the refrigerant pressure increases forcing it to phase change to liquid . In the process it releases its latent heat , and this radiator gets hot . This side is called the condenser , because the gas is condensed into liquid . The heat is bled away , so by the time the refrigerant reaches the expansion valve , it 's high - pressure liquid , at room temperature . Once it passes through the expansion valve into the low pressure radiator , it wants to expand . That pressure change forces a phase change from liquid to gas , and in the process it tries to absorb the latent heat it just released , and it gets cold in the process . This side is called the evaporator , because inside the coil liquid refrigerant evaporates into gaseous refrigerant . The result is a system which will effectively pump heat from one place to another . This concept , called a cooling loop or heat pump , is used in in all refrigerators and air conditioners . Your refrigerator has a heat pump . The cold side is inside the insulated refrigerator , usually in the freezer . Some of the freezer air is blown into the refrigerator segment to cool it . Most fridges have a thermostat to adjust the temperature , some also have a balance control to adjust the difference between freezer and fridge temp . The hot side of the cooling loop is above , behind or underneath the fridge . Air conditioners also use a heat pump .

How do insurance companies make money ? What if they pay out more than they take in ?

The game engine will render all those different pieces , and it \'s up to the artists , game designers , and programmers to merge those pieces together with the game engine to form the final product .

But they are generally designed to be reused so that every new game does n\'t have to re - invent the wheel . Game engines make money because game developers will license the engine for use .

I would then pay the developers of the Havoc engine for the use of the engine in my game .', ""A good example to understand it , is to look at Valve 's games .

When you have something like that , the only thing you need to create a new ( FPS , for that game engine ) game is basically create textures more fit to the world you want to represent , create new weapons with different projectile properties , create new enemies ( humanoid or others ) , and create the levels . It 's way less work than having to program the collision , graphics , controls and such all over again . Different game engines work for different types of games , and to recognize a game engine , the thing to look for is how the game reacts , if there 's ragdoll physics for example , or how steep of a hill you can climb , that sort of things .

"How does a turbocharger in a car work ? I know a bit about cars and how they work , but turbos are very foreign to me . Could someone explain how it is they work , in basic terms ? Explain like I'm five.","[""A turbocharger is two turbines joined by a shaft . One turbine is in the engine 's exhaust system , and is turned by the exhaust gasses . The other turbine is in the intake system , and turns because it 's hooked up to the first one . It pushes more air into the intake system . Because fuel only burns well when it 's mixed in a fairly narrow range of ratios with air , adding more air means you have to add more fuel . Using more fuel , and enough air to let it burn well , makes more power ."", 'BAsic engine knowledge : An engine is just an air pump . The power output of an engine is determined by how much aitr you can pass through it . Bigger engines are more powerful because each revolution pumps more air through it . Engines that turn faster ( higher revving ) are more powerful because they pass air through at a higher rate . However , a limiting factor on this is atmospheric pressure : When the piston descends and cylinder creates a partial vacuum , and atmospheric pressure forces air into the cylinder . Atmospheric pressure is therefore a limiting factor on engine power . This is a really big problem when atmospheric pressure drops - at altitude for example . If we couple this with another problem - engines waste lots of energy by letting it flow out of the exhaust as heat , then we come up with a solution : If we place a turbine in the exhaust flow , it recovers energy from the hot exhaust gasses and spins fast . Really fast . Turbos can spin at 150,000 rpm which represents a huge amount of energy . The clever bit is that we connect the shaft of the turbine to a compressor , at the intake side of the engine . This compressor builds boost , which overcomes the limitation of atmospheric pressure . Suddenly we have taken "" lost "" energy , and recycled it into boost , by using a turbo . This allows a smaller capacity engine to flow more air and produce power like a much larger engine , whilst being smaller and more efficient ( thermodynamically speaking ) . We \'ve overcome the limitation of atmospheric pressure in "" filling "" the piston with air . And it \'s a positive feedback mechanism too : The engine burns more fuel , produces MORE heat , which turns the turbo faster , giving you potentially MORE boost to use . In actuality , boost is limited to prevent engine damage . A wastegate bleeds off exhaust gas past the turbine to regulate it \'s speed , and a dump valve can open to dump boost on the intake side to prevent the turbo stalling suddenly when the throttle is shut .

"How does a turbocharger work in a car ? I understand you can significantly boost the hp of a car with not much weight added with a turbocharger , but what exactly is happening in there that creates that extra power ? Explain like I'm five.","[""That 's kind of how it works but there are a few distinct things to point out . See diagrams on this page . URL_0 Essentially your cars engine is an air pump . Fuel is ignited and hot gasses are created , these expand rapidly and force pistons to move . In a turbo charged vehicle , the exhaust gasses generated in combustion are used to drive a turbine that has a compressor attached to the front of it , that in turn compresses some of the air being taken in by the engine and forces it into the cylinder with the rest of the air that was headed there . More air in the cylinder is good for a few reasons , one because your car is an air pump and more air inside the cylinder allows for more fuel to be added and ignited which in turns generates more hot and rapidly expanding gas which again increases cylinder pressure . Why could n't we just add more fuel then you might ask ? Because we ca n't ignite fuel in a car without the presence of air . Too much fuel and the ratio falls out of balance and less power ( hot expanding gasses as the fuel does n't burn properly ) . Same goes for too much air , why do n't we just make the turbo push in more air ? Because too much compressed air from the turbo ( which is quite hot and is the reason intercoolers exist ) could prematurely ignite the fuel mixture before it should ( which runs the risk of causing engine damage ) and also upsets the balance that an engine prefers to produce maximum power ( produce the greatest amount and best temperature of hot gasses to push the pistons . So , if you follow all that . Engines are essentially an air pump , turbo 's compress air and force it into the cylinder which allows for more fuel to be burned which in turn results in more hot gasses being created - this increases the pressure in the cylinder which in turn forces the piston down ."", 'Fire is created when you mix oxygen and a fuel source in the presence of heat . It generally results in gasses that expand . Air is a pretty good source of oxygen . Gasoline is a good fuel & burns really well . The engine of a car creates power by combining gasoline and air then burning them . The expanding gasses are used to drive engine cylinders . When you press down your gas pedal , you get more gasoline in the cylinder , creating more powerful explosions . This works up to the point where you have as much gas as your air can make burn - past that point , adding more gas does nothing but waste gas . A turbocharger uses a turbine to force more air into the cylinder , allowing you to burn more gas than you could with a normal engine that just "" sucks air in "" . More air + more gas = bigger explosions = more power . A supercharger does the same thing but powers the fan differently . A turbocharger uses the leftover gases coming out of the engine to drive the fan while a supercharger uses the \' spinning power \' coming out of the engine to drive the fan .', 'Simply put , it forces more air into the engine which makes it work more efficiently . Since combustion engines work essentially by creating explosions in a small space , the more air you can force in there the higher the pressure and the greater the energy output .']",0,real,0.0074765356,0,True

I guess I 'm specifically interested in definitions of things like IP addresses , LANs and routers and all that computer jargon . Explain like I'm five.","['Every computer on a network needs to have a unique identifying number , which is the IP ( Internet Protocol ) address . Actually , the IP address is n\'t the address of the computer itself , but rather the address of the computer \'s network interface . A router is a device that connects computers to each other . As such , it has lots of interfaces ( sockets ) into which you can plug a network cable . The outside internet connection will have an IP address allocated to it by the ISP , and all the internal network connections will have their IP addresses allocated to them by the router . Certain ranges of IP addresses are reserved for internal networks , and one such range starts with 192.168 - so your outside IP address may be something like 1.2.3.4 , your router \'s internal IP address may be something like 192.168.0.1 , and your router will allocate IP addresses to the devices on your network , maybe 192.168.0.2 for the PC , 192.168.0.3 for your phone , 192.168.0.4 for your XBox and so on . The router \'s main job is to "" route "" traffic around the network . It knows if a request for a web page has come from your PC it \'ll route the reply back to your PC . If the request for something else ( game data for example ) has come from the XBox , the reply goes to the XBox .

LAN just stands for Local Area Network , which is the sort of setup I \'ve described above .

When you download stuff you normally send a letter saying you would like to receive something from someone else ( their IP ) , then they send a letter back saying OK , then you and that person send letter back and forth ( a hand - shake , how a TCP connection is established ) .

In the case of hieroglyphics , as others here have already pointed out , linguists were very fortunate to have found the Rosetta Stone . But mostly , it \'s a case of using the same kind of techniques used to crack codes and ciphers , except it \'s much more difficult .

For example , suppose a Martian found a few books in English and wanted to decipher it . One of the first things he might notice is that at one corner of each page is a sequence of signs that follow a very regular pattern . He might guess that this is a counting system , and that each page was carefully numbered .

It \'s through this kind of process that he gradually builds up a picture of the English language . If he has a way of knowing what kind of book he \'s holding in his tentacles ( "" Wait , is that a representation of an atom ? Could this be a chemistry textbook ?

It has upon it a decree from King Ptolemy V in 196 BC in three languages : hieroglyphs , demotic script and ancient Greek . The decree is basically a "" Yo , Ptolemy V and his wife are totally boss and all the priests are like super impressed and stuff , and you should be too , \' k ? "" style of message .

Hardly anybody knew how to read this , but there was this Swedish guy who had a bit of a handle on it , and could confirm that it was indeed the same text as the Greek , so that meant the hieroglyphs were likely to be the same text too . In 1811 a man called Silvestre de Sacy is thinking about the problem and considering a suggestion that the foreign names in hieroglyphs are phonetic . He does nothing about it until another guy called Thomas Young , wrote to him about the stone in 1814 , when de Sacy suggests he finds the cartouches that might contain Greek names , and see if he can find phonetic characters in them . Thomas Young does so and decodes the name of Ptolemy and a bunch of other characters as a result . This is good result .

Champollion takes another look at his lithograph of the stone and is able to find the cartouche for "" kleopatra "" and realises he can build a phonetic alphabet . It takes another 20 years for Champollion to fill in the gaps , but he and others do so and by 1832 there is a good understanding of what \'s going on .

How does NASA and other space agency âs manage to land a rover / probe on an moving asteroid ? Title .

Got that down quite well with multi - stage rockets . The second is getting to the asteroid and matching its orbit . Got that down quite well with the ability to figure out where the asteroid 's orbit will take it . The third is selecting a spot to land . That can be performed by imaging the asteroid and determining a likely spot . The final one is programming the propulsion systems on the orbiter part to drop its lander on the asteroid . With all the data you 've collected so far , this is also achievable using sophisticated computer - driven propulsion systems with distance - detection measurement devices and self - correcting capability . All of that stuff , we have now . We just need to do a lot of tweaking and testing and solid engineering to make it all work together ."", ""Others have already given the explanation , I just want to address an underlying assumption you seem to be making : You might as well ask how people managed to land on a moving moon , i.e. our Moon . Nothing in space is standing still . Everything is moving in orbit around something else . Our sun orbits around the centre of the galaxy . Our galaxy and the local galaxy group orbit around their centre of gravity . What you want to do is make sure you orbit the centre of gravity ( the Sun , in this case ) at the same speed and with the same orbital parameters that the asteroid does . So it 's like the car analogy that u / Xalteox made : when you 're next to an asteroid at exactly the same speed , you would n't notice that the asteroid is moving . So how do we get to the asteroid ? Very basically ( and I 'll skip the launch part ) , you 're in Earth orbit , travelling a few hundred kilometres above the surface at around 7,700 m / s - that 's roughly 17,000 mph or 28,000 km / h. We need to change our orbit so it crosses that of the asteroid . Timing is important - crossing the asteroid 's orbit when it 's on the other side of the sun is useless . The time where you can burn to intercept is the transfer window . Theoretically , it would n't matter that much , only you would need very , * very * large amounts of fuel , a much larger engine to propel the much heavier spacecraft and maybe several billions of dollars . That 's not feasable , so we wait for the transfer window . Once it comes , we burn the engine for a while until we 're at such a speed that Earth 's gravity can no longer pull us back around . Think of a car on a racetrack that 's too fast to go around a curve and skids off the track - that 's what we 're trying to do here . Only our result will be that we 'll change from orbiting Earth to orbiting the Sun . Once we are at the intercept point ( and hopefully we got everything right and the asteroid is also there ) , we burn the engines again for a while , changing our speed until our orbit of the Sun matches that of the asteroid . And then we do what the other posters said : use thrusters to gently manoeuvre us down to the surface . As I said , this is the very basic version . If you want to try something like that , I 'll shamelessly advise you to download the free demo version of Kerbal Space Program from Steam .

"How do waves transfer Energy I m talking about Tsunami waves . How much energy does it transfer ? Where does it come from , where does it go ? How fast do they move ? Please explain like I'm five.","[""Tsunami waves like all ocean waves occur because two molecules ca n't be in the same place at the same time . This is a basic fact of fluid dynamics . So when waves ' move ' the water is mostly staying in the same place because it moves very little . But it bumps up against the water molecules around it giving up their energy and stopping as they 've given it up . But whatever molecules they just bumped into now have the energy and so they move a short distance , bump into something , give it up and stop etc . It 's like those desktop toys with the metal balls clanking back and forth . The balls themselves do n't move , or they move very little . They mostly act as a conductor of energy . So a tsunami originating in Japan travels as an energy wave ' through ' the water . The water itself does n't move so Japanese water stays in Japan even if the tsunami is moving towards Hawaii . This is also the reason why at sea a tsunami is not even really noticeable . The energy is spread out immensely from top to bottom , so you have a huge mass of water bouncing around but the wave is only centimeters high . It still has energy because of how much water is in play though . As the wave approaches shallower depths , the energy stops being spread out among large masses of water , and starts being concentrated , by the decreasing depth , and the wave starts growing taller and taller . This focusing of the energy also causes the waves to slow down in speed , and increase in height . In the open ocean a tsunami energy wave travels incredibly fast , like jet speed fast . As it comes up onto shore though it 's much slower , but much taller , and at that point water is moving not just acting as a conductor . The slow waves at the coast , with fast waves coming in behind it , causes a surge , pushing large amounts of water near the shore so not only do the waves get tall , but the local sea level also rises . This is why the water on land looks like it 's risen and flooded instead of just immediately washing back out to sea ."", 'thermal energy in earths magma below crust > kinetic energy in tectonic plates ( earthquakes underwater ) > kinetic energy in water . the energy is then lost in a lot of ways , i m guessing , at a fundamental level , because work is done against gravity as it moves out of the sea , but also friction with everything the tsunami contacts according to this link URL_0 the 2011 tsunami in japan had an energy ~1.3x10 ^ 14 Joules ( as a low estimate )', 'So , think of it this way , little Tim - Tom - Mathis - Tong , our planet is n\'t exactly solid .

So these plates are just floating on top of liquid magma , and every now and then the plates collide or separate . When this happens , those plates actually moving sends a huge shock wave out into the water . The thing about liquids is that they act like they \'re composed of a bunch of little bouncy balls . Now , what happens if you push one bouncy ball in a stack of bouncy balls ? The other balls move . So , when this plate releases this huge shock into the water , it creates a "" wave "" of movement that emits from wherever the center point of those plates touching was . As the balls keep moving away they dissipate that energy , or speed , to each other ball . But as the energy wave goes closer to land , it has less and less balls to push . So that energy becomes more concentrated , and it becomes so concentrated that it creates a massive wave of water ! AND BOOM ! IT KILLS GODZILLA !

This is called the "" n - body problem "" . For very simple problems we can solve this exactly . For example , if the sun was concentrated into one tiny point ( but still weighed the same ) and the earth was another tiny point and the earth was the only planet , the earth would go around the sun repeating a kind of lopsided circle called an ellipse .

The voice actors come in to record their lines , and then the animators have to work around those recordings , trying to translate the meaning and emotion of the voicework into the movements and expressions of the animation . After that , they just put the two together and they both sync up perfectly because the animation was tailored for the voice itself . In fact , in a lot of cases , some characters are practically born straight from the voice . Take Sherri Stoner for example , series writer and voice actress of Slappy the Squirrel from Animaniacs . The different people involved were pitching ideas for different characters to appear in the show . Sherri shared her idea of an aged retired cartoon actress which was a great idea on its own .

Let 's say there is a foreign hand drawn animated film from Japan like Spirited Away for example .

It 's the same regular schtick with voice actors dubbing over what 's happening in the film , but do n't really have to pay attention to the mouths ; they mostly have to pay attention to the timing to make sure they do n't go over or under the allotted time slot .

How does 83b election work when paying fair market value at time of grant?,"['The tax cost at election should be zero.  The appreciation is all capital gain beyond your basis, which will be the value at election. IRC Â§83 applies to property received as compensation for services, where the property is still subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture.  It will catch unvested equity given to employees. Â§83(a) stops taxation until the substantial risk of forfeiture abates (i.e. no tax until stock vests) since the item is revocable and not yet truly income.  Â§83(b) allows the taxpayer to make a quick election (up to 30 days after transfer - firm deadline!) to waive the substantial risk of forfeiture (e.g. treat shares as vested today). The normal operation of Â§83 takes over after election and the taxable income is generally the value of the vested property minus the price paid for it.  If you paid fair market value today, then the difference is zero and your income from the shares is zero. The shares are now yours for tax purposes, though not for legal purposes.  That means they are most likely a capital asset in your hands, like other stocks you own or trade.  The shares will not be treated as compensation income on vesting, and vesting is not a tax matter for elected shares. If you sell them, you get capital gain (with tax dependent on your holding period) over a basis equal to FMV at the election.  The appreciation past election-FMV will be capital gain, rather than ordinary income.  This is why the Â§83(b) election is so valuable.

At the end of your turn , if you ever have more than seven cards you have to discard cards until you have seven . Lands are the most basic card .

After that is a long period of cyclic rem sleep until you launch out of it . No delta sleep is ' normal ' , after the delta sleep cycle , is a period of recouping a lot of REM sleep . This is because obviously as mammals for quite sometime we were nt necessarily safe sleeping 8 whole hours in a deep enough sleep to heal up and rest up our gigantic brains .

This is called pinyin . This is basically the phonetic transcription of the language . There are then 4 corresponding tones in Chinese . Flat ( 1 ) , Rising ( 2 ) , Falling - Rising ( 3 ) and Falling ( 4 ) . The word ' train - station ' in Mandarin is huÇchÄzhÃ n . So you type it out like that but add the tones by adding a number after the corresponding character . ( But not every character has a tone . ) So huÇchÄzhÃ n would be huo3che1zhan4 and this would type out as ç«è½¦ç«"", 'There are many many ways to type in Chinese , but I \'ll list the common ones only : 1 . Pinyin : This is the standard romanization for the PRC where characters are written in the Latin alphabet . Like /u / kabajingai said , you can type the entire romanization out to get your desired word . However , this is pretty time - consuming , so most people usually remove the tone numbers when typing . You can go even further and shorten a word like æå , peng2you5 ( friend ) to just "" py "" because "" py "" is not a valid syllable so the system recognizes it as an abbreviation . 2 . Zhuyin / Bopomofo : This system was used in China before the standard Latin phonetic transcription came about in the 1950s , but now it is only used in Taiwan . It functions in the same as pinyin , but instead of Latin letters , you have distorted Chinese characters that almost resemble Japanese katakana . Each symbol represents a specific morpheme , and tonal marks similar to those in pinyin are used to represent the tones . 3 . Wubihua : The first two systems were phonetically - based , but this one is handwriting - based . All Chinese characters have a standard stroke order ( order of the lines you have to draw to make the character ) , and there are only five buttons in this system you can press to get your desired character . There are ~34 types of strokes in Chinese , but some of them are very similar to each other , so Wubihua classifies the 34 strokes into either a horizontal , vertical , falling to the left , falling to the right / dots , and turning strokes ( which are a combination of any of the previously four as long as you do n\'t lift the pencil when writing ) . 4 . Wubi and Cangjie : These are also writing - based , but instead use the radicals that make up the characters . These are more complicated to learn as a beginner because the rules and algorithms might seem a bit strange at first . Cangjie is based on geometrical distribution , and I am not familiar with the typing at all , so do n\'t ask me about it . Wubi is simpler imo because it is purely based on radicals and strokes . It \'s like a faster Wubihua where common stroke orders that might take six keyboard presses are transformed into one keyboard press . 5 . Drawing : And of course , you can actually draw the character on the screen if your phone supports it . I like this way better because my handwriting is faster than typing , and it \'s neat enough that my phone can register what the hell I \'m typing . Usually when you draw , the character will be distorted from what your computer - written fonts look like , cause messy handwriting and stuff .', 'There is way to read and spell Chinese characters .

"How do our bodies "" read "" DNA ? I know that DNA is the order of chemicals telling the body / cells what to do , but how do the cells know what the DNA means ? Explain like I'm five. ","['Well , the cells do n\'t exactly "" know "" what the DNA means , per se . The process of converting genes ( DNA ) into their functional output , typically proteins , begins with a process called transcription . During this process , an enzyme ( a type of protein ) scans the DNA and makes a copy of a gene . But , instead of copying it in the form of DNA , it makes a copy of it in the form of RNA . A good analogy to this would be if your mother emailed you a recipe and you did n\'t have a printer handy , so you wrote instead , you write it down . The message still says the same thing , but it is in printed handwriting instead of electronic data . The next step in the process is converting that RNA information into something that is functional , a protein . This happens in a cell structure called the ribosome . The newly created RNA enters the ribosome , and through a process called translation . Essentially , the ribosome "" decodes "" the RNA and translates it into the language or proteins . A cells in every living organism convert the RNA information into proteins using the same genetic code by reading it in three letter ( A , C , G , T ) chunks called codons . The codons tell the ribosome how to build the protein and when to stop adding pieces . These pieces are called amino acids . Going back to the analogy , this is like you reading the recipe , combining the ingredients , and cooking it in the correct way .

How do nighttime rainbows function ? p.s . did n't know it was a thing till today .

How do Siamese twins work ? How do Siamese twins decide who does what with their body ? For example ; if one twin has to go to the bathroom and the other does nât . Who controls the twins bodily functions ? Explain like I'm five. ,"['As far as I know , there is only one set of conjoined twins this applies to : Abby and Brittany Hensel . Their entire bodies , except for their heads , are conjoined . They each control one half of their conjoined parts , so they have to work in tandem for everything . For example , each controls one leg so it was thought at first that they âd never be able to walk because coordinating is too difficult . But they managed to do it , establishing a rhythm and intuitively sensing the walking rhythm . They have nât spoken about toilet issues as far as I know , though I would imagine the same principle would apply . When they were little , one of them tended to be the one to do most of the eating , with the other saying she was nât hungry . Since they share one digestive system , they could do this without harm . The reason I say it only applies to them is that the degree to which they are conjoined is more extensive than with most other conjoined twins . There could be others but they âre not in the public eye . And there was a set that was conjoined in a similar fashion in the UK . The parents decided to separate them , and one died . That case is one of the reasons why the Hensels decided not to separate their girls . There âs another set of conjoined twins in Canada , Tatiana and Krista Hogan , whose brains are conjoined but their bodies are separate . They âre 11 .

Identical twins are where a single sperm fertilizes a single egg and somewhere along the line , the embryo splits in two , so you get two individuals that are genetically identical .

How do scientists know that the moon was formed from two planets colliding ? and how do they know how long ago it happened ? Please explain like I'm five.,"[""The reasoning goes like this : The Moon missions brought back Moon rocks , which when studied , revealed that the Moon is primarily compromised of a kind of rock also found on Earth . Hence , scientists believe that the Moon 's material came from Earth at some point . They also know that when Earth was formed , the material comprising it was mostly homogeneous . It was n't until millions of years later that the different types of rocks and materials began to stratify , or organize themselves by density ( dense things sank to the core , while lighter things were displaced ) . Since the Moon 's material is not only identical to the rocks on Earth , they are also mixed . This tells scientists that the event which created the Moon happened * before * the layers had a chance to properly layer themselves , as we see now . So essentially we know that there is a timeline of de - homogenation that began shortly after the Earth was done , and careful analysis of the Moon rocks can show us where about on that timeline the material came from ."", ""Calculus , geology , mineral study , carbon dating , and very good instruments . We know that the moon is made of the same stuff as the Earth . We know that it 's orbit is getting farther and farther away as time goes on , and the Earths rate of rotation is getting slower .

So if you have an ever increasing distance , and an ever slowing rate of rotation , and you play that scenario backwards towards the distant past , then you see the moon getting ever closer to the Earth , and the Earth spinning faster and faster . The most plausible explanation for this behavior , for the mineral makeup of the moon compared to the Earth , as well as the Earth 's own geology in the oldest rocks ever found , we can plausibly say that the moon is made of material that was ejected from the Earth in a massive impact some 4.5 billion years ago in a massive collision . The object that struck the much smaller proto - Earth was the size of Mars and it hit at tens of thousands of miles per hour , obliterating both bodies and ejecting material out into space where it formed a ring system as the new Earth 's gravity pulled it back . Over time this ring system became lumpy and began collecting in larger and larger chunks as gravity drew small to large . The heat of this gravitational pull rendered the moon molten and the surface a kind of basaltic lava flow . The impact also had the Earth spinning incredibly fast with a day lasting about 6 hours long . It took billions of years for it to slow to a 24 hour day and for the moon to move as far away as it has ."", 'When astronauts brought back "" moon rocks "" , and scientists did their sciency things to those rocks , they quickly realized those "" moon rocks "" were almost 99.9 % similar to earth rocks']",0,real,0.0065930216,0,True
How does a Turing machine work and what does it do All I know is it 's in a CPU and it manipulates binary data Explain like I'm five.,"['A Turing machine is * not * in a CPU and it does * not * manipulate binary data . It is important to not start with false assumptions , I think . :-) A Turing machine is more like a rule - based game than a physical toy . Think of it like the game Solitaire . You start with a deck of shuffled cards and lay them out according to the rules of the game . This is one part of the Turing machine , which we call the input . The next part of the Turing machine is the end state --- this describes the conditions when the game has ended . In Solitaire you win by getting all your cards into numerical ordered columns ; and you lose by getting through all your cards without managing to do this , so you have no further options . The third important part of the Turing machine is the rules of the game : at each stage it tells you which moves you can make . In some types of game there are several moves you can make at each step , and it \'s a matter of the player to choose . Others there is no choice and the fun of the game comes from having it unfold in front of you even though you ca n\'t affect the outcome . The Turing machine was invented to make formal the notion of rules and processes . The question that Alan Turing wanted to answer was about the "" end game "" . Is it possible to know whether you will win a game of Solitaire without playing the game of Solitaire ? Could you be stuck in an endless loop if there was no way to lose , only to win ? In the process of answering this question he realised that he could write down each of his Turing machines as a grouping of symbols , like { input , rules , end conditions } and that would be a complete definition of that Turing machine . This would be the ultimate formal definition of Solitaire , or whatever . But once you \'ve got a definition of a Turing machine as a series of symbols , you can feed that to a Turing machines whose rules tell it how to recognise symbols . So let \'s say I have a Turing machine called SolTM = { input deck , Solitaire rules , end conditions } . And I have a new one called UTM = { input TM , rules , end conditions } . If I manipulate SolTM using the rules defined in UTM then I am making the UTM _ act like SolTM _ . This is the essence of Alan Turing \'s _ Universal Turing Machine _ , a device that can pretend to be other devices if given a description of how they work . I appreciate this may be some pretty hairy stuff , and over the heads of most 25 year - olds :-) but it \'s also the foundations of our understanding of computation , ie the question of "" mechanically "" producing an output from input+rules .', ""Wikipedia does a decent job , so I 'll try to simplify that a bit more ( at the expense of exactness ) . A turing machine is * not * a physical machine ( though people have made them ) . It is a theoretical object which is used to model , in a sense , the simplest possible computer . It is fed an input , and can return ' yes ' or ' no ' ( or continue forever ) . An example ( and a good exercise ) is to ' build ' a machine to test if an integer is divisible by 9 . The input would then be the integer , and the machine would return ' yes ' or ' no ' at the end . Say you have an infinite tape of symbols , and a ' head ' , which the tape is fed to , and which can be in different ' states ' or ' modes ' . At each symbol , the head takes some action . An action could be ' if the head is in state 1 and if the symbol is an A , erase the A and write B , change to state 2 , and move three spaces to the right ' , or ' if the head is in state 2 and the symbol is a C , return yes and quit ' . To test for divisibility by nine , the machine might be as follows : the input tape contains the number written in decimal notation , with one digit per space . We would have ten states , 0 , 1 , 2 , ... 9 . The rules would be : ' start in state 0 and move to the first symbol ' , and ' at each symbol , add the symbol to the current state and add the digits until we have a number less than 10 , then move right one space ' , and ' if we hit a blank space and we are in state 9 or 0 , return yes . otherwise return no ' . This uses the idea that if the sum of digits is divisible by 9 , then the number is divisible by 9 . Try this out with , say , 574281 as an input to see how the machine works . A turing machine is not a model of a real computer . It is , however , theoretically capable of doing anything a real computer can do . The simplicity of turing machines compared to real computers makes them very useful for proving things , because if something can not be done with a turing machine , it can not be done with any equivalent computing machine . They are also used extensively for algorithm analysis . The number of ' actions ' taken by the machine is a useful measurement of how fast an algorithm is ."", 'The general idea is that you have a machine that reads an infinite tape and keeps track of what state it \'s in . The tape tells you what to do next ( read the next instruction , read the last one , etc ) . A Turing machine is totally abstract so the tape can be infinite in length , but you can only have a finite number of states . The important thing to keep in mind here is that there \'s no difference between data and instructions . CPUs work in more or less the same fashion , except that the "" tape "" ( memory ) is finite , thus a language is said to be "" Turing complete "" if it supports all the possible operations that a Turing machine can process . Another important point : Turing machines are where theory hits the pavement -- you can prove things about Turing machines based only on math , but the same can not be said about real world computers .

"How do video game mods work ? With so many awesome and crazy mods out there , how are they created and able to be in - game ? Please explain like I'm five.","[""The biggest games for modding are open world games like GTA and Fallout / Skyrim . For major mods , like an entire new campaign , the game was built in a way that they could release DLCs that add more already , so the mod just takes advantage of that . Visual mods simply replace the model or texture , so when it calls for them , something else comes . When it mods how fast you are , or how high you jump , there 's already coding that dictates those functions in the engine . Since the engine is built to be used in multiple games , most attributes are controlled by a settings file that can easily be found , opened in notepad , and you just change the numbers , which changes the attributes"", 'This really depends on the game . Many games nowadays have build in tools to mod ( editors ) . They let you change variables that define the game mechanics . Some let you even add new "" rules "" by allowing some form of scripting to be added to the game ( good exmaples are Starcraft 2 or Dota 2 , both of them have very powerful editors , that make it possible to mod pretty much every aspect of the game ) . Other games do nt allow this , its harder to mod those , it can be done by actually digging the games files , replacing a texture file for example or config files that contains variable definitions .', ""Imagine you work at a local restaurant and the game as a finished dish . When someone orders an item that is n't commonly made , you need to pull out your recipe book and follow the instructions to make the dish . You know how to perform all the tasks involved in preparing a dish , but you need to follow the recipe to do it properly . This is basically how your computer runs a game normally . It follows instructions using the resources provided . Now if someone wanted to change the dish , they could fill your salt shaker with sugar or your oregano container with parsley . So when you need to make a salty dish it ends up sweet . This is how most visual mods are made . They take an existing game file and replace it with something else so when the game calls for a mesh of a dragon , it instead loads one of Macho Man Randy Savage . If someone wanted more control over how you make the dish , they could also write new instructions in your recipe book . They could change a recipe to have you dice garlic instead of pressing it or add a new line that says to add a teaspoon of allspice . If you are to complete the dish as the modder intends , they can only add instructions that you know how to perform otherwise something will likely go wrong . This is how many gameplay or AI mods are made and also why they tend to be limited in scope . Modders can alter what instructions the game engine sees while running to change how it handles different input / files / objects . Modern game engines are usually made to handle a limited set of tasks so the games behavior generally can not be altered beyond the limits of the supported instructions . Obviously , it 's a lot more complicated than this . I did n't account for mods like ENB or whatever black magic Mod Organizer uses as I have no idea how they work .

How does a computer boot ? What is that which brings the hardware to life ? How does the code communicate with hardware to do things ? Please explain like I'm five.,"['On a very basic level , the hardware is designed in such a way that it recognizes electric pulses as either ones or zeroes . Once you grapple with that , it all goes from there . And I \'ve definitely been in your place , trust me . Going through CompTIA courses and like "" Okay but * * * how * * * ? "" Seriously the main and underlying thing is that : every piece of a computer ( and I \'m talking really about the motherboard , I guess ) is designed to read those electrical signals as something . Once you have something plugged into the wall , it \'s easy to "" make "" electrical pulses , and that \'s exactly what a computer does . Each layer gets more technical . Until you have this webpage ( simple ) or Overwatch ( hard ) .', 'Inside the computer \'s CPU is something called the "" program counter "" , which keeps track of what the computer is doing . It points to the bit of memory that contains the next instruction the computer needs to execute . When the computer is first turned on , the program counter points to a bit of memory in a special chip called "" BIOS "" . BIOS contains instructions to do a number of different things , such as let the operating system talk to the hardware , and let the user configure some of the hardware ... but the main thing we \'re interested in if we \'re talking about booting , is that the BIOS contains a user - configurable list of where to look for the boot device . You might set this to check the CD drive first of all , for example . And if the CD drive does n\'t contain a bootable CD ( which it usually wo n\'t ) , then it might check the hard disk next . The hard disk will normally have a bootable operating system on it , such as Windows . So now , the BIOS loads the first part of Windows from the hard disk and runs it . And that is responsible for loading everything else that needs to be loaded .', 'A computer consists of CPU and memory . Memory is the simpler chip to understand -- memory consists of a large array of * memory cells * , each of which can contain a 0 or a 1 ( a single bit ) . The cells are divided into groups of 8 , each group can contain 8 bits ( one byte ) . Each 8 - bit group is numbered with an * address * which is simply a number ( coded in binary ) that identifies the cell . So for example , the CPU can tell memory "" write 00101101 into cell number 1493 "" . Then at a later point in time , the computer can tell memory "" read the contents of cell number 1493 "" and memory will respond with "" 00101101 "" . The address 1493 is itself coded as a sequence of bits , so the CPU would actually say "" read / write the contents of cell number 0000010111010101 "" . A typical CPU / memory interface consists of a number of * lines * which are several copper wires that physically connect the CPU to the memory : - Address lines . The CPU puts the coded address of the cell it wants to work with ( such as 0000010111010101 ) on these 16 lines . - Data lines . The data ( 00101101 ) goes on these 8 lines . In the case of writing data into memory , the CPU sets the data lines . In the case of reading data from memory , the memory sets the data lines . - R / W bit . A single line which the CPU sets to 0 when it wants to read from memory , 1 when it wants to write to memory . - Clock . Pulses on this line dictate the timing of exactly when the memory / CPU should read / write the address / data lines . How quickly the clock pulses occur determines how quickly memory can be read / written . Making it faster increases system performance , but also increases the physical speed requirements of the CPU / memory chips . The CPU works by reading memory at the program counter , executing the instruction based on what it does , and incrementing the program counter to get it to the next instruction . For example , 37 might be the code for "" load the number 0 into register A "" , the 3 - byte sequence 87 21 63 might be the code for "" load the number 6321 into register B "" , 88 34 14 might be the code for "" load the number 3414 into register C "" and 22 might be the code for "" add register A to register C , then store the result in register A. "" ( A * register * is a small number of memory cell circuits inside the CPU which serve as a "" scratch pad "" or "" short term memory "" for the CPU to store values internally . ) If we wanted to do these things in a program , it would be 37 87 21 63 88 34 14 22 which would go into consecutive memory cells . Let \'s put 37 87 21 63 88 34 14 22 into memory cells at addresses 2100 , 2101 , 2102 , 2103 , etc . then set the PC to 2100 , and let the CPU run . The CPU reads a 37 from address 2100 , increments PC to 2101 and executes the instruction to set register A to 0 . PC is now 2101 , so the CPU reads an 87 from address 2101 , increments PC to 2102 , sees that 87 is code for a three - byte instruction , fetches the first additional byte 21 from PC ( which is 2102 ) , increments PC to 2103 , fetches a second additional byte 63 from PC , increments PC to 2104 . The CPU now has the three bytes needed for the second instruction and loads 6321 into register B. The CPU keeps on doing this fetch - decode - execute loop forever ( or until powered down ) . Now that you know how CPU and memory work , the boot process is simple : Physically hard wired in the CPU is a number called a * reset vector * ( like all numbers in a computer , it \'s coded in binary ) . Upon system power - up or reset , the CPU copies the reset vector into the program counter . It \'s up to the system designer to include a memory chip which will respond to the reset vector address and contain a useful program . On the PC , this memory chip is called * BIOS * . The initial chip is referred to as a ROM ( read only memory ) , because in the early days it was literally hard wired with the program . In modern times ROM \'s are flash chips ( the technology in USB disks , smart phones and modern SSD hard drives ) , so the ROM is n\'t truly "" read only "" ( it can be written to ) , but it \'s still called ROM to distinguish it from "" ordinary "" memory or RAM ( which is much faster , but loses data when powered down ) . Now your second question : How code communicates with hardware . As well as being connected to memory , the CPU has extra pins which can be connected to other devices . There are CPU instructions to read and write the electrical state of these pins . There are a number of standardized communication methods for sending data over these extra pins ( serial , SPI , I2C , ISA , PCI ) . Also you can have devices which are n\'t memory cells connected to the memory bus and respond to memory addresses ( "" memory - mapped I / O "" ) . So really the heart of the computer is the CPU + memory which makes it possible to execute a program consisting of stored instructions . For everything else you just need a physical connection to the CPU and a way to access that connection from the software level of stored instructions . The vast array of devices in a typical computer -- screens and keyboards to communicate with humans , networking to communicate with other computers , hard drives to store gobs of data permanently , speakers , video camera , microphone -- they \'re all just literally separate devices that are electronically designed to be computer controlled and mechanically designed to fit snugly in the same case ( or on the same circuit board ) as the CPU / memory .']",0,real,0.006285028,0,True

How do historically low interest rates affect real estate prices?,"[""Interest rates do generally affect house prices but other factors do too, especially the unemployment rate. However, everything else being equal, when interest rates drop, it makes the borrowing of money cheaper so tends to stimulate the economy and the housing market, increasing the demand for houses and generally causes house prices to increase (especially if the supply of new housing doesn't increase with the demand). When interest rates go up the opposite happens. Usually interest rates go down in order to stimulate  a slowing economy and interest rates go up to slow down an overheated economy. Regarding your situation you are able to get a 30 year fixed rate at todayâs interest rates (in Australia the longest fixed rate you can get is for 10 years and the rate is usually 1 or 2 percent higher than the standard variable rate. Most people here go for the variable rate or a fixed rate of between 1 to 3 years). This means that even if rates do go up in the future you won't be paying a higher rate, which is a positive for you. You are buying the house to live in so as long as you can keep making the repayments you should not be too worried if the price of the house drops sometime in the future, because if your house has dropped and you want to sell to buy another house to live in, then that house would have also dropped relative to yours (give or take). So your main worry is that rates will go up causing both house prices to fall and unemployment to rise, and you yourself losing your job and eventually your house. It is a risk, but what you need to consider is if you can manage that risk. Firstly, I believe rates won't be going up in the US for a number of years, and if and when they do start going up they will most probably start going up slowly. So you have some time on your side. Secondly, what can you do between now and when interest rates do start going up in a few years: Try to put more saving away to increase your safety net from 6 months to 12 months or more, or make extra repayments into your home loan so that you are ahead if things do go wrong. If you are worried that you could lose your job, what can you do to reduce your chances of losing your job or increasing your chances of getting a new job quickly if you do lose it? Improve your current skills, get new skills, become an invaluable employee, or look at possible opportunities to start your own business. Do your own research on the types of houses you are looking at buying, the more houses you look at the better prepared you will be when the right house at the right price comes along, and the less chance that you will be rushed into buying what might be an overpriced house. So to sum it up; do as much research as you can, have an understanding of what your risks are and how you are going to manage those risks.""]",0,real,0.006955106,0,True

"How do we continue to make / discover new elements ? I have always been curious how Scientist can discover new elements and how they can make new elements ?

Every element on the periodic table is an atom with a specific number of protons . Versions of a specific element exist because they can have different numbers of neutrons . These versions are called "" isotopes "" . Every time scientists confirm that an atom has been created with a new number of protons , it is added to the table . All the potential elements up to 117 protons have been confirmed . New elements are made by smashing atoms together under very specific conditions . The results of these collisions are sometimes new atoms rather than just an exploded mass of neutrons and protons . You have to smash a lot of atoms together to have a chance to get a few potential candidates for "" new "" elements . The more protons an atom has the greater its "" atomic weight "" . Elements heavier than Uranium tend to be inherently unstable . The bizarre "" nuclear forces "" ( strong & weak ) which dominate the particle world of protons and neutrons are n\'t powerful enough to hold large atomic nuclei together and the nuclei spontaneously break apart . The heavier the atom , the more rapidly this disintegration happens . At the very edge of the periodic table the atoms only exist for a few instants . There are hints that at some point along this progression there may be a place where the various forces find a new equilibrium and very heavy atoms may be \' stable \' for longer periods of time , maybe even long enough to do something useful with chemically . But so far that is just a theory .', ""Atoms consist of three particles . Electrons which orbit the core , and neutrons and protons which make up the core .

Lead has 83 protons and gold has 79 . By removing three protons from a lead atom you turn it into gold , doing what alchemists of the old could n't . If we smash two really heavy atoms , in one case calcium and curium we can merge them into one humungous atom . Bigger atoms are generally more unstable than smaller ones , so these superheavy elements rarely survive longer than a tiny fraction of a second before bursting into other , smaller and more stable elements .

Once enough properties of a new element have been measured , and it has been proven to exist , a new element can be added to the table . The trick to this is that really big nuclei are unstable , no matter how many neutrons that you stick together , and these large atoms are very , very short lived before decaying .

If a developer notices that Richard Nixon is winning every test game , they might tone down Watergate .', ""> It seems like it would require a lot of math . Does it ? Yes . I 'm writing my doctoral thesis in comp sci on game development and balance is a big part of it . I ca n't tell you specifically what Firaxis does , but to some degree things can be a lot of math , which are well suited to ELI5 because well , the math depends on your combat model and that is game specific . But there are a lot of fairly profound design and philosophical choices . Should a phalanx unit be able to defend against a tank ? With what probability ? Math lets you tweak parameters to make whatever you want happen , but ultimately what the math should do is a design choice . When it comes to more orthogonal choices - like the faction bonuses , where one guy gets bonus money and another guy gets bonus diplomatic relations well , they are n't really balanced in any purely theoretical math sense . It 's not really realistic to try and weight 1 unit of money versus diplo reputation . The idea is to basically run the game a LOT , AI on AI , player on player , AI on player and figure out the probabilities of winning and losing . In a game like Civ where a lot of the game is AI factions against AI factions you can do a lot of balance by just automating the game and seeing how it goes , and keep going until a large enough sample sets gives you close to equal probabilities for each faction . Enter into the discussion : Starcraft . Starcraft is an esport rather than just a single player game . In this case your tolerances on advantages to a given faction are much lower than they are for something like Civ ( or the other extreme , Skyrim , where you can kill the last boss with about 3 hits if you are so inclined ) . Balance really works in multiple layers - units against units , collections of units from an era against other collections from an era ( say early game / late game , or ' ages ' in Civ ) , overall strategies that may encompass multiple eras against each other , and then all of the indirect ( non military ) systems balances against each other . Oh , and in Civ thinks are heavily biased by starting location and conditions , this is deliberate - in SC you 're trying to give everyone an equal chance , in a historical game you 're trying to give a realistic starting condition . In civ the randomness is part of what makes the fun of the game , and optimizing around random conditions , so each game is different . Edit : One thing to add . Sometimes good balance is about thinking outside the immediate set of equations around your combat and say ' lets add reload delay to this weapon , shrink the clip size , or to change how the scope works ' or the like and you get away from bullet damage and rates of fire as big overarching math concepts and change how players can actually use the tools given to them ."", ""It can vary a lot depending on the type of game but usually problems in balance are identified through extensive playtesting and/or collecting and analysing statistics , etc .

Here is a [ simple video game AI decision tree ] ( URL_0 ) . Frequently , there is a high degree of randomness in a decision tree , as you [ can see here ] ( URL_4 ) . It may be helpful to see a [ more complex decision tree example ] ( URL_1 ) . * * How can a machine react to human inputs intelligently ? * * Decision trees are just one type of simple AI . Games use a broad variety of techniques to make intelligent decisions . One interesting example from the many different AI systems is something called an [ artificial neural network ] ( URL_3 ) . A neural network is like a digital imitation of the human brain . It begins its "" life "" as a useless bunch of connections between input ( what is currently happening in the game ) and output ( the behavior of the AI character ) . These connections start out essentially randomly , and signals are sent through them from input to output . Between the inputs and outputs , there are hidden points ( nodes ) that require a certain level of input before they will continue a signal from the input side to the output side . For example , one input might be * speed * . Speed might connect to a node that requires 10 mph before it will continue the signal to an output . By changing the required value ( called * action potential * or * weight * ) of that node , you can change the behavior of the system . However , there are usually hundreds or thousands of nodes in a much more complex configuration . Instead of manually changing their weights , a programmer puts in * desired behavior * for a given situation and has the computer replay that situation over and over , changing the weights a little on each replay . The system keeps weights that get it closer to the desired behavior , and discards weights that move it away from desired behavior . In this way , after randomly changing its "" brain "" millions of times and seeing how each change impacts its behavior , the computer can be * trained * to be a good AI for a particular situation . Check out this [ video of a neural network AI learning how to drive ] ( URL_2 ) .

In [ tic - tac - toe ] ( URL_1 ) there is a board with nine squares and players take turns filling squares with a nought or a cross . The game ends when one player has three symbols in a row or the board is full . In the first scenario , that player wins and the second is a draw . Since tic - tac - toe is a relatively simple game , we can come up with some really good [ strategies ] ( URL_1 # Strategy ) and even make a [ diagram ] ( URL_0 ) for how to win . In this kind of situation , all you need to do is put the winning moves into the computer and let it follow instructions . But how does this work ? Well , for tic - tac - toe we might use a [ tree ] ( URL_2 ) . Trees are easy to make in today \'s [ object - oriented languages ] ( URL_3 ) like C # and Java . Here , the top of the tree represents the start of the game and you follow branches downwards from state to state as the game goes on . In the picture , the board starts empty and let \'s say the player places an X. The computer follows the branch to the appropriate state and from there it can look down subsequent branches to see what states can possibly come next . At the bottom of the tree will be all the possible end states for the game . Some of them will be kind of high up , where someone gets three in a row and some of them will be nine layers down where the board is full and it \'s a draw . So how do we use the tree to figure out winning moves ? There are , again a few ways you could do it but let \'s stick with the easiest example . Let \'s take a look at every possible \' end state \' in the tree and give it a value depending on whether or not it \'s a good outcome for us . We could put a \' 1 \' on every end state where we win , a \' -1 \' on every end state where we lose and a \' 0 \' on every end state where it \'s a draw . Then all we need to do is say "" the value of any particular state is determined by summing the value of all the states that could come next "" . Let \'s imagine we \'re looking at a state where there are two possible next moves , one where we win and one where it \'s a draw . The win is worth 1 point and the draw is worth zero so the total value of the current state is 1 . We can do this all the way back up the tree until every state of the game has an appropriate point value . Then , when we want to choose our next move , all we have to do is pick the one that has the most points because that \'s the one which has the most chance of ending in a win for us ! Of course , this strategy does n\'t work so well for complex games like chess because there is such a wide variety of moves that the tree gets really big , really quickly - too big for current computers to handle . In that kind of situation we might combine a few different AI strategies and hope for the best . For instance , we could program the computer with some preset opening gambits , some preset endgame strategies and use our tree idea to simulate the mid - game as well as possible , filling in the blanks with our best guess at how much a branch is worth . We can cover the start and end pretty thoroughly because we have more solid facts about them ; at the start everyone has most of their pieces and there are only a few places they can be while at the end people might only have a few pieces to worry about and that simplifies things a lot . The middle is tricky because we ca n\'t really get a good idea of how to weigh short term gains against long term gains because we ca n\'t model every possibility but we might be able to make some educated guesses by estimating the value of the pieces in play and the value of their positions on the board .

Whenever the engine spins the flywheel does too . The pressure plate is then bolted directly onto the flywheel . Trapped inbetween them , but not bolted to either , is the clutch disc . Inside the pressure plate there \'s a "" pressure disc "" and some form of spring . Normally , the spring presses the pressure disc against the clutch disc .

How do you quantify investment risk?,"[""I use two measures to define investment risk: What's the longest period of time over which this investment has had negative returns? What's the worst-case fall in the value of this investment (peak to trough)? I find that the former works best for long-term investments, like retirement. As a concrete example, I have most of my retirement money in equity, since the Sensex has had zero returns over as long as a decade. Since my investment time-frame is longer, equity is risk-free, by this measure. For short-term investments, like money put aside to buy a car next year, the second measure works better. For this purpose, I might choose a debt fund that isn't the safest, and has had a worst-case 8% loss over the past decade. I can afford that loss, putting in more money from my pocket to buy the car, if needed. So, I might choose this fund for this purpose, taking a slight risk to earn higher return. In any case, how much money I need for a car can only be a rough guess, so having 8% less than originally planned may turn out to be enough. Or it may turn out that the entire amount originally planned for is insufficient, in which case a further 8% shortfall may not be a big deal. These two measures I've defined are simple to explain and understand, unlike academic stuff like beta, standard deviation, information ratio or other mumbo-jumbo. And they are simple to apply to a practical problem, as I've illustrated with the two examples above. On the other hand, if someone tells me that the standard deviation of a mutual fund is 15%, I'll have no idea what that means, or how to apply that to my financial situation. All this suffers from the problem of being limited to historical data, and the future may not be like the past.

How does Time Dilation work ? How is it that actual time elapsed for the same event can be different for different observers traveling at different speeds ? Explain like I'm five.,"['The answer to this question is a bit complicated but can be understood by anyone . First you need a few assumptions : * The speed of light is the same for all reference frames . Another way of saying that is no matter what you are looking at you always measure the speed of light the same . * You are always not moving in your own reference frame . Another way of saying it is , if you are in a car looking out the window it means exactly the same thing to say "" you and the car are moving down the road "" and "" the road is moving below you . "" One more thing . You need to know how clocks work . Since the one thing that is always the same is the speed of light , the simplest clock is a light clock . It is a flashlight / sensor ( FS ) and a mirror ( _ ) FS _ _ The flashlight makes a flash of light . The light bounces off the mirror and then hits the sensor . That is one tick . Each second is just a certain number of ticks . FS || || _ || _ If you hold a clock and look at it you would see the light taking a path straight up and down . Now let \'s think what someone else would see if they looked at your clock while you drive down the high way . The flashlight / sensor would n\'t be in the same place when they made the flash as when it bounced back so to them it would look more like this . car moving this way - > F S \\ / \\ / _ _ \\/ _ _ Notice that instead of going straight up and down the light had to go diagonal . \\ is a longer path than | . Since the speed of light is always the same and the light when a longer distance , it must have taken more time . For the person looking at your light clock each tick takes a longer time . Their own clock records more ticks in a second then yours does . Now this does n\'t happen to you . You are always at rest in your frame so the light is still bouncing straight up and down for you . You have no reason to think that your clock is running slowly . In fact . If you look out the windows at the other person \'s clock you see them standing on the side of the road moving backwards . Their clock runs slowly for exactly the same reason . Time goes slower for people outside of your own frame because light has to travel a longer distance .', 'There are many different ways of explaining this , or trying to , but basically it \'s hard to understand because we are n\'t able to step back from our universe and look at it from the right perspective . Time dilation is a fact -- it must be happening , and in fact it has actually been measured . Not only that , but our GPS systems have to take time dilation into account , otherwise they would n\'t work properly . The difficulty started when scientists built some equipment to accurately measure the speed of light . They were trying to settle a completely different argument ( whether ether exists , to be exact ) and needed to measure the speed of sunlight . Their idea was that if you measured the speed of light from the sun in one direction , then turned the equipment round and measured it in the other direction , then difference between the measured speed would provide the answer to the "" ether "" question . Unfortunately , the measured the speed of light as being exactly the same , which was stupid , and they thought they must have made a mistake . Even if the ether did n\'t exist ( and it does n\'t , by the way ) , the rotation of the earth should show up as a difference in the measured speed of light . But it does n\'t , and not until later , when Einstein applied his brain to the problem , was a solution proposed : take Newton \'s theories about the universe , but tweak them slightly , using geometry instead of forces to explain them , and you have your answer : it does n\'t matter how fast you \'re moving , a beam of light will always travel at the speed of light -- "" c "" -- relative to you , and at the same time relative to everyone else in the entire universe . Now , imagine a spaceship with a headlight . The ship zooms past you , and you clock its speed at one half the speed of light -- 0.5c . As it passes you , it switches on its headlight . How fast does the light from the headlight travel ? Well , you measure the speed at c , twice as fast as the ship . After one second has elapsed , the beam of light has reached 186,000 miles , while the ship is at 93,000 miles . This means that the beam of light is now the same distance , 93,000 miles , ahead of the ship . But the captain of the ship also measures the speed of the light at c relative to him . To him , after one second , the light is 186,000 miles away from where he is . If he adds the distance the light has travelled -- 186,000 miles -- to the distance the ship has travelled -- 93,000 -- he will conclude that the light is travelling at 279,000 miles per second : but that \'s impossible , because our universe wo n\'t allow light ( or anything else ) to travel at that speed . And he does see the light leaping ahead 186,000 miles a second faster than the ship is moving . This has been measured : this was that experiment , measuring the light from the sun , that started this whole thing off . So after one second , the two of you disagree on how far the light has travelled . There \'s only one possible explanation : you are experiencing time moving at different speeds . It \'s obvious : speed is distance divided by time , so if the speed is the same for you both but the distance is different , then the time must also be different .', 'If you travel really fast you go into the future .']",0,real,0.005853517,0,True

Explain like I'm five.","['In short , your mouse and monitor do n\'t communicate directly with each other ... The graphics chip in your computer sends data to your monitor to tell it what to display . The monitor does n\'t really process any of this , it just uses the data to decide what colour each pixel should be . Your mouse does the opposite . When you move it or click the buttons , it generates signals which are sent to your computer . The mouse itself does n\'t know where it is on the screen , or whether it is clicking an icon , or how far or fast it is moving - it just knows "" I \'m moving left "" , or "" My left button was clicked "" . It \'s the computer \'s job - primarily the Operating System - to decide what to do with the mouse information . It will use the data to decide where the mouse is on the screen , and will incorporate that data into what is being sent to the monitor . So really , the monitor and the mouse have very little to do with each other . One takes input and gives it to the computer , the other takes output from the computer and displays it to the user .', 'You left you the all - important middle man that makes the entire thing possible : The computer itself . The computer draws the image , called a user interface , on the monitor by telling it which pixel ( tiny dots that make up your screen ) should be which color . Different parts of the image are associated with additional programming code that make them interactive when the user clicks on them or what have you . The positions of these things are tracked like things on that coordinate plane from Math Class ( X and Y axes representing sideways and up - down ) . All of this is done by the computer . The mouse sends movement information and button press information to the computer . The mouse moves in two axes interpreted as X and Y. It is worth noting that the mouse DOES NOT tell the computer what its position is . The mouse does not know where it is in relation to the screen ( if you pick up your mouse and move it , save for little hicks caused by lateral movement of the mouse while you pick it up and set it down triggering the movement detection , the cursor will not follow your movements nor "" snap "" to a spot on the screen ) . Instead , the mouse tells the computer "" I am moving along the X axis at velocity A and the Y axis at velocity B. "" The computer represents this with the cursor . It \'s position , however , is entirely controlled by the computer . If the cursor is sitting at ( 0,0 ) , and the computer receives "" Mouse moving X at 1 dot / ms and Y at 5 dots / ms "" for 10 ms , then the computer moves the cursor in that direction and velocity derived from that data until stopping at ( 10,50 ) 10 ms later . ( I pulled those numbers out of my ass , so they may be unrealistic , but the principle is the same ) The monitor displays this because the computer is constantly sending information telling it which pixels should be which color .

How do nukes work ? I know that inside the missile / shell there is radioactive material but how does it create the massive explosion when the missile hits the ground ? Please explain like I'm five.,"[""There are two types of nuclear weapon , each with a number of different designs . The two main types are fission weapons ( sometimes called atom bombs ) and fusion weapons ( sometimes known as [ thermonuclear weapons ] ( URL_1 ) ) . Both of these devices rely on the special theory of relativity to work . In short , special relativity shows that [ matter and energy are interchangeable ] ( URL_0 ) , and it is possible to free up some of the energy stored as mass . Fission weapons work by splitting atoms . Certain types of atom ( usually Plutonium or [ Uranium ] ( URL_3 ) ) , when given the right conditions , undergo a chain reaction of splitting apart . The mass of the bits it splits into is less than the original mass - some of that mass has been directly converted into energy . For the chain reaction to get going , there needs to be a certain amount of fuel there , called the [ critical mass ] ( URL_4 ) . In fission bombs , two methods are used to make the critical mass . The first method is the gun design , which uses a conventional explosive to ram two pieces of nuclear fuel together .

"How do modern mercenaries operate ? It sounds like something illegal to me , but they do exist . How do mercenary organisations form , where do they come from and how are they hired ? Explain like I'm five. ","[""Ha , something I can answer , my thesis for my bachelor of political science is completely on Dutch private military companies . In the current scientific terminology mercenaries are actually defined as contractors , calling them mercenaries was considered pretty old fashioned by the private military company directors I interviewed . Contractors are defined as military personnel that do not work directly for a government but for a company . A lot of states , especially the US , have started to use these companies a lot over the last decades . In 2007 for example 54 % of US defense personnel in Afghanistan were contractors and not US state troops . Contractors are deployed in a myriad of ways , they fight shoulder to shoulder with American soldiers in the front line but also protect vips or convoys , protect the outer rings of camps or support armies in logistical ways by flying planes or helicopters with vital supplies . They also guard merchant vessels in for example the Gulf of Aden and they help companies that have to deal with kidnappings of personnel in Africa . Contractors have advantages over normal troops in some situations . They are often cheaper to deploy than army equivalents . You do not want elite troops guarding the outer rings of camps in low intensity areas , so it is preferable for states to hire cheap third country contractors to do these relatively simple tasks so that the regular troops do not have to waste their time on patrol duties and can do actual missions . There is some criticisms on this system as some argue that companies should not partake in the monopoly of the use of legal force . This monopoly is the idea that only the state can legally detain you or punish you using force . Now there are companies do basically the same . Fighting wars for states makes it legal for them to kill people sometimes largely to their own discretion . The academic and philosophical debate on whether companies should be allowed to partake in this monopoly on the use of legal force is still raging and something we will have to tackle in the coming decades as the use of private military companies is on the rise . I hope I gave a quick am understandable overview of what pmcs do , I am sadly not with my computer so I ca n't give references for my sources , but if you want to learn more about pmcs authors like Tonkin and Leander are great sources to learn more about this emerging issue ."", 'They are typically formed by ex - military or police officers and are hired just like any other company : you \'d sign a contract with them . Naturally , they do n\'t use the term "" mercenary "" preferring the more subtle term , "" security services . "" You would not hire these companies as an army to fight a war though . Typically they would be contracted for personal security and to train an existing group of men , turning them into soldiers . They would also offer strategic counsel and probably have sources for supplying arms .', ""Mercenaries are just companies that provide people who do work . Swiss mercenaries ( employed by the vatican in an official capacity to guard the pope ) are essentially an officially endorsed state sponsored mercenary arrangement . Nepalese Gurkhas who fight for the British army are something similar . But wholly private mercenaries basically grow out of some former soldier or someone with diplomatic and military connections who can hire people who are going to fight . Ghaddafi hired chadian mercenaries essentially straight out of want ads in , well , chad . Mark Thatcher ( son of former UK Prime minister Margaret ) got into the business through Simon Mann , a former British army officer who was contracted by the Angolan government to provide military services retaking an oil field . The legality of mercenaries is sort of all over the place . If the government of a country hires you to to do work for them , in their own country then presumably the work is by definition legal , at least in the sense that you took a contract you understood to be legal . Using a mercenary force against another country is n't at all obvious when it is or is n't legal . In the case of say , colonial efforts by the americans in Iraq , well , private contractors delivering supplies etc . need guards , so are those guys mercenaries ? ( Yes , but not necessarily ) . If you want to pay some French or Americans or whatever to come to your country and train your army that is presumably legal . But if you want to pay them to come and train your insurgent force to take over the country that usually is n't . Keep in mind that many countries , particularly in Africa and the Middle East have pathetically small armies , that have almost no equipment , no combat experience , no competent leadership , and generally ca n't be trusted to actually fight , or if they do , probably not win . Those countries rely on foreign specialists for their fighting and training needs because they ca n't be bothered to train their own forces for the relatively rare event that they need them . So long as they are fighting non sovereign states ( so pirates , gangs , insurgents , even ISIS ) mercenaries are generally desirable . The situation against ISIS is a fairly good example of why you might need mercenaries . If you do n't trust your own army to not defect , you have a problem ( Syria and Saudi have this problem ) . If you think your army is going to turn and run at the first sign of trouble you have a problem ( the Iraqi 's have this problem ) . If your army refuses to fight during Ramadan , you have a problem . Mercenaries let you overcome a lot of that . Also , Mercenaries , are essentially outside the geneva conventions , they are not considered combatants and not entitled to geneva convention protections explicitly . For that reason they have no motivation to adhere to geneva conventions , and if you intend to do something illegal some mercenaries are happy to torture and stage coups etc , because it ca n't get any worse for them if they are caught and taken prisoner .""]",0,real,0.0057450663,0,True

"How do things dry ? Let 's say I spill a glass of water on my wooden floor . After a while , it 's just not there anymore . Where does this water go ? Explain like I'm five.","['Sure! When you spill a glass of water on your floor, the water starts to spread out and cover more of the floor. The water molecules are very tiny and can move around easily. As the water touches the floor, it starts to evaporate, which means that the water turns from a liquid into a gas. When water evaporates, it turns into water vapor, which is a type of gas. The water vapor rises into the air and floats around until it finds something cold to touch. When it touches something cold, the water vapor turns back into a liquid and forms tiny droplets on the surface. This is called condensation. So, when you spill water on your floor and it disappears, it has actually just evaporated into the air and turned into water vapor. The water vapor has then risen up into the air and turned back into tiny droplets of water on the cold surface.']",1,fake,0.99345773,1,True

When light waves with these wavelengths bounce off an object and enter our eyes, they stimulate the cells in our retina and our brain perceives the color red.\n\nSo, in a way, the color red is actually red to our eyes, because that is how our eyes and brain perceive it.

How do dividends of the underlying security in a security futures contract affect the security futures price?,"[""When a company declares a dividend on its underlying stock, the price of the stock typically decreases by an amount equal to the dividend on the ex-dividend date, which is the date on which the stock begins trading without the dividend. This is because the dividend is paid out of the company's profits, and the value of the company's profits is reflected in the stock price.The price of a security futures contract is derived from the price of the underlying stock, so the dividend will also affect the price of the security futures contract. The value of the security futures contract is based on the value of the underlying stock minus the value of the dividend that will be paid out. Therefore, when the stock goes ex-dividend, the price of the security futures contract will typically decrease by an amount equal to the dividend.It's important to note that the effect of a dividend on the price of a security futures contract can be more complex than this simple explanation, as other factors such as supply and demand, market conditions, and the current level of interest rates can also affect the price of the contract.""]",1,fake,0.99368757,1,True

Computers store data using bits, which are units of information that can have one of two values: 0 or 1. When we group several bits together, we can represent different types of data, such as letters, numbers, and symbols. One way that computers can represent letters and numbers is by using a code called ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange). ASCII is a standard that assigns a unique number to each letter, number, and symbol in the English language. For example, the ASCII code for the letter ""A"" is 65, the ASCII code for the letter ""B"" is 66, and so on. So when a computer sees a binary code like 01100001, it knows that this code represents a letter because it has been programmed to recognize the ASCII codes for letters.

I\'ll do my best to explain how a computer works in a way that\'s easy to understand. A computer is a machine that can perform tasks, like storing and retrieving information, doing calculations, and communicating with other devices. At the heart of a computer is the central processing unit (CPU), which is the ""brain"" of the computer. It reads and executes instructions that tell the computer what to do. The instructions that the CPU follows are called programs. Programs are written in a special language called code, which is a set of instructions that the computer can understand and follow. The CPU reads the instructions in a program and carries them out by manipulating data. Data is information that a computer can use, like numbers, text, or pictures. The CPU can read data from storage devices, like a hard drive or a USB flash drive, and it can also receive data from other devices, like a keyboard or a mouse. The CPU stores data in its own memory, called RAM (random access memory). RAM is like a workspace where the CPU can access and manipulate data quickly. When the computer is turned off, the data in RAM is lost. The CPU also sends and receives data to and from other parts of the computer, like the display, which is the screen you see, and the speakers, which produce sound. The CPU sends the data to these devices through wires called cables, which are connected to the motherboard (the main circuit board inside the computer).

"How do you text in Chinese ? To my understanding , the Chinese language is composed of complex characters that usually represent words . So how do you text with a language on a limited keyboard ? Please explain like I'm five.","['Great question! Chinese characters are indeed quite complex, and there are thousands of them. However, it is possible to text in Chinese using a limited keyboard, such as the one on a phone or computer. One way to do this is through the use of pinyin, which is a system for transliterating Chinese characters into the Roman alphabet. Pinyin uses letters like ""b,"" ""p,"" and ""m"" to represent the sounds of Chinese syllables, so you can type out Chinese words by spelling them out phonetically in pinyin. For example, the Chinese word for ""hello"" (ä½ å¥½) can be typed out as ""nÇ hÇo"" in pinyin. Another way to text in Chinese is through the use of input methods, which are software programs that allow you to type Chinese characters using a combination of keystrokes. There are several different input methods available, each with its own set of rules for typing Chinese characters. Some input methods use a system called stroke order, which involves typing out the strokes that make up a character in a specific order. Others use a system called radical-stroke, which involves typing out the radicals (simplified forms of characters) and strokes that make up a character. Overall, there are many different ways to text in Chinese using a limited keyboard, and the method you choose will depend on your personal preference and the tools you have available.']",1,fake,0.99288166,1,True

How do railguns work ? I would like some clarity on the act of actual projectile being fired . Please explain like I'm five.,"[""Sure! A railgun is a type of gun that uses electricity to launch a projectile instead of gunpowder. It works by using two metal rails and a sliding armature to create a strong magnetic field. \nFirst, a very strong electrical current is passed through the rails. This creates a magnetic field that pushes against the armature, which is a conductive metal bar or rod that is mounted between the rails. When the magnetic field is strong enough, it can overcome the force of gravity and friction, causing the armature to slide along the rails at high speed. \nThe armature is connected to the projectile, which is a small metal object that is meant to be launched from the gun. As the armature slides along the rails, it carries the projectile with it, propelling it out of the railgun and through the air. \nThat's the basic idea, but there are a lot of technical details and engineering challenges involved in making a railgun work properly. Some railguns use additional components, such as a pulsed power supply or a plasma armature, to achieve even higher speeds and greater accuracy. \nI hope that helps!

Mass is a measure of the amount of matter in an object, and it is the same no matter where you are in the universe. Weight, on the other hand, is a measure of the force exerted on an object due to gravity. The weight of an object depends on its mass and the strength of the gravitational field it is in.Here's an example to help illustrate the difference between mass and weight: Imagine you have a bag of potatoes that weighs 10 pounds on Earth. If you took that same bag of potatoes to the moon, which has a weaker gravitational field than Earth, the bag of potatoes would weigh less than 10 pounds because the force of gravity on the moon is weaker than it is on Earth. However, the mass of the bag of potatoes would still be the same, regardless of whether it is on Earth or the moon.So to summarize, kilograms and pounds are both used to measure mass, but weight is a measure of the force exerted on an object due to gravity and depends on the mass of the object and the strength of the gravitational field it is in.""]",1,fake,0.99336773,1,True

How do whiskey companies deal with the fact that the product they make today gets sold to a market 15 years in the future ? How do you respond to shifts in demand with a latency of 15 + years for the maturation of your product ? Explain like I'm five.,"[""Whiskey companies have to plan ahead and anticipate changes in demand for their products. They do this by keeping track of trends in the market and trying to predict what people will want to drink in the future. To make sure they have enough whiskey to meet future demand, they might make more whiskey today than they think they will need right now. This extra whiskey will be stored in barrels and left to age for several years. The aging process is an important part of making whiskey. As the whiskey sits in the barrel, it takes on the flavors and characteristics of the wood. The longer it ages, the more complex and refined the flavor becomes. So, even if the demand for whiskey changes over time, the whiskey that has already been made will still be of high quality. It's also worth noting that different types of whiskey have different aging requirements. For example, Scotch whisky must be aged for at least three years in oak barrels, while Bourbon must be aged for at least two years.

Instead, the value of fiat money is derived from the faith and credit of the issuing government.\r\n\r\nTo determine the value of fiat money, we can consider a few different factors:\r\n\r\nSupply and demand: Like any other good or service, the value of fiat money is influenced by how much of it is available and how much people want to buy it. If there is more demand for a particular currency than there is supply, the value of that currency may increase.\r\n\r\nEconomic conditions: The value of a currency may also be influenced by the overall state of the economy. For example, a strong and growing economy may lead to an increase in the value of the currency, while a weak or struggling economy may lead to a decrease in value.\r\n\r\nInterest rates: The interest rate set by a government's central bank can also affect the value of a currency. If interest rates are high, people may be more likely to hold onto their currency, which can lead to an increase in value.\r\n\r\nPolitical stability: The stability and reliability of a government can also influence the value of its currency.

[ Example ] ( URL_0 ) Explain like I'm five.","[""Planes are able to fly sideways by using their rudder, which is a hinged surface located at the back of the plane's tail. The pilot can use the rudder to steer the plane left or right by turning it in the desired direction. When a plane is flying straight, the air flows smoothly over the wings from front to back. This creates lift, which is the upward force that keeps the plane in the air. But when a plane is flying sideways, the air doesn't flow smoothly over the wings. Instead, it hits the wings at an angle, which changes the way the lift is generated. Instead of lifting the plane straight up, the lift acts more like a sideways force that pushes the plane in the direction it's moving. Despite this, planes are still able to fly sideways because they are designed to be stable in the air. This means that they are able to maintain their balance and stay in the air even when they are flying at strange angles or in unusual conditions.

They are a type of energy that travels through the air and can be used to heat up food.\r\n\r\nInside a microwave, there is a special device called a magnetron that generates microwaves. When you turn on the microwave, the magnetron sends out microwaves, which travel through the air and into your food. The microwaves cause the water molecules in your food to vibrate, which creates heat.\r\n\r\nWhen you open the door of the microwave while it is still running, the microwaves stop being produced, so they can't heat up your food anymore. However, the heat that was already produced inside the food will continue to be distributed, so the food may still feel warm even after the microwaves have stopped.\r\n\r\nSo, in short, microwaves work by using special waves of energy to heat up food, and you can stop the microwaves from working by opening the door of the microwave.""]",1,fake,0.9925287,1,True

During this test, a small amount of an allergen (such as a substance that a person might be allergic to) is placed on the skin, and then a needle is used to prick the skin through the allergen. If the person is allergic to the allergen, they will develop a raised bump or rash on their skin. \nAnother way to test for allergies is to do a blood test. During this test, a blood sample is taken from the person and sent to a laboratory, where it is tested for the presence of antibodies to specific allergens. Antibodies are proteins produced by the body's immune system in response to an allergen. If the person has allergies, their blood will contain high levels of these antibodies. \nIt's important to note that doctors do not usually test for allergies by exposing a person to the allergen directly. This is because allergies can cause serious reactions, such as difficulty breathing or a drop in blood pressure, and it would be dangerous to intentionally trigger these reactions. Instead, doctors use safer methods, such as skin prick tests and blood tests, to test for allergies.""]",1,fake,0.99310863,1,True

It is made up of three layers of a special type of semiconductor material, which are sandwiched together to form a channel through which electricity can flow.\\n\\nThe first layer is called the base, the second layer is called the collector, and the third layer is called the emitter. When a small amount of electricity is applied to the base of the transistor, it allows a larger amount of electricity to flow through the collector and emitter.\\n\\nTransistors are important because they can be used to control the flow of electricity in a circuit, which makes it possible to build all kinds of electronic devices. They are the building blocks of modern technology because they are used in almost all electronic devices, from computers and smartphones to TVs and radios.\\n\\nTransistors are also very small and can be packed together in large numbers on a tiny chip, which makes it possible to build very complex electronic circuits in a small space.

How do fibre optic cables actually work ? The extent of my knowledge of fibre optic cables is simply that they carry light as forms of information . How is this information interpreted and how does it generally work ? Edit : Thanks for the responses guys ! Explain like I'm five. ,"['Sure! Fiber optic cables work by using thin strands of glass or plastic called ""optical fibers"" to transmit information. These optical fibers are very thin, about the width of a human hair, and they are surrounded by a protective coating.\\n\\nLight travels through the optical fibers by bouncing off the walls of the fiber. This is possible because the inside of the fiber is very smooth and the light waves do not get absorbed or scattered as they travel through it.\\n\\nTo transmit information, the fiber optic cable uses different colors of light, or different wavelengths of light, to represent different bits of information. For example, one color of light might represent a ""1"" and another color might represent a ""0"".\\n\\nAt each end of the fiber optic cable, there is a device called a ""transmitter"" that converts electronic signals (like the ones your computer sends) into light signals. The transmitter sends these light signals through the fiber optic cable to the receiver at the other end.\\n\\nThe receiver at the other end of the fiber optic cable then converts the light signals back into electronic signals that can be understood by other devices, like a computer or a television.\\n\\nDoes that help explain how fiber optic cables work?

How do planes / subs know when missiles have a ' lock ' ?

When a missile ""locks"" onto a target, it means that it has identified the target and is tracking it using one or more of these sensors.For example, a missile might use radar to detect and track an airplane. The radar system sends out a beam of radio waves, which bounces off the airplane and returns to the missile. By measuring the time it takes for the waves to bounce back, the missile can determine the distance to the airplane and use this information to guide itself towards the target.In the case of a submarine, a missile might use sonar (which is like radar but uses sound waves instead of radio waves) to detect and track the submarine. The missile sends out a pulse of sound and listens for the echoes that bounce back when the sound waves hit the submarine.I hope that helps to explain it!']",1,fake,0.9929838,1,True
"How do geosynchronous orbits occur without falling to earth ? My knowledge of an orbit is an object continually falling toward earth but going fast enough to cancel out earth 's curvature . So , how can geosynchronous orbits exist without the satellite falling to earth ? Explain like I'm five.","['Sure! Geosynchronous orbits are a type of orbit where a satellite orbits the Earth at the same speed that the Earth is turning. This means that the satellite stays in the same position above the Earth\'s surface at all times.\r\n\r\nTo understand how this works, it\'s helpful to think about how the Earth\'s gravity works. Gravity is what keeps objects stuck to the Earth\'s surface and what makes things fall down. The Earth\'s gravity also reaches out into space, and it pulls on satellites and other objects that are orbiting the Earth.\r\n\r\nIf a satellite is orbiting the Earth and it\'s moving too slowly, then the Earth\'s gravity will pull it down and it will fall back to the surface. But if the satellite is moving fast enough, it will be able to stay in orbit and keep going around and around the Earth. The speed that a satellite needs to go in order to stay in orbit is called the ""escape velocity.""\r\n\r\nFor a satellite to be in a geosynchronous orbit, it needs to be in a very specific spot in space and it needs to be moving at a very specific speed.

How do PH values actually work ? Why should ( for example ) going from ph7 to ph8 not to be considered an increase by 1 but an increase as an order of magnitude ? Hope my question makes sense . Explain like I'm five.,"['pH stands for ""potential of hydrogen"" and is a measure of the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of a solution. The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral.

How do Tariffs Work ? How do Tariffs Work ? Who pays the Tariff Tax ? What happens to countries that have Tariffs imposed against them ? Explain like I'm five.,"['Tariffs are taxes that are placed on imported goods. They are usually put in place by the government of a country in order to protect domestic industries and businesses. For example, if a country has a lot of car manufacturers, the government might put a tariff on imported cars in order to make them more expensive for people to buy. This would make domestic cars more competitive, because they would not be taxed as much.\n\nThe people who pay the tariff tax are the people who buy the imported goods. If a tariff is placed on a product that you want to buy, you will have to pay extra for it because of the tax. The money from the tariff goes to the government of the country that imposed it.\n\nCountries that have tariffs imposed against them may find it more difficult to sell their products in other countries. This is because the products they sell will be more expensive due to the tariffs, and people in the other country may be less likely to buy them. This can lead to a decrease in the amount of money that the country makes from exporting goods.']",1,fake,0.9931085,1,True
"How does "" splitting the atom "" create such a large and destructive explosion ? Does it come from all the energy stored in a single particle ? I have always wondered . Explain like I'm five.","['Splitting the atom refers to the process of breaking down the nucleus of an atom, which is the small, dense, positively charged center of an atom. Atoms are made up of protons and neutrons, which are held together by a very strong force called the ""strong nuclear force."" When an atom is split, the strong nuclear force that holds its protons and neutrons together is also broken.\r\n\r\nThe energy that is released when an atom is split is called nuclear energy. This energy is released because the protons and neutrons that make up the nucleus of the atom are held together by a very strong force, and breaking that force requires a lot of energy. When the nucleus is split, the energy that was used to hold it together is released, and this energy is what causes the explosion.\r\n\r\nThe explosion from splitting the atom can be very large and destructive because the energy released is so enormous. In fact, the energy released from splitting just one atom is about a million times greater than the energy released from burning one molecule of gasoline.\r\n\r\nI hope that helps to explain it!

How do we really know 1 + 1 = 2 Straightforward . Did any mathematician or scientist ever prove this ? And How ? Please explain like I'm five.,"['One plus one equals two is a basic principle of mathematics that can be understood and demonstrated through simple counting. To prove that 1 + 1 = 2, we can start by counting objects. For example, if we have one apple and we add another apple, we have a total of two apples. We can also use blocks or other objects to demonstrate this concept. In mathematics, we use symbols to represent numbers and operations. The symbol ""+"" is used to represent the operation of addition, which means to combine or add two numbers together. So when we write the equation ""1 + 1 = 2,"" it means that if we add the numbers 1 and 1 together, the result is 2. This may seem like a simple and obvious fact, but it is actually a fundamental principle that underlies much of modern mathematics. It is a concept that is used as the basis for more complex mathematical operations and equations, and it is an essential building block for understanding higher mathematics.']",1,fake,0.9932111,1,True
How does a pool stay cool when it is in direct 95 + degree sun all day ? Could it have something to do with a thermocline maybe ? Please explain like I'm five.,"[""A pool can stay cool in hot weather by using a few different techniques. One way is to use a pool cover to block the sun's rays from directly hitting the water. This can help reduce the amount of heat absorbed by the water, which can help keep the water temperature lower. Another way to keep a pool cool is to use a pool pump and filter system to circulate the water. This helps to mix the cooler water from the bottom of the pool with the warmer water at the top, which can help even out the temperature of the water. A thermocline is a layer of water in a pool or lake that has a significant change in temperature. It is usually caused by the sun heating the top layer of water, which can create a temperature gradient between the top and bottom layers of water. In a pool, the thermocline is typically found near the middle of the pool and can create a distinct line where the water temperature changes. So, while a thermocline can help keep a pool cool by separating the warmer water at the top from the cooler water at the bottom, it is not the only factor that can help a pool stay cool in hot weather.

Explain like I'm five.","[""A Tesla car has an electric motor instead of a traditional gasoline engine. Instead of burning gasoline to create motion, the electric motor in a Tesla uses electricity from a set of batteries to power itself.\r\n\r\nOne of the main differences between a traditional gasoline engine and an electric motor is that the electric motor is much simpler and has fewer moving parts. Gasoline engines have many parts that move and work together, such as the pistons, crankshaft, and valves, which can wear out over time and require maintenance. Electric motors, on the other hand, have only one moving part (the rotor) and are generally more reliable and require less maintenance.\r\n\r\nAnother difference is that electric motors are much more efficient than gasoline engines. When a gasoline engine burns fuel, only a small percentage of the energy created is used to power the car. The rest is lost as heat and noise. Electric motors, on the other hand, can convert almost all of the electricity they receive into motion, making them much more efficient.\r\n\r\nOverall, electric motors are a cleaner and more efficient way to power a car compared to gasoline engines. They don't produce any emissions and require less maintenance, which makes them a good choice for people who want to reduce their impact on the environment and save money on fuel and maintenance costs.""]",1,fake,0.9937529,1,True

This is a process that happens in the center of the star, where the temperature and pressure are extremely high. In nuclear fusion, the hydrogen atoms combine to form helium atoms, and this releases a huge amount of energy in the form of light and heat. \nThis energy helps to hold the star up and keep it from collapsing in on itself.

Please explain like I'm five.,"['Herbivores like wild horses can acquire a lot of muscle mass by eating a lot of grass because grass contains a good amount of nutrients that the body needs to grow and maintain muscle mass. These nutrients include proteins, which are important for building and repairing muscle tissue, and carbohydrates, which provide the body with energy to support physical activity. \nIt is possible for a vegan human to maintain high muscle mass by eating a varied and balanced diet that includes a good source of plant-based proteins and carbohydrates. Some examples of plant-based proteins that can help build and maintain muscle mass include beans, lentils, tofu, tempeh, nuts, and seeds. It is also important for vegans to make sure they are getting enough calories and nutrients from other sources, such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, to support muscle growth and maintenance. \nHowever, it is generally easier for people who eat animal products, such as meat, eggs, and dairy, to get enough protein and other nutrients to support muscle mass because these sources of protein are typically more easily digestible and contain a more complete set of amino acids, which are the building blocks of protein. This does not mean that it is impossible for vegans to maintain high muscle mass, but it may require more careful planning and attention to nutrition.']",1,fake,0.9930635,1,True

PMI is meant to protect the lender in the event that the borrower defaults on their mortgage.To determine the equity requirement for PMI, lenders typically consider the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of the mortgage. The LTV ratio is calculated by dividing the loan amount by the value of the property. For example, if a borrower is seeking a mortgage of $200,000 to purchase a home with a value of $250,000, the LTV ratio would be 80% ($200,000 / $250,000).Lenders generally require PMI when the LTV ratio exceeds 80%. In this case, the borrower would be required to pay PMI until they have built up enough equity in the property to bring the LTV ratio down to 80% or lower. This can be achieved by making mortgage payments, which reduce the outstanding balance on the loan, or by the value of the property appreciating, which increases the value of the collateral for the loan.It's worth noting that some lenders may have different requirements for PMI, so it's always a good idea to check with the lender to confirm their specific policies.""]",1,fake,0.99374276,1,True

How do car engines work ? I have small background in thermodynamics so i think i can understand some terms . Please explain like I'm five.,"['Sure! A car engine is a machine that converts energy into motion. It does this by burning fuel (like gasoline) and using the energy from the resulting explosion to turn a crankshaft. Inside the engine, there is a cylinder with a piston inside it. The explosion pushes the piston down, causing the crankshaft to rotate. This rotation turns the wheels of the car, making it move. The process of burning fuel and turning the crankshaft is called the ""combustion cycle."" It starts when a spark plug sends a spark of electricity into the cylinder, which ignites the fuel and causes it to burn. As the fuel burns, it creates hot gases that push against the piston. The piston pushes back against the crankshaft, causing it to turn. When the crankshaft has turned a full 360 degrees, the combustion cycle is complete and it starts all over again. That\'s a very simplified explanation, but I hope it helps! Let me know if you have any questions.']",1,fake,0.99354833,1,True

It is widely used because it is a convenient and simple way to show the Earth on a flat surface. However, because the Earth is not a perfect sphere but rather an oblate spheroid (a sphere that is slightly flattened at the poles and bulging at the equator), the Mercator projection distorts the size of land masses as you move away from the equator. This means that countries near the poles (such as Canada and Russia) appear larger on a Mercator map than they really are, while countries near the equator (such as Brazil and Indonesia) appear smaller than they really are.To account for this distortion, Google Maps provides an option to switch to a different map projection called the ""Gall-Peters projection,"" which shows the size of land masses more accurately.

"How does ROUND - UP work and why is it bad ? I know it 's an herbicide , but I 'd like to know how it works to kill plants . Also , what does it do to humans ? Please explain like I'm five.","[""Roundup is a herbicide that is used to kill weeds and other unwanted plants. It works by interfering with a plant's ability to produce certain proteins that are necessary for its growth and survival. When a plant is sprayed with Roundup, the active ingredient in the herbicide, glyphosate, is absorbed by the plant and disrupts the production of these proteins. This causes the plant to stop growing and eventually die.Roundup is considered bad for several reasons. One reason is that it can be harmful to humans if it is ingested or comes into contact with the skin. Glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup, has been classified as a probable human carcinogen by the World Health Organization. This means that it may cause cancer in humans, although more research is needed to confirm this.Another reason why Roundup is considered bad is that it can be harmful to the environment. When Roundup is sprayed on plants, it can drift through the air and come into contact with other plants or animals. This can have negative effects on non-target plants and animals that are not intended to be killed by the herbicide. Additionally, Roundup can persist in the environment for a long time and can accumulate in soil, water, and other places, which can have negative impacts on the ecosystems around it.In summary, Roundup is a herbicide that is used to kill weeds and other unwanted plants. It works by disrupting the production of proteins that are necessary for the plant's growth and survival.

While rabies is a serious and often fatal disease, not all animals that are infected with the virus will become sick or die from it. This is because some animals are able to develop immunity to the virus and are able to survive the infection.Rabies is a virus that affects the central nervous system of animals. It is most commonly transmitted through the bite of an infected animal, but it can also be transmitted through scratches or abrasions. When an animal is bitten by another animal that has rabies, the virus can be transmitted through the saliva of the infected animal and enter the body of the animal that was bitten.Once the virus enters the body, it begins to multiply and spread to other parts of the body, including the brain and spinal cord. This can cause symptoms such as fever, weakness, and difficulty swallowing. If left untreated, rabies can be fatal.However, not all animals that are infected with rabies will develop symptoms or die from the disease. Some animals are able to develop immunity to the virus and are able to survive the infection.

"How do schools justify limiting free speech ? I know there have been tons of supreme court cases with students suing their schools because they violate free speech , but the schools always win . How do they keep winning ? Explain like I'm five.","['There are several reasons why schools may limit free speech, and these limits are generally considered to be acceptable under the law. First, it\'s important to understand that the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects the right to free speech, but this protection is not absolute. The Supreme Court has recognized that there are certain circumstances where the government (including schools, which are a part of the government) can regulate or limit speech without violating the First Amendment. One of these circumstances is when the speech in question causes a ""substantial disruption"" to the operation of the school. For example, if a student makes a speech during class that is so disruptive that it interferes with other students\' ability to learn, the school may be justified in limiting that speech. Another reason why schools may limit free speech is to ensure that all students have an equal opportunity to learn. For example, if a student is making racist or sexist comments that are disrupting the classroom environment and making it difficult for other students to focus, the school may be justified in limiting that speech. Finally, schools also have a responsibility to maintain a safe and orderly environment. If a student\'s speech is threatening or violent, the school may be justified in limiting that speech in order to protect the safety of other students. So, to summarize, schools can limit free speech if the speech causes a substantial disruption to the operation of the school, if it interferes with other students\' ability to learn, or if it threatens the safety of the school community.']",1,fake,0.99381727,1,True

How does GPS work ? How does it know where you are ? Edit : Thanks for the replies now I understand how it works . Explain like I'm five.,"[""GPS, or Global Positioning System, is a satellite-based navigation system that helps determine the location, speed, and direction of objects on Earth. It works by using a network of satellites orbiting the Earth to send signals to GPS receivers on the ground. These receivers pick up the signals and use them to calculate the receiver's location, speed, and direction. Here's how it works: GPS satellites orbit the Earth and constantly send signals down to the ground. A GPS receiver, like the one in your phone or car, picks up these signals. The receiver uses the signals to determine how far away it is from each satellite. It does this by measuring the time it takes for the signal to reach the receiver. Once the receiver knows how far away it is from at least four satellites, it can use this information to calculate its exact location on Earth. It does this by using a process called trilateration, which is a fancy way of saying that it measures the distance from the receiver to each satellite and uses this information to figure out where the receiver is. The receiver can also use the signals from the satellites to determine its speed and direction. It does this by measuring how fast the signals are changing and using this information to calculate how fast the receiver is moving.

As the app listens, it breaks the audio down into tiny pieces called ""features,"" which are like small pieces of the puzzle that make up the song.\n\nThese features are then compared to a database of songs to see if there is a match.

There are different types of oil rigs, but the ones you see in empty fields are usually called ""land rigs."" These rigs have a tall metal structure that sits on the ground, with a big drill bit at the bottom that can dig deep into the earth.\\n\\nTo start drilling, workers first have to find a place where they think there might be oil or natural gas. They use special tools and equipment to test the ground and see if there are any deposits of these substances. If they think there is oil or natural gas in a certain area, they will set up a land rig on that spot.\\n\\nThe land rig has a long pipe called a ""drill string"" that is attached to the drill bit at the bottom. The drill string is made up of many smaller pipes that fit inside each other. To start drilling, the workers use a big engine to turn the drill bit at the bottom of the drill string. The drill bit is made of very hard material, like diamonds or tungsten, and it can cut through the rock and soil as it turns.\\n\\nAs the drill bit digs deeper into the ground, the workers use the engine to raise and lower the rig. This helps them control how deep they are drilling, and it also helps them bring the drill bit back up to the surface when they need to change it or fix it.\\n\\nOnce the drill bit has dug deep enough, the workers will start pumping a special mixture of water, sand, and chemicals down the drill string.

Explain like I'm five.","[""Encryption is a way of encoding information so that it can't be read by people who don't have the right key to unlock it. A one-way encryption is designed to be irreversible, which means that once the information has been encrypted, it can't be turned back into its original form. The reason that one-way encryption is irreversible is because of the way it works. When you encrypt something, you use a special algorithm (a set of steps) and a key to turn the information into a scrambled, unreadable form. The key is like a secret code that only someone with the right password can use to unlock the information. One-way encryption algorithms are designed to be very complex and hard to reverse. This means that even if someone knows how the algorithm works, it would be very difficult for them to figure out how to turn the encrypted information back into its original form. This makes it much harder for someone to steal or misuse the information. So, to sum it up, one-way encryption is irreversible because it uses complex algorithms and keys to turn information into a scrambled, unreadable form that can't easily be turned back into its original form.""]",1,fake,0.9925056,1,True
How do trees create oxygen when they 've lost all their leaves in winter ? How do they do it ? Please explain like I'm five.,"[""Trees create oxygen through a process called photosynthesis, which occurs in their leaves. During photosynthesis, trees take in carbon dioxide from the air and use energy from sunlight to convert it into glucose (a type of sugar). Oxygen is a byproduct of this process, and it is released into the air as a waste product.In the winter, when trees have lost their leaves, they are not able to photosynthesize and produce oxygen in the same way as they do during the growing season. However, trees are still able to produce a small amount of oxygen through a process called respiration, which occurs in all living cells. During respiration, trees and other plants take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide, just like animals do.So even though trees don't produce as much oxygen in the winter as they do during the growing season, they are still able to produce some oxygen through respiration.

How do fridges work ? How can energy be used to make something colder than it 's surroundings ? It 's been bothering me for a solid five minutes . Explain like I'm five.,"['Fridges work by using a cooling system to make the inside of the fridge colder than the outside air. Inside the fridge, there is a gas called a refrigerant that flows through a system of tubes. When the refrigerant is pumped through the tubes, it absorbs heat from the air inside the fridge. This process cools down the air inside the fridge. The refrigerant then travels to a compressor, which is a kind of pump. The compressor squeezes the refrigerant, which makes it hot. The hot refrigerant is then sent to a set of coils on the back of the fridge. These coils are called the condenser coils. When the hot refrigerant passes through the condenser coils, it releases the heat it absorbed from inside the fridge into the air outside the fridge. This process cools down the refrigerant, so it can be pumped back into the fridge to absorb more heat and keep the inside of the fridge cold. So, in short, the fridge uses energy (usually from electricity) to run the compressor and pump the refrigerant through the cooling system. This helps to remove heat from the inside of the fridge and keep it cold.']",1,fake,0.99275744,1,True

How do small businesses survive against big ones . E.g. how do small fast food restaurants compete with places such as mcdonalds . Explain like I'm five.,"[""Small businesses can survive against big ones in a few different ways. One way is by offering something that the big businesses don't. For example, a small fast food restaurant might make all of their food from scratch, using fresh ingredients, while a big chain like McDonald's might use more processed ingredients. Customers who are looking for healthier or more high-quality food might choose the small restaurant over McDonald's.\r\n\r\nAnother way that small businesses can compete is by offering a more personalized experience. For example, a small fast food restaurant might get to know their regular customers and offer them special deals or personalized service. This can make the small business feel like a more welcoming and friendly place to eat, which can be a big advantage over a big chain restaurant.\r\n\r\nFinally, small businesses can also try to compete by being more convenient or easier to access than big businesses. For example, a small fast food restaurant might be located in a part of town where there aren't any big chain restaurants, so it's the only option for people in that area. Or, a small business might offer delivery or online ordering, which can be more convenient than going to a big chain restaurant.""]",1,fake,0.9937371,1,True

Then they make a special version of that germ that is either very weak or has been killed entirely. This special version of the germ is what goes into the vaccine. When we get a vaccine, our bodies think that the special germ in the vaccine is the real thing, so our immune system starts to fight it off. While it's fighting off the fake germ, our immune system also learns how to fight off the real germ. That way, if we ever come into contact with the real germ, our immune system will be ready to fight it off and we won't get sick.

Clocks in different time zones stay synchronized by using something called Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). This is a time standard that is used all around the world and it is based on the Earth's rotation.\n\nWhen it is noon in UTC, it is also noon in all of the other time zones around the world. However, since the Earth is round, different parts of the Earth are facing the Sun at different times. That's why we have different time zones. For example, when it is noon in UTC, it might be 7:00 AM in New York (which is in the Eastern Time Zone) because the Sun is just starting to rise there.\n\nTo keep all of the clocks in the world synchronized, we use something called a time signal. This is a special radio signal that is sent out from a very accurate clock, called a time standard. The time standard is a very accurate clock that is kept in a special place where the temperature and other conditions are kept very stable. This helps the clock stay accurate.\n\nMost regular clocks, like the one on your phone or the one on your wall, are accurate to within a few seconds. Some clocks are even more accurate and can keep time to within a fraction of a second. However, no clock is perfect and they all lose or gain a little bit of time over time.

"How do scientists delete or manipulate genes ? So researcher X maps or sequences a genome . Great . How do scientists identify and "" knockout "" genes for future study ? Explain like I'm five.","['Scientists use a variety of techniques to delete or manipulate genes in order to study their function. One common technique is called ""gene knockdown,"" which involves using small pieces of RNA to block the expression of a specific gene. Another technique is called ""gene knockout,"" which involves using genetic engineering techniques to permanently delete a gene from an organism\'s genome.\n\nOne way to do this is through a process called CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. CRISPR stands for ""Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats,"" and Cas9 stands for ""CRISPR-associated protein 9."" Essentially, CRISPR/Cas9 is a tool that scientists can use to make very precise cuts in DNA at specific locations. By using this tool, scientists can delete, replace, or add new DNA sequences to an organism\'s genome.\n\nTo use CRISPR/Cas9, scientists first need to identify the specific gene they want to manipulate. They can do this by looking at the genome sequence of the organism they are studying and searching for the specific sequence of DNA that corresponds to the gene they are interested in. Once they have identified the gene, they can use CRISPR/Cas9 to make precise cuts in the DNA at the locations where the gene is found. These cuts can then be used to delete or manipulate the gene as desired.\n\nOverall, scientists use a variety of techniques to delete or manipulate genes in order to study their function and understand how they contribute to the development and function of an organism.']",1,fake,0.992515,1,True

The energy in ATP comes from the third bond between the second and third phosphate groups. When this bond is broken, energy is released and can be used by the cell. One way that ATP gives energy to our cells is through the sodium-potassium pump. This is a protein that moves sodium ions out of cells and potassium ions into cells. It uses energy from ATP to do this. When the sodium-potassium pump is active, it uses up ATP molecules and releases the energy stored in them to power the movement of the ions. So, to summarize, ATP stores energy in its bonds and releases it when those bonds are broken. This energy can be used by our cells to power various processes, such as the sodium-potassium pump.']",1,fake,0.9929026,1,True

The stage of the illness: The further along an illness is, the more advanced it is and the more difficult it may be to treat. 3. The patient's overall health: If a patient has other health conditions or is in poor physical shape, they may not have as much time left as someone who is otherwise healthy. 4. The patient's response to treatment: Some patients may respond well to treatment and live longer than expected, while others may not respond as well and have a shorter prognosis. To determine how long a terminally ill patient has to live, doctors will consider all of these factors and use their medical knowledge and experience to make an educated estimate.

When a sacrificial metal is placed in contact with another metal, it will corrode before the other metal does, thereby protecting the other metal from corrosion.\n\nFor example, zinc is often used as a sacrificial metal on ships. When zinc is placed in contact with steel (which is a common material used in ship construction), it will corrode before the steel does. This is because zinc is more reactive than steel, meaning it is more prone to corrosion.\n\nHere\'s an example of how this works:\n\nImagine you have two pieces of metal - one is made of zinc and the other is made of steel. If you put them both in a solution that can cause them to corrode (such as saltwater), the zinc will start to corrode before the steel does. This is because the zinc is more reactive and will therefore be more affected by the solution.\n\nAs the zinc corrodes, it forms a layer of zinc oxide on its surface. This layer of zinc oxide acts as a barrier, protecting the steel from the corrosive solution.

I understand how we figure the real distance of closer bodies , but how do we know a quasar is 30 million light years away , or that Andromeda is 2.5 million light years away ? Please explain like I'm five.","['There are a few ways that we can determine the distance to stars and other objects in the universe. One way is by using something called parallax. Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of an object against the background when viewed from different angles. For example, if you hold your finger up in front of you and close one eye, then open that eye and close the other eye, your finger will appear to move against the background. This is because you are looking at it from two different angles. We can use this same principle to determine the distance to nearby stars. By measuring the apparent shift in the position of a star against the background of more distant stars (as viewed from opposite sides of Earth\'s orbit around the sun), we can calculate how far away the star is. This method is most accurate for stars that are relatively close to us (within a few hundred light-years). For more distant objects, such as quasars and galaxies, we use other methods to determine their distance. One such method is called the cosmic distance ladder, which involves using a series of ""rungs"" or steps to measure the distance to increasingly distant objects. Each rung of the ladder relies on a different type of ""standard candle,"" which is an object that is known to have a certain intrinsic brightness. By measuring the brightness of the object as seen from Earth, we can determine its distance. For example, one type of standard candle that we use is a type of star called a Cepheid variable. These stars have a very regular pulse, and the time between pulses is directly related to the star\'s intrinsic brightness. By measuring the time between pulses, we can determine the star\'s brightness, and therefore its distance. Once we have determined the distance to a Cepheid variable, we can use it as a ""rung"" on the cosmic distance ladder to measure the distance to other objects that are farther away. For example, we can use Cepheid variables to measure the distance to nearby galaxies, and then use those galaxies as ""rungs"" to measure the distance to even more distant galaxies. This way, we can build up a ""ladder"" of distances that reaches all the way out to the most distant objects in the universe.']",1,fake,0.99370307,1,True

How do speakers virtually produce any sound ? From my understanding speakers are made up of some vibrating cone of a fixed shape . It just seems to me that such a thing could only produce one sound like a drum . Explain like I'm five.,"['Speakers work by converting an electrical signal into sound waves that we can hear. Inside a speaker, there is a coil of wire called the voice coil, which is attached to a cone-shaped diaphragm. When an electrical current is passed through the voice coil, it creates a magnetic field. This magnetic field causes the voice coil and the attached diaphragm to move back and forth very quickly, creating vibrations. These vibrations cause the air around the speaker to vibrate as well, creating sound waves that we can hear. The shape of the cone-shaped diaphragm and the size of the speaker determine what kinds of sound waves it can produce. Different shapes and sizes of speakers are designed to produce different frequencies (or pitches) of sound. For example, a small speaker with a thin, lightweight diaphragm might be good at producing high-pitched sounds, like a tweet or a chirp, while a larger speaker with a heavier diaphragm might be better at producing lower-pitched sounds, like a bass drum or a bass guitar.

This means that if two people live near each other and interact frequently, they may begin to adopt similar ways of speaking. \nSecond, people who move to a new place may adopt the accent or dialect of the people they live and interact with. This is especially true for people who move to a new place during their formative years, when they are still learning how to speak. \nFinally, media and technology have made it easier for people to hear and learn about different accents and dialects from all over the country. This means that someone who grows up in the Midwest may be exposed to the way people speak in the Northeast or West Coast, and vice versa. \nOverall, there are many factors that contribute to the similarities in accents and dialects that we see in different parts of the United States.""]",1,fake,0.9934196,1,True

How does a nuclear bomb work ? Splitting an atom means nothing to me Please explain like I'm five.,"['Sure! A nuclear bomb works by using a small amount of highly enriched uranium or plutonium, which are types of elements that are found in nature. These elements are special because they can be split, or ""fissioned,"" when struck by a neutron. When this happens, it releases a lot of energy and also creates more neutrons. When these neutrons hit other uranium or plutonium atoms, it causes a chain reaction, which means that one atom splitting can lead to many more atoms splitting, releasing even more energy. This chain reaction is what makes a nuclear bomb so powerful. It can release an enormous amount of energy in just a few seconds.

How does Yahoo finance adjust stock data for splits and dividends?,"[""When a company declares a stock split, it increases the number of shares outstanding by issuing more shares to existing shareholders. For example, if a company declares a 2-for-1 stock split, an investor who owns 100 shares before the split would own 200 shares after the split. The value of the investor's holdings in the company would remain the same, but the value of each individual share would be halved.To adjust stock data for a stock split, Yahoo Finance divides the historical price of the stock by the split ratio. For example, if a stock traded at $100 per share before a 2-for-1 split, the adjusted price would be $50 per share after the split.Dividends are payments made by a company to its shareholders, typically in the form of cash or additional shares of stock. When a company declares a dividend, it reduces the value of its stock by an amount equal to the dividend per share.To adjust stock data for dividends, Yahoo Finance subtracts the value of the dividend from the historical price of the stock. For example, if a stock traded at $100 per share and the company declared a $1 per share dividend, the adjusted price would be $99 per share.It's important to note that stock splits and dividends can have a significant impact on the historical price data of a stock.

There are several reasons why a company might choose to buy back its own shares.One reason is to increase the value of the remaining shares. When a company buys back its own shares, it is effectively saying that it believes the shares are undervalued. This can lead to an increase in the price of the remaining shares, as investors may see the buyback as a sign of confidence in the company.Another reason is to return value to shareholders. If a company has a large amount of cash on hand and no good investment opportunities, it may choose to buy back its own shares as a way to return some of that cash to shareholders. This can be an attractive option for shareholders, as they can receive a cash payout without having to sell their shares.There are several ways that a company can buy back its own shares. The most common method is to conduct a tender offer, in which the company offers to buy a certain number of shares at a fixed price. Shareholders can choose to sell their shares back to the company or hold onto them.

Explain like I'm five.,"[""Animals use a variety of methods to navigate and find their way back home, even if they are moved far away.\r\n\r\nOne way they do this is by using their senses, such as sight, smell, and hearing, to gather information about their surroundings. For example, a pigeon might use its sense of smell to identify familiar landmarks, or use its keen eyesight to recognize distinctive features of the landscape.\r\n\r\nAnother way animals navigate is by using the Earth's magnetic field. Many animals, including birds, fish, and some insects, have special cells in their bodies that can detect changes in the magnetic field, which helps them orient themselves and navigate in a particular direction.\r\n\r\nFinally, some animals use celestial cues, such as the sun or the stars, to help them navigate. For example, birds might use the position of the sun in the sky to determine which direction is north, and then use this information to fly back home.\r\n\r\nOverall, animals use a combination of their senses and natural navigation skills to find their way back home, even if they are moved far away.""]",1,fake,0.99250424,1,True

Since it is based on relatively simple math , and relatively simple science , on what basis do they reject it ? Please explain like I'm five.","[""Radiocarbon dating is a technique that uses the decay of carbon-14 to determine the age of organic materials, such as wood or bones. It is based on the fact that carbon-14 is constantly being created in the Earth's atmosphere through the interaction of cosmic rays with nitrogen atoms. When an organism dies, it stops taking in carbon-14, and the carbon-14 in its body begins to decay at a predictable rate. By measuring the amount of carbon-14 in a sample and comparing it to the known decay rate of carbon-14, scientists can determine how old the sample is. Young Earth creationists, who believe that the Earth is only a few thousand years old, may reject radiocarbon dating because it produces ages that are much older than this. They may argue that the decay rate of carbon-14 has changed over time, or that the sample has been contaminated with older carbon. However, these arguments are not supported by scientific evidence and are not widely accepted by the scientific community. It is important to note that radiocarbon dating is just one of many methods that scientists use to determine the age of materials. Other methods, such as potassium-argon dating and uranium-lead dating, have been developed to provide additional information about the age of materials and help scientists confirm the results of radiocarbon dating.""]",1,fake,0.99385965,1,True

The way that gravity affects the motion of objects is through the curvature of spacetime.Imagine that spacetime is like a stretchy fabric, like a rubber sheet. If you put a heavy object, like a bowling ball, on the fabric, it will cause the fabric to stretch and bend. If you roll a smaller object, like a marble, towards the bowling ball, the marble will be attracted to the bowling ball and will roll towards it, following the curve of the fabric.This is a simple way to understand how gravity can be thought of as a curvature of spacetime, rather than a force. In reality, the concept of spacetime is a bit more complicated, but the basic idea is the same.On the other hand, forces like electromagnetism do not cause objects to curve through spacetime. Instead, they act directly on the objects themselves, causing them to accelerate or change direction. For example, when you rub a balloon against your hair, the electrons in your hair are attracted to the balloon, causing an electrostatic force that makes your hair stand up.

In other words, the digits of pi are ""random"" in the sense that they do not follow a pattern that we can predict.\r\n\r\nOne way to understand why pi is an infinite, non-repeating decimal is to think about trying to measure the circumference and diameter of a circle using a ruler. No matter how carefully you measure, there will always be some small amount of error in your measurement.

How does Nasa know the exact course to chart with their space probes to get them on different planets ? ELI5 : How does Nasa know the exact course to chart with their space probes to get them on different planets ? Explain like I'm five.,"['To get a space probe to a specific planet, NASA uses a combination of math and physics. They use math to calculate the path that the probe should take, taking into account things like the distance between the probe and the planet and the speed at which the probe is traveling. They also use physics to understand how the probe will be affected by things like the gravity of other planets and the sun, which can affect its course. One way that NASA figures out the best path for a space probe is by using a technique called ""orbital mechanics."" This involves using math and physics to predict how a probe will move in space based on the forces acting on it, such as gravity and the push of its engines. Once they have a good understanding of the probe\'s path, NASA can then use this information to plan the course of the probe and make any necessary adjustments along the way to ensure that it stays on track. This might involve using the probe\'s engines to change its speed or direction, or using the gravity of other objects in space to ""slingshot"" the probe towards its destination. Overall, it takes a lot of careful planning and precise calculations to get a space probe to a specific planet, but by using math and physics, NASA is able to chart a course that will get the probe where it needs to go.']",1,fake,0.9920719,1,True

How does a ranked voting system work ? I keep hearing that it is better the USA 's current system of voting but how so ? And how would it help eliminate the 2 party system ? Please explain like I'm five.,"[""A ranked voting system is a way of casting and counting votes in an election where voters are able to rank the candidates in order of preference. Instead of just choosing one candidate, voters can indicate their top choice, second choice, third choice, and so on.In a ranked voting system, if a candidate wins a majority of first-choice votes, they are declared the winner just like in a normal election. If no candidate wins a majority of first-choice votes, then the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated and their votes are redistributed to the voters' next choice. This process is repeated until one candidate has a majority of votes and is declared the winner.One advantage of ranked voting is that it can help ensure that the winner of an election has the support of a majority of voters, rather than just a plurality of voters. In a normal election, it is possible for a candidate to win with less than 50% of the vote if there are more than two candidates running. In a ranked voting system, this is less likely to happen because the votes of the least popular candidate can be redistributed to the voters' next choice.As for how a ranked voting system could help eliminate the two-party system, it's important to note that ranked voting is just one of many potential reforms that could help encourage more political diversity. However, ranked voting could potentially help by making it easier for third-party candidates or independent candidates to win elections. Since voters are able to rank multiple candidates in order of preference, they can choose to support a third-party candidate as their first choice while still expressing a preference for one of the major party candidates as their second choice. This could make it more likely that a third-party candidate could win an election, or at least have a stronger influence on the outcome.""]",1,fake,0.99383247,1,True

For example, let\'s say there is a football game and the bookie sets the odds at 50/50 for each team to win. This means that the bookie thinks both teams have an equal chance of winning. If 100 people bet on the game, and 50 people bet on one team and 50 people bet on the other team, the bookie will make a profit no matter which team wins. This is because the bookie will keep the money from the losing bets, and pay out the winnings to the people who bet on the winning team.

For example, if a player is able to consistently hit shots that are extremely difficult or impossible for a normal player to make, the anti-cheat system might flag this as suspicious activity and take action to investigate further. Another way anti-cheat systems work is by scanning a player's computer for any software or programs that could be used to cheat. If the system finds any suspicious programs, it will take action to prevent the player from using them while they are playing the game. Anti-cheat systems can be improved in a number of ways. One way is by constantly updating the algorithms and rules that are used to detect suspicious behavior. This can help to ensure that the system is able to catch new and emerging forms of cheating. Another way to improve anti-cheat systems is by working closely with game developers to ensure that the system is able to properly detect and prevent cheating in their games.

How do people make aimbots ? Something I 've always been curious about .

Explain like I'm five.","[""Ants are able to survive falls that would be very dangerous for humans because they have a number of adaptations that help them to protect themselves. First of all, ants are very small, which means that they have a smaller surface area and less mass, so they experience less force when they fall. This means that they don't hit the ground as hard as a larger animal like a human would. Secondly, ants have a hard exoskeleton, which is a hard outer shell that covers their body. This exoskeleton helps to protect them from injury when they fall, because it absorbs some of the force of the impact. Finally, ants are able to move their legs and antennae very quickly when they fall, which helps them to orient themselves in mid-air and land on their feet.
