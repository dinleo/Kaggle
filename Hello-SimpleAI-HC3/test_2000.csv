How do I know if a dividend stock is “safe” and not a “dividend yield trap”?,"['Dividend yield trap is a term used to describe a stock that has a high dividend yield, but the dividend is not sustainable and is at risk of being cut or eliminated. This can happen if the company\'s financial performance is deteriorating and it can no longer afford to pay out dividends.To determine if a dividend stock is ""safe,"" you should evaluate the company\'s financial health and stability. Here are a few things you can consider:Dividend payout ratio: This is the percentage of the company\'s earnings that is paid out as dividends. A high payout ratio may indicate that the company is paying out more in dividends than it can afford, which could put the dividend at risk.Earnings growth: A company\'s ability to pay dividends depends on its ability to generate profits. Look for companies with a track record of consistent and growing earnings, as this suggests that the company is financially stable and capable of paying dividends.Debt levels: High levels of debt can be a risk for dividends, as the company may need to use its profits to pay down debt rather than paying dividends.Industry and market conditions: The overall health of the industry and the economy can also impact a company\'s ability to pay dividends.It\'s also a good idea to diversify your portfolio by including a mix of dividend-paying and non-dividend-paying stocks, rather than relying too heavily on dividends as a source of income. This can help reduce risk in your portfolio.It\'s important to keep in mind that investing in stocks, including dividend-paying stocks, carries risks, and there is no guarantee that you will receive dividends or that the dividends will be sustained. It\'s always a good idea to do your own research and consult with a financial professional before making investment decisions.']",1
How do I know if a dividend stock is “safe” and not a “dividend yield trap”?,"['Let me provide a general answer, that might be helpful to others, without addressing those specific stocks. Dividends are simply corporate payouts made to the shareholders of the company.  A company often decides to pay dividends because they have excess cash on hand and choose to return it to shareholders by quarterly payouts instead of stock buy backs or using the money to invest in new projects. I\'m not exactly sure what you mean by ""dividend yield traps.""  If a company has declared an dividend for the upcoming quarter they will almost always pay.  There are exceptions, like what happened with BP, but these exceptions are rare.  Just because a company promises to pay a dividend in the approaching quarter does not mean that it will continue to pay a dividend in the future.  If the company continues to pay a dividend in the future, it may be at a (significantly) different amount. Some companies are structured where nearly all of there corporate profits flow through to shareholders via dividends.  These companies may have ""unusually"" high dividends, but this is simply a result of the corporate structure.    Let me provide a quick example: Certain ETFs that track bonds pay a dividend as a way to pass through interest payments from the underlying bonds back to the shareholder of the ETF. There is no company that will continue to pay their dividend at the present rate with 100% certainty.  Even large companies like General Electric slashed its dividend during the most recent financial crisis.  So, to evaluate whether a company will keep paying a dividend you should look at the following: Update: In regards to one the first stock you mentioned, this sentence from the companies of Yahoo! finance explains the ""unusually"" dividend: The company has elected to be treated as a REIT for federal income tax purposes and would not be subject to income tax, if it distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income to its share holders.']",0
How do I know if refinance is beneficial enough to me?,"[""There are a few key factors to consider when deciding whether refinancing your mortgage is a good idea:Interest rate: If you can secure a lower interest rate on your new mortgage, refinancing can be a good idea, as it can result in lower monthly payments and potentially save you thousands of dollars in interest over the life of the loan.Length of loan: If you're considering refinancing a long-term mortgage (such as a 30-year loan), it may be beneficial to refinance into a shorter-term loan (such as a 15-year loan). This can result in higher monthly payments, but you'll pay off the loan faster and pay less in total interest.Closing costs: Before refinancing, be sure to consider the closing costs associated with the new loan. These costs can include fees for things like appraisals, credit reports, and legal documents. If the cost of these fees is high relative to the amount of money you'll save through refinancing, it may not be worth it.Credit score: If you have a good credit score, you may be able to qualify for a lower interest rate on a new mortgage. This can make refinancing more beneficial, as you'll pay less in interest over the life of the loan.Financial goals: Before refinancing, consider your long-term financial goals. If you plan to stay in your home for many years, it may make sense to refinance into a lower interest rate, even if it means paying closing costs. If you're planning to sell your home in the near future, however, refinancing may not be worth it, as you may not recoup the closing costs through lower monthly payments.""]",1
How do I know if refinance is beneficial enough to me?,"[""The proper answer is that you run the numbers and see whether what you'll save in interest exceeds the closing costs by enough to be interesting.  Most lenders these days have calculations that can help with this on their websites and/or would be glad to help if asked. Rule of thumb: if you can reduce interest rate by 1% or more it's worth investing.""]",0
"How do I know the color red I 'm seeing is actually the same color red you are seeing ? The age old stoner question . Shorthand answer , please ! Explain like I'm five.","[""You do n't First , you must realize that light is a wave . Your eye has 3 receptors that are each specialized in catching a certain wavelength .

Now , color blind people can take a color and then take two other lights and shine them on the wall and adjust the wavelength of the light coming out of them and match the first color . Non colorblind people need to use 3 flashlights in order to match the color . This is because the wavelength receptors do n't always have the same level of sensitivity . Since we are all pretty much unique individuals , it would be safe to assume that not everyone 's eyes pick things up in the exact same way . The color blindness is an extreme example of this . So no , everyone has color receptors that send signals to the brain to be decoded .

However, there are a few reasons why it is likely that the color red that you see is the same as the color red that I see: The color red is a specific wavelength of light, and our eyes are designed to recognize and interpret this specific wavelength as the color red. The color red is also a physical property of objects, and our brains are able to recognize and interpret this physical property as the color red.

How do I know what loan terms I can qualify for?,"[""There are several factors that lenders consider when determining what loan terms you can qualify for, including your credit score, income, debt-to-income ratio, and the type of loan you are seeking. Here are some general guidelines to help you understand what loan terms you may be able to qualify for:Credit score: Lenders typically use your credit score to assess your creditworthiness and determine what loan terms you may be eligible for. Generally, the higher your credit score, the more favorable the loan terms you may be able to secure.Income: Lenders will also consider your income when determining what loan terms you may be able to qualify for. The higher your income, the more likely you are to be approved for a loan and the better the terms you may be able to secure.Debt-to-income ratio: This is a measure of how much of your income goes towards paying off debts. Lenders generally prefer to see a debt-to-income ratio of 43% or lower, although some may be willing to consider higher ratios depending on your credit score and other factors.Type of loan: Different types of loans have different requirements, so the terms you may be able to qualify for will depend on the type of loan you are seeking. For example, mortgage loans typically have stricter requirements than personal loans, and may require a higher credit score and a lower debt-to-income ratio to qualify.It's important to note that these are just general guidelines and that actual loan terms can vary widely depending on the lender and your specific circumstances. To get a more accurate idea of what loan terms you may be able to qualify for, it's a good idea to speak with a lender or financial advisor.""]",1
How do I know what loan terms I can qualify for?,"['You can find out the most money they will loan you for a car loan when you approach your current bank/credit union. They should be willing to layout options based on your income, and credit history. You then have to decide if those terms work for you. There are several dangers with getting loan estimates, they may be willing to lend you more than you can actually handle. They think you can afford it, but maybe you can\'t. They may also have a loan with a longer term, which does bring the monthly cost down, but exposes you to being upside down on the loan. You then use this a a data point when looking at other lenders. The last place you look is the auto dealer. They will be trying to pressure you on both the loan and the price, that is not the time to do doing complex mental calculations. The Suntrust web page was interesting, it included the quote: The lowest rate in each range is for LightStream\'s unsecured auto loan   product and requires that you have an excellent credit profile. It also induced the example the rate of 2.19% - 4.24%   for a 24 to 36 month loan of $10,000 to $24,999 for a used car purchased from a dealer. Also note that my local credit union has a new/used loan at 1.49%, but you have to be a member. Sunstrust seems to be in the minority. In general a loan for X$ and y months will have a lower rate if it is secured with collateral.  But Suntrust is offering unsecured loans (i.e. no collateral) at a low rate. The big benefit for their product is that you get the cash today. You can get the cash before you know what you want to buy. You get the cash before you have negotiated with the dealer. That makes that step easier. Now will they in the near future ask for proof you bought a car with the money? no idea. If you went to the same web page and wanted a debt consolidation loan the rate for the same $ range and the same months is: 5.49% - 11.24% the quote now changes to: The lowest rate in each range requires that you have an excellent   credit profile. I have no idea what rate they will actually approve you for. It is possible that if you don\'t have excellent credit the rate rises quickly, but 4.24% for the worst auto loan is better than 5.49% for the best debt consolidation. Excellent Credit Given the unique nature of each individual’s credit situation,   LightStream believes there is no single definition for ""excellent   credit"". However, we find individuals with excellent credit usually   share the following characteristics: Finally, it should be noted again that each individual situation is   different and that we make our credit judgment based on the specific   facts of that situation. Ultimately our determination of excellent   credit is based on whether we conclude that there is a very high   likelihood that our loan will be repaid in a full and timely manner.

"How do I manually calculate the subnetmask of a network ? ( IPv4 ) I need to know how many subnets I need , how to calculate from that what the subnet is , the ip and the subnetmask ! thank you very much guys ! Explain like I'm five.","['Sure! I\'d be happy to help you understand how to manually calculate the subnet mask of a network. First, let\'s start with the basics. A subnet mask is a 32-bit number that is used to divide a network into smaller subnetworks, or subnets. It works by dividing the IP address of a device into two parts: the network portion and the host portion. The subnet mask determines which part of the IP address belongs to the network and which part belongs to the host. Now, let\'s say you want to create subnets for a network with the IP address range 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.255. To do this, you need to decide how many subnets you want to create and how many hosts you want on each subnet. For example, let\'s say you want to create 4 subnets, each with 16 hosts. To calculate the subnet mask, you would do the following: Write down the number of subnets and hosts in binary form. In this case, you want 4 subnets, so you would write ""100"" in binary. You want 16 hosts, so you would write ""10000"" in binary. Add the two binary numbers together. In this case, the sum is ""100010000"". Convert the binary number to decimal form. To do this, you would multiply each digit by the corresponding power of 2 and add the results. In this case, the decimal form of the binary number is ""320"". Write down the IP address range in dot-decimal notation. In this case, the IP address range is 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.255. Add the subnet mask to the IP address. To do this, you would combine the subnet mask (320) with the IP address using dot-decimal notation. The resulting IP address would be ""192.168.1.320"". This is the basic process for calculating the subnet mask of a network. I hope this helps to explain the concept! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.']",1

Are you asking some kind of homework question without any context ?', ""So you have 3 choises as far as subnets are concerned . * Class A - 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 * Class B - 172.16.0.0 . - 172.32.255.255 * Class C - 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 All each subnet is doing is defining the maximum number of hosts you may have on a LAN . What defines when you need to begin routing is your netmask . This string generally looks like 255.255.255.0 on most standards home networks and small offices . This may also be represented as in CIDR notation as $ IP/24 in which 24 represents the number of active bits in your netmask . Now this is where things tend to get confusing : For example : I have a class A network of 10.1.1.0/24 . What this defines is the size of my network it is saying I can use 10.1.1.1 - 10.1.1.254 * * WITHOUT * * the need to define a route to another network say 10.1.2.0/24 . If I want to contact a host on say 10.1.2.15 I would need a default gateway for a host on my network to contact the host on the other network . If I do n't want to use a router I can simply set both networks to 10.1.0.0/16 . This gives me a range of 10.1.0.1 - 10.1.255.254 . What your netmask is effectually doing is telling your Operating System to ignore any IP addresses of a different subnet . By lowering the number of bits in your netmask you expand how many address the Operating System is willing to look at . So if you want to do something fun and learn something . Create 2 Hosts on different subnets such as 10.1.1.1/24 and 10.1.2.1/24 . See if each system can ping one another . After that set one of the hosts to 10.1.1.1/16 and leave the other .

How do I pick the right company for investing services?,"['Traditional brokers There are tons of players in this market, especially in USA. You have traditional brokers, brokers tied to your bank and a bunch of startups. The easiest is probably a broker tied to your bank, because you probably don\'t have to wait to fund your brokerage account and can start trading immediately. Often the older/traditional brokers don\'t have very intuitive interfaces, it\'s the startups who do a better job at this. But honestly it doesn\'t really matter, because you can use reporting services that are different from the services you use to execute your trades. Meaning that you only use the interface of your broker to execute trades (buy or sell), and use third party services to monitor your holdings. Monitoring services: Google Finance, Yahoo Finance, Sigfig, Morningstar,... are services allowing you to monitor your holdings. But you can\'t execute trades with them. Start-ups: Then there are a bunch of startups that offer investment services besides the traditional brokers. Start-up > Robinhood The most ambitious one is Robinhood, which offers the same service as a traditional broker, but completely free (most of the traditional brokers charge a flat fee and/or percentage when buying/selling hodlings) and with an intuitive interface. They\'re mobile first, but announced they will be launching their service on the web soon. Start-up > Acorns Another popular, mobile-first start-up is Acorns. They offer a lazy-investing service which rounds your everyday purchases and uses the change to invest. It\'s great when investing is not on your mind, but you still want to invest without realizing it. Start-ups > Robo-advisors Robo-advisors auto-invest your money across a bunch of funds picked based on your risk profile. Because the robo-advisers are fairly new, they often have the most intuitive interfaces. These robo-advisors often don\'t allow you to pick individual holdings, so these services are best when you want to passively invest. Meaning you don\'t want to look at it very often, and let them do the investing for you. There are tons of robo-advisor start-ups: Betterment, Wealthfront, Personal Capital, Sigfig, FutureAdvisor,... Also bigger parties jumped on this trend with their offerings: Schwab Intelligent Portfolios, Ally Managed Portfolio, Vanguard Personal Advisor, etc. Summary: It\'s fun to pick individual stocks, but if you start out it can be overwhelming. Robinhood is probably the best start, they have reduced functionality, but gets you going with an attractive interface. But soon you\'ll realize it\'s extremely hard to beat the market. Meaning that hand-picking stocks statistically gives you a worse return than just buying into the general stock market (like S&P500). So you can decide to just buy one fund with a traditional broker that covers the general stock market. Or you can decide to try out one of the many robo-advisors. They haven\'t been around that long, so it\'s hard to tell how effective these are and whether they beat the market. If you\'re young, and you believe in start-ups (who often try to challenge the traditional players), try out one of the robo-advisors. If you want to play a bit and are addicted to your smartphone, try out Robinhood. If you are addicted to your phone, but don\'t want to check up on your investments all the time, go for Acorns. Of course you can combine all these. Lastly, there are tons of cryptocurrencies which might give you a large return. Tons of startups offer intuitive interfaces to trade cryptocurrencies like Coinbase, Gemini, Kraken. But beware, there is a lot of risk involved in trading cryptocurrencies, it\'s completely unregulated etc. But definitely check them out. Oh, and you can also invest by giving out loans through LendingClub, Prosper etc. Who can you trust? Above gives you an overview of your options intermingled with some reasoning. But regarding your question ""who can I trust"" in terms of advice, it\'s up to yourself. Most traditional broker services don\'t give you any advice at all, you\'re on your own. Robo-advisors don\'t give you advice either, but let their proprietary algorithm do the job. Are these reliable? Nobody can tell, they haven\'t been around long enough, and they need to go through a bear market (a crash) to see how they respond during rough times.

How do I protect money above the FDIC coverage limit?,"[""The FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) is a government agency that provides insurance coverage for deposits in banks and savings institutions up to $250,000 per depositor, per institution. If you have more money than the FDIC coverage limit, you can consider the following options to protect your funds:Spread your money among different financial institutions: You can open accounts at multiple banks or credit unions, so that each account is insured up to the FDIC limit. This way, even if one institution fails, your deposits at other institutions will be protected.Invest in FDIC-insured products: Some financial products, such as certificates of deposit (CDs) and money market accounts, are FDIC-insured up to the coverage limit. You can consider investing in these products to protect your money.Use a bank with higher coverage limits: Some banks offer higher coverage limits than the FDIC, either through private insurance or by purchasing additional FDIC coverage. You can check with individual banks to see if they offer higher coverage limits.Consider other types of insurance: In addition to FDIC insurance, you can also consider other types of insurance, such as private bank deposit insurance, to protect your money.It's important to note that no insurance program can guarantee the safety of your deposits.

How do I protect myself from a scam if I want to help a relative?,"['Mostly ditto to @grade\'eh\'bacon, but let me add a couple of comments: Before I did anything, I\'d find out more about what\'s going on. Anytime someone tells me that there\'s a problem with ""security codes or something"", I get cautious. Think about what the possibilities are here. Your relative is being scammed. In that case, helping him to transfer his money to the scammer is not the kind of help you really want to give. Despite your firm belief in your relative\'s integrity, he may have been seduced by the dark side. If he\'s doing something illegal, I\'d be very careful about getting involved. My friends and relatives don\'t ask me to commit crimes for them, especially not in a way that leaves me holding the bag if things go wrong. Assuming that what is going on here is all legal and ethical, still there is the possibility that you could be making yourself liable for taxes, fees, whatever. At the very least I\'d want to know what those are up front. As @Grade\'eh\'bacon, if he really has a problem with a lost password or expired account, by all means help him fix that problem.

How do I refinance a car loan into someone else's name so it can be their car?,"[""To refinance a car loan into someone else's name, you will need to go through the process of transferring ownership of the car to the other person. This typically involves paying off the current loan and obtaining a new loan in the other person's name. Here are the general steps you can follow:Pay off the current loan: You will need to pay off the remaining balance on the current loan before you can transfer the loan to someone else. This can usually be done by making a final payment to the lender or by refinancing the loan.Transfer ownership of the car: You will need to transfer ownership of the car to the other person. This typically involves signing the car's title over to the other person and obtaining a new title in their name. You may also need to provide proof of insurance and register the car in the other person's name.Obtain a new loan in the other person's name: Once the car is in the other person's name, they can apply for a new loan to refinance the car in their name. They will need to meet the lender's eligibility requirements, such as having a good credit score and sufficient income.Make sure the loan is secured by the car: It is important to make sure that the new loan is secured by the car, so that the lender has the right to repossess the car if the borrower defaults on the loan. This typically requires the borrower to sign a security agreement and provide the lender with a copy of the car's title.Sign any necessary documents: You and the other person will need to sign any necessary documents to complete the transfer of ownership and the refinancing of the loan. Make sure to read and understand all documents before signing them, and consult with an attorney or financial advisor if you have any questions."", ""To refinance a car loan into someone else's name, you will need to follow these steps:Check if the lender allows co-signers or co-borrowers: Some lenders may allow you to add someone else to your car loan as a co-signer or co-borrower.

How do I report book royalties for tax purposes?,"['If you receive book royalties, you will need to report them as income on your tax return.

How do I report book royalties for tax purposes?,"['(Insert the usual disclaimer that I\'m not any sort of tax professional; I\'m just a random guy on the Internet who occasionally looks through IRS instructions for fun. Then again, what you\'re doing here is asking random people on the Internet for help, so here goes.) The gigantic book of ""How to File Your Income Taxes"" from the IRS is called Publication 17. That\'s generally where I start to figure out where to report what. The section on Royalties has this to say: Royalties from copyrights, patents, and oil, gas, and mineral properties are taxable as ordinary income. In most cases, you report royalties in Part I of Schedule E (Form 1040). However, if you hold an operating oil, gas, or mineral interest or are in business as a self-employed writer, inventor, artist, etc., report your income and expenses on Schedule C or Schedule C-EZ (Form 1040).  It sounds like you are receiving royalties from a copyright, and not as a self-employed writer. That means that you would report the income on Schedule E, Part I. I\'ve not used Schedule E before, but looking at the instructions for it, you enter this as ""Royalty Property"". For royalty property, enter code “6” on line 1b and leave lines 1a and 2 blank for that property. So, in Line 1b, part A, enter code 6. (It looks like you\'ll only use section A here as you only have one royalty property.) Then in column A, Line 4, enter the royalties you have received. The instructions confirm that this should be the amount that you received listed on the 1099-MISC. Report on line 4 royalties from oil, gas, or mineral properties (not including operating interests); copyrights; and patents. Use a separate column (A, B, or C) for each royalty property. If you received $10 or more in royalties during 2016, the payer should send you a Form 1099-MISC or similar statement by January 31, 2017, showing the amount you received. Report this amount on line 4.  I don\'t think that there\'s any relevant Expenses deductions you could take on the subsequent lines (though like I said, I\'ve not used this form before), but if you had some specific expenses involved in producing this income it might be worth looking into further. On Line 21 you\'d subtract the 0 expenses (or subtract any expenses you do manage to list) and put the total. It looks like there are more totals to accumulate on lines 23 and 24, which presumably would be equally easy as you only have the one property. Put the total again on line 26, which says to enter it on the main Form 1040 on line 17 and it thus gets included in your income.']",0
How do I research if my student loan company is doing something illegal?,"['The thing to recall here is that auto-pay is a convenience, not a guarantee. Auto-pay withdrawals, notices that a bill is due, all of these are niceties that the lender uses to try to make sure you consistently pay your bill on time, as all businesses enjoy steady cash flows. Now, what all of these ""quality of life"" features don\'t do is mitigate your responsibility, as outlined when you first took out the loan, to pay it back in a timely manner and according to the terms and conditions of the loan. If your original contract for the loan states you shall make ""a payment of $X.XX each calendar month"", then you are required to make that payment one way or another. If auto-pay fails, you are still obligated to monitor that and correct the payment to ensure you meet your contractual obligation. It\'s less than pleasant that they didn\'t notify you, but you were already aware you had an obligation to pay back the loan, and knew what the terms of the loan were. Any forgiveness of interest or penalties for late fees is entirely up to the CSR and the company\'s internal policies, not the law.']",0

You can file a complaint with the CFPB if you believe your student loan company is engaging in illegal activity.Research the company online: You can use search engines and online databases to see if there have been any lawsuits or regulatory actions taken against your student loan company. You can also check with industry organizations and professional associations to see if there have been any complaints or disciplinary actions taken against the company.Contact a lawyer: If you believe your student loan company is engaging in illegal activity, you may want to consider consulting with a lawyer who can advise you on your options and help you take legal action if necessary.It's important to note that even if your student loan company is engaging in legal activity, you may still have options for resolving any issues you have with your loans.

How do I set up my finances when first moving out?,"[""The first thing you need to do is to set yourself a budget. Total all your money coming in (from jobs, allowances, etc.) and all your money going out (including rent, utilities, loan repayments, food, other essential and the luxuries).  If your money coming in is more than your money going out, then you are onto a positive start. If on the other hand your money going out is more than the money coming in, then you are at the beginning of big trouble. You will have to do at least one of 2 things, either increase your income or reduce your expenses or both. You will have to go through all your expenses (money going out) and cut back on the luxuries, try to get cheaper alternatives for some of your essential, and get a second job or increase your hours at your current job. The aim is to always have more money coming in than the money you spend. The second thing to do is to pay off any outstanding debts by paying more than the minimum amounts and then have some savings goals. You said you wanted to save for a car - that is one saving goal. Another saving goal could be to set up a 6 month emergency fund (enough money in a separate account to be able to survive at least 6 months in case something happened, such as you lost your job or you suddenly got sick). Next you could look at getting a higher education so you can go out and get higher paying jobs. When you do get a higher paying job, the secret is not to spend all your extra money coming in on luxuries, you should treat yourself but do not go overboard. Increase the amounts you save and learn how to invest so you can get your savings to work harder for you. Building a sound financial future for yourself takes a lot of hard work and discipline, but once you do get started and change the way you do things you will find that it doesn't take long for things to start getting easier. The one thing you do have going for you is time; you are starting early and have time on your side.""]",0
How do I set up my finances when first moving out?,"[""Congratulations on taking the first steps towards financial independence! Here are a few steps you can take to set up your finances when moving out for the first time:Create a budget: The first step in managing your finances is to determine how much money you have coming in and going out each month. This will help you understand your financial situation and identify areas where you may need to cut back.Set financial goals: Consider what you want to achieve financially in the short and long term. Do you want to save for a down payment on a house, pay off student loans, or build an emergency fund? Setting financial goals will help you make a plan and stay on track.Open a checking and savings account: It's a good idea to have separate accounts for your everyday expenses (checking) and long-term savings (savings). Look for accounts with low fees and good interest rates.Start saving for emergencies: Unexpected expenses can arise at any time, so it's important to have an emergency fund to fall back on. Aim to save enough money to cover three to six months' worth of living expenses.Pay your bills on time: Late fees and additional interest can add up quickly, so make sure to pay your bills on time. Consider setting up automatic payments to ensure you don't forget.Use credit responsibly: If you decide to use credit cards, be sure to pay off the balance in full each month to avoid accruing interest. Avoid taking on more debt than you can afford to pay back.I hope these suggestions are helpful as you start your journey towards financial independence. If you have any further questions, don't hesitate to ask.""]",1
How do I start getting into the stock market ? Where do i buy stocks and how do they work ? Explain like I'm five.,"['To do it , you need to open an account with a broker . There are quite a few : Schwab , Fidelity , E*Trade , etc . Just google "" stock broker "" . You \'ll have to find a way to give them money , such as direct transfer from your bank account , sending them a check , etc . Keep in mind that they generally charge you for each transaction ; usually less than $ 20 . But since you also asked "" how do they work "" , it means you have not done your homework . So you should instead just get some cash , pile it up , and light it on fire . It will be quicker and easier , and the result will be pretty much the same .', 'Well , this has many different answers and many different starting points , depending on how old you are , your financial situation etc . I \'m not expert , but I \'ll take a crack at it . So because you did n\'t say any details , I \'ll assume you \'re an adult with some money you want to invest , but no idea what to do . First of all , * * make sure you have your finances sorted * * . You do n\'t want to invest everything you have and end up owing thousands . Figure out what you have to invest , how much you are willing to potentially lose , and then do ~~some~~ LOTS of research . Buy your local newpaper and look in the finance section , or go on URL_0 and do some research . The overall goal of stocks is to buy them when they \'re low ( so when they \'re in the red and going down ) but from companies that you know will bounce back . For example sake , let \'s say Coke has a stock that costs $ 5 . You go online and see it has gone down to $ 3 . You know that \'s lower than usual , but now you have to make a decision- do I trust Coke to bounce back and go back to $ 5 and even higher , so I can sell it for a profit , or is this stock going to tank and lose me my money ? So find stocks that are in your price range that are going down , that you feel will go up and high enough to a point that you will be able to sell them for a profit . Those are basics , there are tons of websites and books to get more details . Now , as for actually buying stocks , you have some options . Direct buy , online discount broker , and full service broker . To simplify it , direct buy means just that- you buy the stocks directly at your own risk and call , and that \'s that . You can call the company and ask if they have this option ( not all do ) and many websites are made for this specific purpose . A discount broker is someone who you tell "" I want _ _ _ _ amount of _ _ _ _ stock for _ _ _ _ _ dollars "" . You give them the money , and they go out and do it . You \'re making the decision , but they \'re waiting for the stocks to hit the sweet spot you gave them , and make the buy for you . ( They usually charge you a charge per trade you ask them to make , so this will cost you a little more . ) A full service broker makes the decisions basically . You have a say and ideas , but he advises you and will guide you towards which route to take . You \'re really putting all your faith into his investments . This is pretty expensive and usually for people who have a lot of money to use and are looking for big risk / reward type situations . As I said , expensive since they basically do all the work for you , and are often paid by commission or by how much you trade , so often times they may tell you to buy certain stocks / advise you to make a move even if it probably wo n\'t work out , just so they get paid . Hope this helps !', 'simplest way i tell my clients : 1 . ask your self why you want to get into the stock market 2 . how much back ground knowledge do you have ? basically how sophisticated of an investor are you ? 3 . determine you disposable income ( basically amount you can afford to lose ) 4 . what is you investment objective ? ( make lots of money vs constant growth ) 5 . understand risk - return relationship 6 . understand that there is no perfect strategy in investment although there are theories about stock investing you can follow 7 . figure out how often you will be trading and understand that there will most likely be a transaction cost e.g brokerage fees or trading cost 8 find the best platform you can use to start trading . once you have seriously considered these , you should be in the right state of mind to start investing . there are TONS of books on strategies to use when trading stocks . so read and pick or just ask an advisor ( i recommend doing research yourself 1st since you all advisor are actually qualified ) . i know this does answer your question directly about you should seriously consider these questions .']",0
How do I start getting into the stock market ? Where do i buy stocks and how do they work ? Explain like I'm five.,"[""Great question! The stock market is a place where people buy and sell shares of stock in public companies. When you buy a share of stock, you are buying a small ownership stake in that company. For example, if you buy one share of a company's stock, you own a very small piece of that company. There are many different ways to buy and sell stocks, but one of the most common is to open a brokerage account. A brokerage account is like a bank account, but for buying and selling stocks. To open a brokerage account, you will need to choose a brokerage firm and follow their process for opening an account. This usually involves filling out some paperwork and potentially providing some identification documents. Once you have a brokerage account, you can use it to buy and sell stocks through the brokerage's website or app. When you buy a stock, you are essentially betting that the company will do well in the future. If the company does well and the value of the stock goes up, you can sell your shares for a profit. However, if the company does poorly and the value of the stock goes down, you may lose money. It's important to note that investing in the stock market carries risks, and you should be prepared to potentially lose money. It's also a good idea to do your own research and consider consulting with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.""]",1

Explain like I'm five.","['There are a few simple tests you can try to determine whether a diamond is real or fake: The Fog Test: Hold the diamond in front of your mouth and fog it up with your breath. If the diamond is real, the fog should dissipate quickly. If it stays fogged up for a longer period of time, it may be a fake. The Water Test: Drop the diamond into a glass of water. If it sinks, it is likely a real diamond. If it floats, it is probably a fake. The Loupe Test: Use a loupe (a small magnifying glass) to examine the diamond closely. Look for inclusions, which are tiny imperfections that are usually not visible to the naked eye. Real diamonds usually have inclusions, while fake diamonds are often flawless. The Heat Test: Hold the diamond with a pair of tweezers and use a lighter to heat the stone for about 30 seconds. Real diamonds are able to conduct heat very well, so the stone should not get very hot. If the diamond gets hot quickly, it may be a fake. Keep in mind that these tests are not foolproof and can only give you a general idea of whether the diamond is real or fake. To be sure, you should have the diamond examined by a professional jeweler.']",1

A premium is the amount of money that a person pays to an insurance company for coverage. Insurance companies use the premiums they collect to pay for the claims that their customers make.

How do Islamic Banking give loans for housing purposes?,"['Islamic banking is a financial system that operates in accordance with Islamic principles and laws, also known as sharia. One of the key principles of Islamic finance is the prohibition of interest, or riba. This means that traditional methods of lending, such as charging interest on loans, are not permitted in Islamic finance.Instead, Islamic banks use profit and loss sharing arrangements to provide financing for housing and other purposes. These arrangements involve the bank providing capital to the borrower and sharing in the profits or losses generated by the use of the capital. For example, in the case of a housing loan, the bank may provide financing for the construction or purchase of a property, and the borrower would then pay the bank a portion of the profits generated by the property (e.g. rental income).Islamic banks may also use other sharia-compliant financing structures, such as murabaha (cost-plus financing), istisna (pre-production financing), and ijara (leasing). These structures involve the bank providing financing for a specific asset or project, with the borrower repaying the financing over time.It is important to note that Islamic banking is not a uniform system, and the specific details of how loans are structured and provided may vary between different Islamic banks and countries. If you are interested in obtaining an Islamic housing loan, it is advisable to contact an Islamic bank or financial institution and discuss your options with them.']",1
How do Islamic Banking give loans for housing purposes?,"['As I understand it, if the ""borrower"" puts a down payment of 20% and the bank puts down 80%, then the bank and the ""borrower"" own the home jointly as  tenants in common with a 20%-80% split of the asset amongst them. The  ""borrower"" moves into the home and pays the bank 80% of the fair rental  value of the home each month.  {Material added/changed in edit: For the purposes of illustration, suppose that the ""borrower"" and the bank agree that the fair rental per month is 0.5% of the purchase cost. The  ""borrower"" pays 80% of that amount i.e. 0.4% of the purchase cost  to the bank on a monthly basis.  The ""borrower"" is not required to do  so but may choose to pay more money than this 0.4% of the purchase cost each month, or pay some amount in a lump sum. If he does so, he will own a larger percentage of the house, and so future monthly payments will be a smaller fraction of the agreed-upon fair rental per month. So there is an incentive to pay off the bank.} If and when the house is sold, the sale price is divided between ""borrower"" and bank according to the percentage of ownership as of the date of sale. So the bank gets to share in the profits, if any. On the other hand, if the house is sold for less than the original purchase price, then the bank also suffers in the loss. It is not a case of a mortgage being paid off from the proceeds and the home-owner gets whatever is left, or even suffering a loss when the dust has settled; the bank gets only its percentage of the sale price even if this amount is less than what it put up in the first place minus any additional payments made by the ""borrower"".

Explain like I'm five.","['This is actually two separate things , key gens do n\'t really have anything to do with the "" crack "" per se because you usually apply the crack once the game is installed . So I \'ll break your question into two parts . Software keys are generated using an algorithm , sometimes this is based on a check - sum ( just add up everything and it has to be a specific number ) or an encryption algorithm or a combination of things . A peice of software does n\'t know every single key , that would be incredibly impractical . For example , The Sims shipped 16 million copies . If each copy had a key stored in the software , and each key had 16 numbers in it the file to store all of those would be 16million x 16 bytes would be 244 MB or about 1/3 of an entire CD just to keep them in plain text . So instead , you have a a subroutine within the software to see if a key is "" valid "" or not . Crackers go in to the software , find the checking algorithm , reverse it and use that to start generating keys . * ELI5 * Your classmate has a club , everyone in the club has a membership number . There \'s a guy who stands at the front door of the clubhouse , asks everyone what their member number is , thinks about it for a while then either lets you in or turns you away . You spy on the door guy with a telescope and realize he \'s just taking the membership numbers , adding the digits up in a calculator and if it equals 27 , he lets you in . So your friends use this knowledge to make up your own numbers that add up to 27 and you get in . The second part of your question , the actual crack . Software companies have long known how flimsy software keys are , they \'re basically just to ward off the most amateur software pirates . So they came up with ways , once the software is installed , to make sure you have real access . This check is buried in the compiled .exe file that actually starts the game . There \'s a lot of systems in - place to prevent pirated software from actually running like unique checksums at the begining of the disc , read speed tests and a bunch of other stuff . But that was n\'t your question so I wo n\'t really get into that . So what software crackers do is go into the .exe through various decompiling techniques , tear out or modify these security checks , recompile their cracked .exe and distribute it with the software . * ELI5 * So your friend manage to get past the guy at the front door but you then find out there \'s someone you actually have to check in with to get into the real part of the clubhouse . This guy is smarter than the door guy and not really worth the effort to try to lie your way past . So instead , you go into the bathroom , crawl up into the vent and jump down into the real part of the club , bypassing the whole check . EDIT : I suck at guessing words :(', 'Game companies would have a lot to manage if they created a unique key for each game they sold , things would get incredibly complicated with this system so they use algorithms ( Sometimes multiple different ones ) to determine if a key is legit or not .

"" Cracking "" a game is essentially tricking the game into thinking that it does n\'t need to be activated or already has been ( While the game is playable when cracked , multiplayer functions rarely work if the game requires a cd - key or some form of registration ) .

"How do Key Generators work and why are n't games harder to "" crack "" ? Should n't game companies be able to identify a key that is n't in retail distribution ? Explain like I'm five.","['Key generators, also known as ""keygens,"" are programs that generate unique product keys or serial numbers that can be used to activate software or games. Keygens are often used by people who want to use software or games without paying for them, which is known as pirating.\n\nThere are a few reasons why games may not be more difficult to ""crack"" (that is, to bypass the copy protection and use the game without paying for it). One reason is that game companies may not have the resources to constantly update their copy protection methods and make them more secure. Additionally, some game companies may not see cracking as a significant threat to their business, or they may be more focused on other aspects of their product, such as improving gameplay or adding new features.\n\nIt is theoretically possible for game companies to identify keys that are not in retail distribution and block them from activating the game. However, this would require significant resources and may not be practical for large companies with many different products and a large number of customers. It is also possible that keygens could be used to generate keys that are not detectable as illegitimate, making it difficult for game companies to effectively block them.\n\nUsing keygens to pirate software or games is illegal in many countries and can result in fines or other penalties. It is generally a better idea to support game developers and software creators by purchasing legitimate copies of their products.']",1
How do LLC losses affect personal income taxes in the US?,"[""The short answer is yes, losses get passed through to members.

How do LLC losses affect personal income taxes in the US?,"[""In the United States, a limited liability company (LLC) is a type of business structure that combines the liability protection of a corporation with the tax benefits of a partnership. LLCs are taxed as a partnership by default, but they can also elect to be taxed as a corporation.If an LLC is taxed as a partnership, the profits and losses of the business are passed through to the individual members of the LLC and are reported on their personal income tax returns. This means that the LLC does not pay taxes on its income at the corporate level; instead, the profits and losses are allocated to the members based on their ownership interests in the LLC and are taxed at the individual level.For example, if an LLC has a net loss for the year, each member of the LLC can claim their allocated share of the loss on their personal income tax return. This can help offset other sources of income and potentially reduce the member's overall tax liability. However, it's important to note that the IRS has rules in place to prevent individuals from using LLC losses to offset income from other sources in an abusive manner.If an LLC elects to be taxed as a corporation, it will be subject to corporate income tax on its profits. Any distributions to the members of the LLC will be treated as dividends, which are taxed at the individual level.It's worth noting that LLCs are generally more flexible than corporations when it comes to how profits and losses are allocated among the members. This can make them a good choice for small businesses that want to minimize their tax liability while still enjoying the liability protection of a corporation. However, it's important to consult with a tax professional to determine the best tax treatment for your LLC based on your specific circumstances.""]",1

People often need to buy new mattresses for various reasons, such as when they move to a new home, when their old mattress becomes uncomfortable or unsupportive, or when they want to upgrade to a higher-quality mattress. This means that there is a steady demand for mattresses, which can help support multiple mattress stores in a given area. \n2. Mattress stores may offer a wide range of products at different price points, which can appeal to people with different budgets and preferences. For example, some stores may focus on luxury mattresses, while others may offer more affordable options. \n3. Mattress stores may also offer financing options or other promotions, such as discounts or free delivery, to help make their products more accessible to potential customers. \n4. Finally, mattress stores may be able to stay in business by offering good customer service and a helpful shopping experience.

How do PH values actually work ? Why should ( for example ) going from ph7 to ph8 not to be considered an increase by 1 but an increase as an order of magnitude ? Hope my question makes sense . Explain like I'm five.,"[""When we use acids in water , we like to compare the concentration of protons [ H+ ] . A really important concept when thinking about aqueous acids and bases is a physical constant called Kw , it 's 1x10 ^ -14 , and it is defined as [ H+][OH- ] , i.e the concentration of protons multiplied by the concentration of hydroxyl ( OH- ) ions . This allows us to easily convert between [ OH- ] and [ H+ ] , as their product is constant . If we have a 1.0 M of HCl , then we might anticipate that that will fully break up into H+ and Cl- , giving us [ H+]=1.0M. If we have 1.0 M of NaOH , then we might expect that to fully break up into Na+ and OH- . We want to be able to compare the acidity of the solutions though , so we can convert [ OH-]=1.0 into a value of [ H+ ] using Kw . [ H+ ] = Kw/[OH- ] Giving us , for 1.0 M NaOH , [ H+ ] = 1x10 ^ -14 . Now , 1 and 1x10 ^ -14 are very different numbers , and we 're humans - we like numbers that we can think about , like 6 or 12 or 241 . So we can squeeze this entire range into a much ' nicer ' range of numbers ( 0 to 14 - but I 'll explain that ) . In order to compress this range of orders of magnitude we must use a logarithmic scale . All this means is that when go from pH 1 to ph 2 , we are changing an order of magnitude , not a single digit . The process of taking the logarithm of a number means that you are asking the question ' What power do I have to raise 10 to in order to get this number ' i.e log(10 ^ 6 ) = 6 . pH is defined as -log[H+ ] . There are non - trivial things going on here - the negative sign . This means that the range goes from 0 to 14 , rather than from -14 to 0 . Like so many things in science , we have to define a direction , even though it does n't really matter : we often pick the one that is warmest and fuzziest ( 0 to 14 seems really nice , right ? ) and as long as you can learn and know that a low pH indicates more [ H+ ] than [ OH- ] , i.e. indicates acidic behaviour , then you can use and apply the pH scale as you wish . Hope this helps - please reply if you need anything clearing up ! EDIT : Cleared up formatting issues ."", 'pH is a log scale , so an increase of 1 pH corresponds to a larger than 1 decrease ( higher pH = more basic = less H+ ) in concentration of H+ ions .', 'pH values are determined by the concentration of protons or H+ ions in solution .

Explain like I'm five.,"['pH stands for ""potential of hydrogen"" and is a measure of the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of a solution. The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral. A solution with a pH less than 7 is considered acidic, while a solution with a pH greater than 7 is considered basic or alkaline.\r\n\r\nThe reason why a change in pH by one unit (for example, going from pH 7 to pH 8) is not considered a ""simple"" increase by one is because the pH scale is logarithmic. This means that each unit on the pH scale represents a tenfold difference in acidity or basicity. For example, a solution with a pH of 4 is ten times more acidic than a solution with a pH of 5, and 100 times more acidic than a solution with a pH of 6. Similarly, a solution with a pH of 9 is ten times more basic than a solution with a pH of 8, and 100 times more basic than a solution with a pH of 7.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps!

It ranges from 0 to 14, with 0 being the most acidic, 7 being neutral, and 14 being the most basic. When the pH of a substance increases by 1, this means that it has become ten times more basic. For example, if a substance goes from pH 7 to pH 8, it means that it has become ten times more basic. If a substance goes from pH 4 to pH 5, it means that it has become ten times more acidic. So when the pH of a substance changes by 1, it represents a change of an order of magnitude. Does that make sense?']",1
How do PH values actually work ? Why should ( for example ) going from ph7 to ph8 not to be considered an increase by 1 but an increase as an order of magnitude ? Hope my question makes sense . Please explain like I'm five.,"[""When we use acids in water , we like to compare the concentration of protons [ H+ ] . A really important concept when thinking about aqueous acids and bases is a physical constant called Kw , it 's 1x10 ^ -14 , and it is defined as [ H+][OH- ] , i.e the concentration of protons multiplied by the concentration of hydroxyl ( OH- ) ions . This allows us to easily convert between [ OH- ] and [ H+ ] , as their product is constant . If we have a 1.0 M of HCl , then we might anticipate that that will fully break up into H+ and Cl- , giving us [ H+]=1.0M. If we have 1.0 M of NaOH , then we might expect that to fully break up into Na+ and OH- . We want to be able to compare the acidity of the solutions though , so we can convert [ OH-]=1.0 into a value of [ H+ ] using Kw . [ H+ ] = Kw/[OH- ] Giving us , for 1.0 M NaOH , [ H+ ] = 1x10 ^ -14 . Now , 1 and 1x10 ^ -14 are very different numbers , and we 're humans - we like numbers that we can think about , like 6 or 12 or 241 . So we can squeeze this entire range into a much ' nicer ' range of numbers ( 0 to 14 - but I 'll explain that ) . In order to compress this range of orders of magnitude we must use a logarithmic scale . All this means is that when go from pH 1 to ph 2 , we are changing an order of magnitude , not a single digit . The process of taking the logarithm of a number means that you are asking the question ' What power do I have to raise 10 to in order to get this number ' i.e log(10 ^ 6 ) = 6 . pH is defined as -log[H+ ] . There are non - trivial things going on here - the negative sign . This means that the range goes from 0 to 14 , rather than from -14 to 0 . Like so many things in science , we have to define a direction , even though it does n't really matter : we often pick the one that is warmest and fuzziest ( 0 to 14 seems really nice , right ? ) and as long as you can learn and know that a low pH indicates more [ H+ ] than [ OH- ] , i.e. indicates acidic behaviour , then you can use and apply the pH scale as you wish . Hope this helps - please reply if you need anything clearing up ! EDIT : Cleared up formatting issues ."", 'pH is a log scale , so an increase of 1 pH corresponds to a larger than 1 decrease ( higher pH = more basic = less H+ ) in concentration of H+ ions .', 'pH values are determined by the concentration of protons or H+ ions in solution .

How do Penny Auctions make money ? Searched here and did n't find an answer . :/ Explain like I'm five.,"[""Penny auctions are a type of online auction where users can bid on items by paying a small fee for each bid. The winning bidder gets the item at a price that is typically much lower than its retail value.\n\nPenny auctions make money by charging users a fee for each bid they make. For example, if a user wants to bid on an item that is being sold for $100, they might have to pay a fee of $0.50 for each bid they make. If they make 10 bids, they would have to pay a total of $5.00 in fees.\n\nThe penny auction website makes a profit because the total amount of money that users pay in fees is usually greater than the final sale price of the item. For example, if the winning bid on an item is $20 and the total amount of money paid in fees is $50, the penny auction website would make a profit of $30.\n\nIt's important to note that penny auctions can be risky for users because they can end up paying a lot of money in fees without winning the auction.

The scheme will eventually collapse because there are not enough new members to support the upper layers.It is illegal in many countries, including the United States, to operate or participate in a pyramid scheme. Despite this, some people still try to operate pyramid schemes or fall victim to them because they believe they can make easy money. However, these schemes are often unsustainable and can result in financial losses for the people who participate in them.It is important to be cautious and do research before investing in any opportunity, and to be wary of any opportunity that requires you to recruit new members in order to make money.

"How do SSD 's work as opposed to HDD 's ? I know that HDD 's are mechanical and SSD 's are all digital , but how exactly does a SSD work ? Explain like I'm five.","['As you probably know , a typical HDD uses * magnets * and * motors * to capture and store data . This has been a really great method for many years , but - as with all moving parts - they eventually start to break down . SSDs address this issue by using * electrical current * instead of hinges and gears , etc . But * how * do they do it ? * * TRANSISTORS ! * * A "" transistor "" is basically a semiconductor that can accept / reject electrical signals . If the transistor accepts an electrical current , it is represented as 1 . If the transistor * is not * accepting an electrical current , it is represented as 0 . This is great , because it perfectly aligns with the computer language of binary , which represents * everything * as a gigantic series of 1s and 0s . It \'s a \' hand in glove \' moment of serendipity . A blank SSD will start with ( mostly ) 1s --- remember this means they can all accept current . When you add a piece of data , it is converted to binary , then converted into electrical currents , and this essentially realigns the transistors . Some of the 1s will then be switched to 0s , and it \'s simply a matter of creating the "" right pattern "" in the transistors , so they accurately reflect the binary code that is being sent . It \'s really just a form of translation , like English to German ( sort of ) , except driven by electricity . If you want to be technical , yes , this is still essentially a form of "" moving "" , but it is * so small * ( i.e. : microscopic scale ) that it does n\'t present quite the same clunky problems . Of course , even transistors will eventually wear out if you \' switch \' them enough , so you may need to replace the SSD at some point in time . But it is a rather large number ( I ca n\'t recall exactly , but I believe it is in the thousands ) , and the average user is unlikely to exceed this in practical circumstances . With all that said : * do n\'t * rely on an SSD ( or an HDD , or anything else ) as your sole source of content control . Even the greatest technology can break down and malfunction . Get a backup device , or use some cloud storage ( e.g. : DropBox / SkyDrive ) .', ""A Hard Disk Drive ( HDD ) uses metallic platter disks with millions of concentric data rings written onto them to record data . Those platters spin at several thousand RPM with a Read / Write head floating over and beneath each platter ( Normally there are 3 - 5 platters ) . To write data , the Read / Write head , or brush , will deposit a magnetic dipole on a spot of the platter . Since this thing is spinning in a circle , the unrolled circle looks like a line of data . Because magnetic dipoles have a North and a South pole , the orientation of the magnetic dipole determines whether you are writing a 0 or a 1 . So , HDDs are magnetic spinning disks with data circles written in , with a Read / write brush that floats to where your data is and either reads N - S for 1 or S - N for 0 . The location on the disk is found with a look up table and a lot of complex robotics . NOW SSDs are way simpler . So , you have RAM in your computer , right ? RAM is simply transistors set up in a special way to hold and dump data real fast . What a SSD ( Solid State Drive ) does , is takes the concept or RAM ( Dynamic memory , memory that changes all the time ) and makes it static , so it does n't need to change all the time . To do this , you set up transistors in what s called a flip - flop . To do this , you put two NAND gates facing each other ( Look up the logic gate NAND to understAND ) . When you put a 1 into it , it will hold a 1 . When you ground a flip flop , you get a 0 and hold that 0 . So , what you do is , you make a GIANT GRID of flip flops . stretch tens of thousands one way , tens of thousands another , and then a couple thousand deep . Now you have a ton of places to hold data . In SSDs , you set up an array of data points that can be communicated with through a look up table and controller . Controllers opperate SUPER fast , and the time it takes to switch or read a flip - flop is on the order of 1 ^ -9 seconds . SO , this is way faster , no moving parts , and no inertial loads to handle . VERY DIFFERENT TECH .

An SSD, or Solid State Drive, is a type of storage device that uses memory chips to store data. It\'s called a ""solid state"" drive because it has no moving parts, unlike a hard disk drive (HDD) which uses spinning disks to store data.\r\n\r\nHere\'s how it works: When you save a file on an SSD, the data is stored on tiny chips called ""memory cells."" These cells are arranged in a grid, kind of like a big checkerboard. To read or write data, the SSD uses tiny electrical charges to turn the cells on or off. A cell that is ""on"" represents a 1, and a cell that is ""off"" represents a 0. By combining lots of these 1s and 0s, the SSD can store all kinds of information, like documents, pictures, and music.\r\n\r\nOne of the advantages of an SSD is that it can access and transfer data very quickly because there are no moving parts to slow it down. This makes it faster than an HDD, which has to physically locate the right part of the spinning disk to access the data.\r\n\r\nI hope that helps explain how an SSD works!

How do Tariffs Work ? How do Tariffs Work ? Who pays the Tariff Tax ? What happens to countries that have Tariffs imposed against them ? Explain like I'm five.,"['Tariffs are taxes that are placed on imported goods. They are usually put in place by the government of a country in order to protect domestic industries and businesses. For example, if a country has a lot of car manufacturers, the government might put a tariff on imported cars in order to make them more expensive for people to buy. This would make domestic cars more competitive, because they would not be taxed as much.\n\nThe people who pay the tariff tax are the people who buy the imported goods. If a tariff is placed on a product that you want to buy, you will have to pay extra for it because of the tax. The money from the tariff goes to the government of the country that imposed it.\n\nCountries that have tariffs imposed against them may find it more difficult to sell their products in other countries. This is because the products they sell will be more expensive due to the tariffs, and people in the other country may be less likely to buy them.

How do UK Gilts interest rates and repayments work?,"['UK Gilts are government bonds issued by the British government. They are debt securities that pay periodic interest to bondholders and return the principal when the bonds mature. The interest rate on a Gilt is called the ""coupon rate,"" and it is fixed at the time the Gilt is issued. The coupon rate determines the amount of interest that the Gilt will pay to its holders.Gilts are issued with a range of maturities, from a few years to several decades. When a Gilt matures, the government pays back the principal (the original amount of the loan) to the bondholder. In the meantime, the bondholder receives periodic interest payments based on the coupon rate.The interest on Gilts is paid twice a year, and the payments are taxed as income. Gilts are considered to be a very low-risk investment because they are backed by the full faith and credit of the British government. As a result, they typically offer lower yields than other types of bonds with similar maturities.I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.', 'UK Gilts are government bonds issued by the UK Treasury to raise funds for the government. The interest rate on a Gilt is the amount of money that the government promises to pay the bondholder for lending them the money. The interest on a Gilt is paid to the bondholder on a regular basis, usually twice a year. The frequency of interest payments and the amount of interest paid is stated in the terms of the bond.The principal, or the initial amount of money that the bondholder lends to the government, is paid back to the bondholder when the bond matures, or reaches its end date. The maturity date is also stated in the terms of the bond.The interest rate on a Gilt is determined by a number of factors, including the current economic environment and the perceived creditworthiness of the UK government. The interest rate on a Gilt may be fixed or variable. A fixed-rate Gilt pays a set amount of interest for the entire term of the bond, while a variable-rate Gilt pays an interest rate that can fluctuate over time.I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.']",1
How do UK Gilts interest rates and repayments work?,"['The name of the Gilt states the redemption date, but not the original issue date. A gilt with 8.75% yield and close to its redemption date may have been issued at a time when interest rates were indeed close to 8.75%. For example in the early 1990s, the UK inflation rate was about 8%. One reason for preferring high or low coupon gilts is the trade off between capital gains and income, and the different taxation rules for each. If you buy a gilt and hold it to its maturity date, you know in advance the exact price that it will be redeemed for (i.e. £100). You may prefer to take a high level of income now, knowing you will make a capital loss in future (which might offset some other predictable capital gain for tax purposes) or you may prefer not to take income that you don\'t need right now, and instead get a guaranteed capital gain in future (for example, when you plan to retire from work). Also, you can use the change in the market value of gilts as a gamble or a hedge against your expectation of interest rate changes in future, with the ""government guaranteed"" fallback position that if your predictions are wrong, you know exactly what return you will get if you hold the gilts to maturity. The same idea applies to other bond investments - but without the government guarantee, of course.']",0

They are made up of workers who come together to negotiate with their employer for things like better pay, safer working conditions, and better benefits.

These heads are magnetically charged and can read the magnetic signals on the tape. As the tape moves past the heads, the signals are converted into an electrical current, which is then amplified and played through the speakers of the VHS player. \nThe audio on a VHS tape is typically recorded in a format called ""analog audio,"" which means that the audio is stored as a continuous, wave-like signal on the tape. This is different from ""digital audio,"" which stores audio as a series of 1s and 0s. When you play a VHS tape, the audio is read from the tape and converted into sound waves that you can hear through the speakers. \nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.']",1

It uses a database of many different things, such as characters from movies and TV shows, animals, and objects. When you start the game, Akinator asks you to think of something, and then it begins to ask you a series of questions. These questions are designed to help Akinator narrow down the possible options and figure out what you are thinking of. For example, it might ask if the thing you are thinking of is a person or an animal, or if it is real or fictional. As you answer the questions, Akinator uses the information you provide to eliminate some of the options in its database. For example, if you say that the thing you are thinking of is a real animal, Akinator will eliminate all of the fictional animals from its list of possibilities. This process continues until Akinator thinks it has figured out what you are thinking of. Akinator is able to guess even obscure things because it has a very large database of things to choose from. The more things it has in its database, the more likely it is to be able to guess what you are thinking of.']",1
How do Women 's menstrual cycles synchronise ? Is it actually proven to happen ? And what is actually physically happening for the synchronisation to occur ? There are other posts on the subject but no one explains how or shows any real proof . Explain like I'm five.,"['It is not uncommon for women who live or work closely together to report that their menstrual cycles become synchronized, meaning that their periods start around the same time. This is known as the ""McClintock effect,"" after Martha McClintock, who first published research on this phenomenon in 1971. However, it is still not fully understood how or why this occurs. One theory is that pheromones, which are chemical signals produced by the body, may play a role in synchronizing menstrual cycles. Pheromones can be detected by the sense of smell and may affect the behavior or physiology of other people. For example, the smell of a woman\'s pheromones may affect the menstrual cycles of other women who are exposed to them. However, more research is needed to confirm this theory. It\'s important to note that not all women\'s menstrual cycles will become synchronized, and it\'s not uncommon for cycles to vary in length from one woman to another. Also, it\'s not necessary for menstrual cycles to be synchronized in order for women to live and work together effectively.']",1

"How do Young Earth Creationists rationalize radiocarbon dating ? Not trying to stir the pot , just genuinely curious about how they do it . Since it is based on relatively simple math , and relatively simple science , on what basis do they reject it ? Please explain like I'm five.","[""Radiocarbon dating is a technique that uses the decay of carbon-14 to determine the age of organic materials, such as wood or bones. It is based on the fact that carbon-14 is constantly being created in the Earth's atmosphere through the interaction of cosmic rays with nitrogen atoms. When an organism dies, it stops taking in carbon-14, and the carbon-14 in its body begins to decay at a predictable rate. By measuring the amount of carbon-14 in a sample and comparing it to the known decay rate of carbon-14, scientists can determine how old the sample is. Young Earth creationists, who believe that the Earth is only a few thousand years old, may reject radiocarbon dating because it produces ages that are much older than this. They may argue that the decay rate of carbon-14 has changed over time, or that the sample has been contaminated with older carbon. However, these arguments are not supported by scientific evidence and are not widely accepted by the scientific community. It is important to note that radiocarbon dating is just one of many methods that scientists use to determine the age of materials. Other methods, such as potassium-argon dating and uranium-lead dating, have been developed to provide additional information about the age of materials and help scientists confirm the results of radiocarbon dating.""]",1

So we 're just going to talk about thrust and drag . In order for a plane to fly it has to have air moving over its wings . This means that you have to have something pushing the plane , usually a propeller or a jet engine . Once the plane starts moving air starts hitting the plane and pushing back against it . This is called drag . At lower altitudes the air is thicker so drag is higher . Climbing to a higher altitude means the engines do n't have to work nearly as hard because there 's less air pushing back against the plane . As a result , planes can fly faster and farther than they can at lower levels . In addition , pilots will also climb to higher altitudes so they can fly over storms or other weather that might make it harder to fly ."", '[ Searched ] ( URL_0 ) Relevant [ discussion ] ( URL_3 ) Original text by [ borntoperform ] ( URL_2 ) > Explain like I \'m actually a five year old playing around with a model airplane , and I ask you how , "" How do planes weigh so much but are able to fly in the sky ? "" Relevant comment courtesy [ Yondee ] ( URL_1 ) > Alrighty little Jimmy ! Let \'s take a look at this model airplane you have . It is pretty neat right ? There are some specific pieces of the plane that are very important to it staying in the air . The first , obviously are the wings , but in order to understand the wings we need to make sure you understand the propeller . > Boy it is hot out ! Thank goodness we have that nice ceiling fan going . Do you notice how the ceiling fan is pushing air around Johnny ? Because the blades are angled it pushes the air down as the fan moves around in a circle right ? So we can picture the fan working like this : > * As the fan spins air is caught by the edge of the fan , the air is forced under the blade . > * Since the fan is still spinning and "" gathering "" more air on the top edge this new air pushes the air that was caught first down . > * This continues and the air flows down the edge of the blade until the edges stops . > * The air does n\'t stop there though . There no more pushing due to the fan blade , but the other air that is still being pushed by the fan blade pushes the air further downward . > * Now there is a nice breeze of cool air that reaches us as we look at this model plane , pretty neat huh Jack ? > Propellers are just fans that are sideways . They spin and push the air that is in front of them behind them . Propellers push much more air than our ceiling fan though . Since they push so much air in one direction they end up moving the plane in the opposite direction , that \'s how planes move forward . You still with me Billy ? > Now that you understand how the propeller works we can talk about the wings . As you can see , the wings are shaped very similar to the blades on our fan and on the propeller . Let \'s pretend our propeller is already running and we are on a very long runway . We start moving very fast . Our wings start working exactly like the fan blades pushing the air downward as we move forward . Now , exactly as the propeller forced air behind it to go forward , the wings are forcing air down to move up . WAKE UP BERNARD , I\'M STILL TALKING ! ! > That is how a plane works . The smarty - pants who designed them figured out how to move the air backwards and downwards in order to make the plane go forward and up . Okay Sebastian , I hope you learned a lot . Now go outside and play with your plane , your mother and I have some "" work "" to do .', 'Planes fly by using "" lift . "" Lift is created by a nifty little shape called an airfoil . If you look at an airfoil in a cross - section view , it looks like a horizontal teardrop , but the top is curved more than the bottom ( sometimes the bottom is flat and only the top is curved . ) The principle at work here is that , as this shape moves through the air , the air is split ( think of air as a liquid ) and moves across the top and bottom of the airfoil . However , since the top of the airfoil is curved more than the bottom , the air that travels over the top of the airfoil has farther to travel ( like walking in a straight line as opposed to walking in a curve to get to the same destination ) . Since it has farther to travel , it has to go faster ( like walking in a straight line as opposed to walking in a curve to get to the same destination at the same exact time ) . Since air goes faster over the top of the airfoil , a sort of vacuum is created underneath the airfoil , where the slower - moving air is . This is lift ; it pushes the airfoil shape up from below . So , an airplane \'s wing is just a big airfoil , creating the lift needed to counteract the drag ( friction and stuff of an object moving through the air ) of the airplane and take flight ! All planes follow these principles , but there are many different kinds of propulsion that planes use to get moving fast enough to make the airfoil work ( propellers , jet engines , turbojets , rockets ) . The engine does n\'t make a plane fly though , it just makes the plane move fast enough for the airfoil to create enough lift for the plane to fly . As for why planes fly high , there are many reasons . First , the air is thinner up high , so airplanes are more efficient ( less drag , lift has a greater effect , uses less fuel , travel faster ) . Also , they can fly above most weather , which means no storms or unpredictable wind to deal with . The jet stream and other global wind currents high in the sky also make it worthwhile to catch a ride ( just like the current in Finding Nemo ! ) .']",0
How do airplanes fly and why do they travel at high altitudes ? Would n't it be less of a distance to travel closer to the surface of the earth rather than 35000 feet ? Explain like I'm five.,"['Sure! Airplanes fly by using lift, which is a force that pushes the airplane up into the air. Lift is created when air flows over and under the wings of the airplane. The shape of the wings is carefully designed to create lift and keep the airplane in the air.\n\nAirplanes fly at high altitudes for a few reasons. First, the air at high altitudes is much thinner, so there is less resistance, or drag, which makes it easier for the airplane to fly. Second, flying at high altitudes also allows airplanes to avoid bad weather, such as clouds and thunderstorms, which can make flying difficult and dangerous. Finally, flying at high altitudes can also help airplanes save fuel because the thin air requires less power to fly through.\n\nWhile it might seem like it would be shorter to fly closer to the surface of the earth, there are a few reasons why this is not always the case. First, flying closer to the ground can be more difficult because there is more drag, or resistance, from the air. Second, flying lower can also increase the risk of running into obstacles, such as mountains and tall buildings. Finally, flying at high altitudes allows airplanes to take advantage of strong, steady winds that can help them travel faster and more efficiently.']",1

The ones that "" fall out "" of orbit do so because they \'re in low orbit where the upper fringes of the atmosphere gradually slow them down .

When satellites are launched and put in orbit , they have a certain "" lifetime "" that they can operate at . This is dictated by the amount of fuel on board they can use for control . Basically when the orbit starts to decay ( due to gravity pulling the satellite into the Earth ) , they burn some fuel and push it farther out again . When they \'re almost out of fuel , they retire the satellite either by pushing it out of orbit / into a high orbit where it more or less is left to the elements , or they control the descent and allow it to fall to Earth where it \'s not going to hurt anyone ( although usually they do n\'t do this unless there \'s especially valuable data or materials on board ) .', ""Satellites are initially launched into an orbit that is planned so as not to collide with other objects .

Objects fall out of orbit because they are constantly being tugged on by gravity from different bodies , and also slow down due to drag from the atmosphere . Most satellites orbiting the Earth are n't actually outside the Earth 's atmosphere , they orbit inside the exosphere or thermosphere , which drags at the satellite and slows it down . To combat this , satellites either have an engine that allows them to periodically boost back into the correct orbit , or they just have a planned lifetime that takes into account the degrading orbit . Satellites that are past their useful lifespan are also often intentionally de - orbited so they do n't just sit out there taking up space .""]",0
"How do all the clocks in the world stay synchronized ? With different time zones and so many clocks , how do we keep our time straight ?

To say those clocks are "" synchronized "" with another clock implies that they \'re close enough to each other so you do n\'t notice the difference between them — less than a minute , by far , and possibly less than a second depending on exactly what kind of clock we \'re talking about . But nobody in the world needs their wristwatch and the clock in their car to be within a second of each other . If they \'re within * ten minutes * of each other , that \'s absolutely fine … and frankly , as long as they \'re within a half hour , it \'s probably not * that * big a deal . So when the battery in your watch dies and you have to reset it , what do you do ? You just look at another clock .

You can tell the local time precisely by observing the sky and doing some math based on the date and your location ( latitude ) . The easiest observation is the position of the sun in the sky . 2 . You can tell the local time at a different location if you know your local time and your location ( longitude ) . So it \'s possible for any location that has an observatory and accurate measurements of its own longitude and latitude to determine what the correct solar time is at any other location on Earth . This is the reason why the agencies responsible for telling the standard time are called "" observatories , "" because telling the time precisely used to mean observing the sky carefully . Two example observatories : * [ United States Naval Observatory ] ( URL_2 ) * The United Kingdom \'s [ Royal Observatory , Greenwich ] ( URL_0 ) . This one is the historically most important one ; we measure longitude relative to this observatory \'s location . Historically , businesses or government agencies that need accurate time got it either directly or indirectly from an observatory . Observatories provide time services that you can use to set a clock . For example , some observatories run special radio stations dedicated to nothing other than broadcasting the time . The USNO runs a [ telephone service ] ( URL_1 ) where you can call an automated voice announcer with accurate time . In the late 19th century and early 20th , railroads were an important means of communicating the standard time . Railroad safety requires accurate clocks , so railroad lines built mechanisms for transmitting the official time to their stations , often with electric systems . So in those days you could set your clock accurately by looking at the train station \'s clocks . After the 1950s things get a bit more complicated , because of the invention of atomic clocks . [ juxtap0zed \'s answer ] ( URL_3 ) explains those ; what it means is that the standard time is no longer directly tied to the rotation of the Earth , but measured with atomic clocks that are more precise than this rotation . The official atomic clocks are operated by a group of observatories in several countries . And since the 1990s there have been two important new ways of getting accurate time : 1 . GPS satellites are atomic clocks that broadcast their time . A GPS receiver can get extremely accurate time . 2 . Many types of cell phone technology rely on having accurate time as well . So it \'s possible to get accurate time by building a machine that listens in to cell phone towers . ( This does n\'t mean that cell phones automatically get accurate time in their clocks ; for example , I \'ve seen my iPhone off by as much as 1.5 seconds from the standard time . )', 'there are official world wide time keepers and they tell people all over the world what time it is .

Clocks in different time zones stay synchronized by using something called Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). This is a time standard that is used all around the world and it is based on the Earth's rotation.\n\nWhen it is noon in UTC, it is also noon in all of the other time zones around the world. However, since the Earth is round, different parts of the Earth are facing the Sun at different times. That's why we have different time zones. For example, when it is noon in UTC, it might be 7:00 AM in New York (which is in the Eastern Time Zone) because the Sun is just starting to rise there.\n\nTo keep all of the clocks in the world synchronized, we use something called a time signal. This is a special radio signal that is sent out from a very accurate clock, called a time standard. The time standard is a very accurate clock that is kept in a special place where the temperature and other conditions are kept very stable. This helps the clock stay accurate.\n\nMost regular clocks, like the one on your phone or the one on your wall, are accurate to within a few seconds. Some clocks are even more accurate and can keep time to within a fraction of a second. However, no clock is perfect and they all lose or gain a little bit of time over time. That's why it's important to set your clock once in a while to make sure it is showing the correct time.""]",1
How do amortization schedules work and when are they used?,"['Simply put, for a mortgage, interest is charged only on the balance as well. Think of it this way - on a $100K 6% loan, on day one, 1/2% is $500, and the payment is just under $600, so barely $100 goes to principal. But the last payment of $600 is nearly all principal.  By the way, you are welcome to make extra principal payments along with the payment due each month. An extra $244 in this example, paid each and every month, will drop the term to just 15 years. Think about that, 40% higher payment, all attacking the principal, and you cut the term by 1/2 the time.']",0
How do amortization schedules work and when are they used?,"['An amortization schedule is a table or schedule showing the periodic payments on a loan, including the amount of principal and the amount of interest that make up each payment until the loan is fully paid off. The schedule typically shows the balance of the loan after each payment, so you can see how the balance decreases over time as the loan is paid off.Amortization schedules are commonly used for loans such as mortgages, car loans, and student loans. These types of loans typically have a fixed term, with fixed periodic payments that are made over the course of the loan. Each payment consists of a portion of the principal (the original amount of the loan) and a portion of the interest (the cost of borrowing the money). As the loan is paid off, the amount of each payment that goes toward the principal increases and the amount that goes toward interest decreases.To create an amortization schedule, you need to know the following information:The total amount of the loan (the principal)The interest rate on the loanThe term of the loan (how long the loan will be in effect)The frequency of the payments (monthly, biweekly, etc.)Using this information, you can create an amortization schedule that shows the breakdown of each payment into principal and interest, as well as the remaining balance of the loan after each payment. You can use an online amortization calculator or spreadsheet to create an amortization schedule, or you can create one manually using a pen and paper.Amortization schedules can be useful for helping you understand how your loan will be paid off and how much you will pay in total over the life of the loan. They can also be helpful for budgeting and planning, as you can see how much of each payment is going toward the principal and how much is going toward interest.']",1

When an animal hibernates, its body slows down and it doesn't need to eat or drink as much. Its heart rate and breathing also slow down, so the animal doesn't use up as much energy. During hibernation, the animal's body temperature also drops. This helps it to conserve energy because it doesn't have to use as much energy to keep warm.

The retina contains light-sensitive cells called rods and cones, which send signals to the brain when they are stimulated by light. The brain then processes these signals and creates an image of what the animal is seeing. In animals with independent eyes, each eye has its own lens, retina, and set of rods and cones. This means that each eye is able to send separate signals to the brain, which allows the animal to see two different things at the same time.

How do annual risks translate into long-term risks?,"['Annual risks are risks that occur on an annual basis, while long-term risks are risks that may occur over a longer period of time, such as several years or decades. The relationship between annual risks and long-term risks is complex and depends on many factors, including the nature of the risk, the likelihood of it occurring, and the potential impact of the risk.For example, an annual risk might be a risk of a natural disaster occurring in a particular region. If this risk occurs every year, then it could be considered a long-term risk as well. On the other hand, if the risk of the natural disaster occurring is low, or if the potential impact of the disaster is limited, then it might not be considered a long-term risk.On the other hand, a long-term risk might be a risk of technological disruption, such as the adoption of new technologies that could disrupt existing industries or business models. This type of risk might not occur on an annual basis, but it could have significant long-term consequences for organizations that are unprepared for it.In general, it is important for organizations to consider both annual risks and long-term risks in order to plan for the future and mitigate the potential impact of these risks on their operations. This may involve conducting risk assessments, implementing risk management strategies, and continuously monitoring and reviewing risk exposures.']",1
How do annual risks translate into long-term risks?,"['The short answer is the annualised volatility over twenty years should be pretty much the same as the annualised volatility over five years. For independent, identically distributed returns the volatility scales proportionally. So for any number of monthly returns T, setting the annualization factor m = 12 annualises the volatility.  It should be the same for all time scales.  However, note the discussion here: https://quant.stackexchange.com/a/7496/7178 Scaling volatility [like this] only is mathematically correct when the   underlying price model is driven by Geometric Brownian motion which   implies that prices are log normally distributed and returns are   normally distributed. Particularly the comment: ""its a well known fact that volatility is overestimated when scaled over long periods of time without a change of model to estimate such ""long-term"" volatility."" Now, a demonstration.  I have modelled 12,000 monthly returns with mean = 3% and standard deviation = 2, so the annualised volatility should be Sqrt(12) * 2 = 6.9282.   Calculating annualised volatility for return sequences of various lengths (3, 6, 12, 60 months etc.) reveals an inaccuracy for shorter sequences.  The five-year sequence average got closest to the theoretically expected figure (6.9282), and, as the commenter noted ""volatility is [slightly] overestimated when scaled over long periods of time"". Annualised volatility for varying return sequence lengths  Edit re. comment Reinvesting returns does not affect the volatility much.  For instance, comparing some data I have handy, the Dow Jones Industrial Average Capital Returns (CR) versus Net Returns (NR).  The return differences are somewhat smoothed, 0.1% each month, 0.25% every third month.  More erratic dividend reinvestment would increase the volatility.']",0

Explain like I'm five.","[""Ants are able to survive falls that would be very dangerous for humans because they have a number of adaptations that help them to protect themselves. First of all, ants are very small, which means that they have a smaller surface area and less mass, so they experience less force when they fall. This means that they don't hit the ground as hard as a larger animal like a human would. Secondly, ants have a hard exoskeleton, which is a hard outer shell that covers their body. This exoskeleton helps to protect them from injury when they fall, because it absorbs some of the force of the impact. Finally, ants are able to move their legs and antennae very quickly when they fall, which helps them to orient themselves in mid-air and land on their feet. This helps them to absorb the impact of the fall and reduce the chance of injury. So, when an ant falls from a high place, it is able to survive because it is small, has a hard exoskeleton, and can move its legs and antennae quickly to help it land safely.""]",1

"How do apps like shazam and soundhound work ? Once they listen to the song , how do they find out what song it is ? Do they find like a matching audio file or something like that ? Explain like I'm five.","['I do n\'t know about Soundhound , but for Shazam specifically , here is how it works ( or at least did a few years ago when I read about this ) ; As the Shazam app records the song , it will split it up into short blocks of time . Within each period of time , it will figure out what frequency is the loudest . Assuming that the music is the loudest thing happening , this does an excellent job of filtering out any background noise and quiet notes that may be imperceptible to a crappy cell phone microphone . It does n\'t matter if people are talking or a door opens or if your cell mic ca n\'t pick out that exquisite bass guitar in the background -- only the loudest thing matters . The result is a "" fingerprint "" of the song --- a list of the loudest frequencies versus time for a short fragment . The frequencies are rounded off here , because 14224 kHz is not going to be distinguishable from 14000 kHz for the purposes of Shazam and your crappy cell mic . Because you obviously do n\'t record the entire song , the actual fingerprint you get on your phone will be a subset of the complete fingerprint of the song . Like this ( random letters used to represent frequencies ) Full song : ABAJUKARWA Clip : UKA ( Note that , at this point , Shazam does n\'t know that the clip and the full song are associated , much less where in the full song the clip appears , but they are presented together for demonstration ) . Note that the fingerprint from your mic is actually pretty close to the real one , even though you just held your crappy cell phone towards the mall speaker for ten seconds . That is for a few reasons : 1 . As previously mentioned , only the loudest sounds are used 2 . Because you \'re not listening to radio static , the song at 59.2 seconds sounds really similar to the song at 59.3 seconds . Therefore the impact of your time intervals not necessarily being aligned with the "" official "" time intervals is reduced . Now , Shazam has invested a lot of money into buying studio music and fingerprinting entire albums . So they have an enormous database of songs and their associated complete fingerprints ( what the loudest sounds are in each small time fragment for the entire song ) . Your phone uploads the fingerprint it took to the Shazam server . Shazam uses a proprietary fuzzy matching algorithm to very quickly search their huge database of fingerprints for portions that are very close to your fingerprint . They do n\'t use an exact match ; they actually use a line similarity algorithm . Basically , imagine the full song as an XY graph with time as X and loudest frequency in that time fragment as Y. Your clip is a small part of that graph . Under studio conditions the lines would be exactly identical . On a crappy cell mic , they wo n\'t be , but : 1 . They will be quite close ( if the song \'s loudest frequency is 20kHz at some point , your mic might might be a frequency band or so up or down , but it \'s not going to be 7kHz ) 2 . They will have the same patterns of rise and fall , 3 . If there are deviations due to loud noises , they will be short ( maybe someone talked or a door opened , but that \'s just a big blip and then it goes back to normal ) . Using these three facts , Shazam is able to do a really , really good job of identifying what song your clip came from , and where . And then it sends back the result ! :)', 'It \'s like a fingerprint . Shazam has a huge library of songs for which it has already analyzed the frequencies and created a "" digital fingerprint , "" like a [ spectrogram ] ( URL_0 ) . When you use it to identify a song , it performs this same analysis on the music it \'s "" listening "" to and compares the results to its library to find the song that matches . Like a human fingerprint , a particular song will have a unique pattern of frequencies , which is why it usually only needs to "" hear "" a small clip in order to narrow it down enough find the matching song .', ""Most likely it analyzes the piece of sound waves you make it listen to , and compares that real time with a database full of songs and sound waves . I 'm no expert in this field , but there are tons of algorithms designed to understand music better , so I 'm sure Shazam and Soundhound got a hold of those algorithms .""]",0

These chemicals are combined in specific amounts to try to replicate the taste of a real strawberry as closely as possible.\\n\\nThe process of creating artificial flavorings can be complex and requires a lot of knowledge and skill. Flavorists have to understand how different chemicals interact with each other and how they will be perceived by the human tongue. They also have to consider how the flavor will be used – for example, whether it will be added to a drink, a candy, or a baked good – and how it will be affected by other ingredients or by heat.\\n\\nOverall, the goal of artificial flavorings is to create a substance that tastes like a particular food or drink, without actually using the real thing. This can be useful in situations where the real food is not available or is too expensive, or when it is difficult to get the desired flavor using natural ingredients.']",1

First, they wear special earplugs or earmuffs that help to block out some of the noise. These earplugs or earmuffs are made of materials that are designed to absorb sound waves and reduce the amount of noise that reaches the eardrums. Second, the inside of the spacecraft is designed to be very sturdy and able to withstand the vibrations and noise of the launch. The walls of the spacecraft are thick and made of materials that are able to absorb some of the sound waves and reduce the amount of noise that reaches the astronauts. Finally, the astronauts are also seated in a special area of the spacecraft that is designed to be as quiet as possible. This helps to reduce the amount of noise that they are exposed to during the launch.

How do astronomers know the size and distance of planets / stars / galaxies ? It always boggled my mind when they display the epic sized numbers when describing distances and size of space things ... Explain like I'm five.,"['Great question! Astronomers have developed a number of techniques to measure the sizes and distances of celestial objects, such as planets, stars, and galaxies.\n\nOne way to measure the size of an object is to use something called ""angular size."" Angular size is the size of an object as it appears from Earth, measured in degrees. For example, the angular size of the Moon as seen from Earth is about 0.5 degrees, which is about the same as the angular size of your little finger held at arm\'s length. By measuring the angular size of an object and knowing its distance from us, we can calculate the actual size of the object.\n\nAnother way to measure distance is to use something called ""parallax."" Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of an object due to a change in the observer\'s position. For example, if you hold your finger in front of your face and close one eye, then open that eye and close the other eye, your finger will appear to shift relative to the background. Astronomers use this same principle to measure the distances to nearby stars. By measuring the amount of shift in a star\'s position over the course of a year, we can calculate its distance from Earth.\n\nThere are many other techniques that astronomers use to measure the sizes and distances of celestial objects, such as using the brightness of stars to determine their distance, or using the redshift of galaxies to measure their speed and distance. These techniques can be a bit more complex, but they all rely on basic principles of physics and mathematics to help us understand the vastness of the universe.']",1

"How do audio and video codecs work , and why do we need them ? I 'd like to gain a basic understanding of audio and video codecs . Explain like I'm five.","[""Sure! An audio codec is a piece of software that is used to compress and decompress audio files. Audio files, like songs or recordings of people talking, can be very large, so codecs are used to make them smaller and easier to store or transmit. Video codecs work in a similar way, but they are used to compress and decompress video files. Video files, like movies or TV shows, can be even larger than audio files, so codecs are especially important for storing and transmitting them. We need audio and video codecs because it's not practical to store or transmit large audio and video files without compressing them first. For example, it would take a long time to download a movie over the internet if it wasn't compressed with a codec first. Codecs allow us to store and transmit audio and video more efficiently.""]",1
"How do audio and video codecs work , and why do we need them ? I 'd like to gain a basic understanding of audio and video codecs . Explain like I'm five.","['Do you want to know about the theory behind them , or about which ones are better in which situations and how to use them ? Video is a series of still images ( called * frames * ) played rapidly in a row . Most commonly , people will use 24 frames per second ( * 24fps * ) for video ; that \'s 24 still images played quickly enough that it seems like smooth motion . Each of these images is made up from many tiny coloured squares , called * pixels * . Think of a [ mosaic art piece ] ( URL_0 ) ; the more pieces of mosaic -- pixels -- you use , the more detailed the image can be . The number of pixels used in an image is called its * resolution * . To illustrate the differences in resolution : a DVD has 345,600 pixels per frame , HDTV has around 921,000 , and Blu - ray has over 2 million . For every second of video you see on a Bluray , the player is putting 49.76 million tiny coloured squares on the screen in a specific order . That \'s a * lot * of information . The player would have to say "" Put a red square first . Then a blue square . Then a yellow square . Then a green square "" to the TV almost 50 million times a second . When it \'s speaking in plain English like that , just saying what squares go where , we call it * uncompressed video * . Uncompressed Blu - ray video takes up 149.3 megabytes per second ( without even counting audio ) . * Codecs * are our solution to that problem . They * encode * the video -- that is , they turn that list of "" Put red square here "" plain - English instructions into a special kind of code that \'s a lot faster and takes less space to store . They will also change parts of the video to make it easier to describe in this code . One trick they might use is to keep non - moving portions of the screen static . Imagine your video is a Simpsons episode where Homer is mowing the lawn . Your uncompressed video , which does n\'t use a codec , will describe every single part of the scene 24 times per second , using a LOT of space . You use a clever codec that says "" Oh , look -- * Homer and the lawnmower * are moving , but the house stays perfectly still in the background . We \'ll describe the house once , and just say * keep that on the screen for 10 seconds * , so we do n\'t have to keep describing it over and over . "" You \'ve saved a lot of space that way . Likewise , while your uncompressed video describes Homer \'s face as "" yellow pixel , then yellow pixel , then yellow pixel , then yellow pixel "" over and over again a million times , your clever new codec would say "" Repeat yellow pixel 500 times "" , saving space . It might even say , depending on what codec you \'ve chosen and what settings it has , "" That tree in the background is made up of 500 shades of green , but let \'s trim that down to 300 shades , it wo n\'t look that much different but it \'ll save some more space . "" After enough of these tricks , your 900 GB video is down to 8 GB , small enough to put on a DVD . Why are there so many different codecs ? Well , it takes a lot of computer brainpower to process a video using an advanced codec . Back in 1990 , when computers were slow and computers were just starting out , they would \'ve made quite simple codecs that did n\'t take a million years for the computer to understand . Now in 2011 , because our computers are hundreds of times faster , we can write new codecs that employ very in - depth and complicated tricks . Our priorities have also changed -- now that we can stream videos online without worry , and now that we have 2 TB hard drives instead of 2 GB ones , we prefer to have big - but - pretty videos , while 1990s folks wanted to keep them as small as they possibly could . The codec used on DVDs is called MPEG-2 . MPEG-2 dates from 1996 , and was written with the goal of being decoded by cheap , low - power DVD players , so it \'s not very thorough or clever . The codec used on Blu - ray , iTunes video and many online sites is called H.264 or AVC . It is much newer , and was written knowing that it would be used on the strong computers of the late 2000s , rather than low - power devices from the mid-90s . As such , it is much smarter and more powerful -- because it knows it \'ll be played by powerful processors -- and provides a much higher quality of video . If you yourself are looking to encode video , the three most popular codec formats are * * MPEG-2 * * ( used only for DVDs nowadays ) , * * Xvid * * ( used in the AVI files you find online , good for making sure everyone can see it , or that it can be played on phones and other low - power devices ) and * * H.264 * * ( used for most online , Blu - ray , and HD videos ; the best choice in 95 % of cases ) . Now , as a footnote , let \'s note what a * container format * is . Many people are confused by this . Containers are things like AVI , MKV , or MP4 . These file extensions do not tell you what codec was used to make the video . Think of them more like ZIP files . Most video files contain the video , one or two audio tracks , maybe some subtitles , and some chapters . Each of those things is a separate piece , in a different format , messily separated . So you put them together into a * container * , one file that contains them all , just like ZIP . The exact same video can be represented inside an AVI , an MKV , or an MP4 , but they have different features . For example , AVI is 20 years old , made specially for Windows , and only really supports one video with one piece of audio on the top -- but everyone can view it . MKV is more modern , and supports multiple viewing angles , chapters like a DVD , built - in subtitles , multiple audio tracks ( so you can embed director \'s commentary or different languages ) , but because it \'s relatively modern , older software does n\'t know how to deal with it . When you make a video , you choose what container you want based on your needs , but it has absolutely zero effect on the image quality , and it is very easy to change later . For example , today I made a file where the video format was H.264 , the audio format was MP3 , the subtitle format was SRT , and the container format was MKV . That \'s an MKV file , but the * video * is n\'t MKV , it \'s H.264 . MKV \'s just the container I put all the stuff in .', 'So you have the data corresponding to some movie , and you want your computer to play it . How does the computer make this happen ? It would be simplest if the data that your computer uses to store the movie * were * the instructions to your screen and speakers to make it work . Problem is , this would be incredibly inefficient ; it would be like having a book say READ THE FOLLOWING before every single word in the book . So instead , we just store the data , and have some program whose job it is to convert the data into display instructions . That program is called a codec .', ""Codec stands for compressor - decompressor . When you encode the video , it 's compressed so you can fit more movie into the same space . Audio and video are handled separately because you can compress them in different ways . You need the same codec to decompress the movie back into usable audio and video . Files like AVI are actually containers that hold the audio and video streams often as separate files . This is why audio and video can become desynchronized .""]",0

"How do banks create money ? How does credit lead to money creation , what consequences does this have on the economy and when did this practice start ? Explain like I'm five. ","[""Banks create money by making loans. When a bank makes a loan, it creates a new deposit in the borrower's account. This deposit can be used to make payments or to withdraw cash, just like any other deposit. The deposit is created out of thin air, and it represents a new liability for the bank.\\n\\nThe borrower can use the money from the loan to buy goods and services, and this can lead to an increase in economic activity. However, it's important to note that the loan has to be repaid with interest, so the borrower has to pay back more money than they received.\\n\\nThis practice of creating money through lending has been around for centuries. It allows banks to help fund economic growth and provide a way for people and businesses to borrow money. However, it can also lead to problems if banks make too many risky loans and people or businesses struggle to repay them. This can cause a financial crisis, like the one that occurred in 2008.\\n\\nOverall, the practice of banks creating money through lending can have both positive and negative effects on the economy. It's important for banks and regulators to carefully monitor lending to ensure that it is done in a responsible way.""]",1
"How do banks generate profit , adjust for inflation , and can reimburse their customers fully without collapsing ? I did n't pay enough attention in economics . EDIT : Thanks for the replies guys , they were all very helpful . Explain like I'm five.","['Banks make money by borrowing money from some customers, such as individuals or businesses, and lending it to other customers at a higher rate of interest. The difference between the rate at which the bank borrows money and the rate at which it lends money is called the ""spread,"" and it is the main source of the bank\'s profit.\r\n\r\nTo adjust for inflation, banks can increase the interest rates they charge on loans. Inflation is when the general price level of goods and services increases over time, which means that the same amount of money is worth less in the future. By charging higher interest rates, banks can compensate for the fact that the money they lend will be worth less in the future due to inflation.\r\n\r\nBanks can also compensate for inflation by investing in assets that are expected to increase in value over time, such as stocks or real estate.\r\n\r\nTo reimburse their customers fully without collapsing, banks need to make sure that they have enough money on hand to cover all of the money that their customers want to withdraw. They do this by setting aside a certain amount of money as reserves, which they can use to pay customers if necessary. In addition, banks are regulated by government agencies, which require them to maintain a certain level of financial stability and to hold a certain amount of capital as a buffer against losses.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps to explain how banks make money, adjust for inflation, and remain financially stable.

How do banks lose money on foreclosures?,"[""When a borrower defaults on their mortgage, the lender may initiate a foreclosure process to try to recoup their losses. During the foreclosure process, the lender takes possession of the property and tries to sell it in order to pay off the outstanding mortgage debt. If the lender is able to sell the property for an amount that is higher than the outstanding mortgage debt, they will make a profit.However, if the lender is unable to sell the property for an amount that is higher than the outstanding mortgage debt, they will lose money on the foreclosure. This can happen if the property market is depressed, or if the property itself has declined in value due to neglect or damage. In this case, the lender will have to write off the loss as a bad debt.It's also important to note that the foreclosure process can be costly for the lender, as they may have to pay for repairs, maintenance, and legal fees. These costs can further reduce the amount of money the lender is able to recover from the sale of the property.""]",1
How do banks lose money on foreclosures?,"['Someone has to hand out cash to the seller. Even if no physical money changes hands (and I\'ve bought a house; I can tell you a LOT of money changes hands at closing in at least the form of a personal check), and regardless of exactly how the bank accounts for the actual disbursement of the loan, the net result is that the buyer has cash that they give the seller, and are now in debt to the bank for least that amount (but, they now have a house). Now, the bank probably didn\'t have that money just sitting in its vault. Money sitting in a vault is money that is not making more money for the bank; therefore most banks keep only fractionally more than the percentage of deposit balances that they are required to keep by the Feds. There are also restrictions on what depositors\' money can be spent on, and loans are not one of them; the model of taking in money in savings accounts and then loaning it out is what caused the savings and loan collapse in the 80s. So, to get the money, it turns to investors; the bank sells bonds, putting itself in debt to bond holders, then takes that money and loans it out at a higher rate, covering the interest on the bond and making itself a tidy profit for its own shareholders. Banks lose money on defaults in two ways. First, they lose all future interest payments that would have been made on the loan. Technically, this isn\'t ""revenue"" until the interest is calculated for each month and ""accrues"" on the loan; therefore, it doesn\'t show on the balance sheet one way or the other. However, the holders of those bonds will expect a return, and the banks no longer have the mortgage payment to cover the coupon payments that they themselves have to pay bondholders, creating cash flow problems. The second, and far more real and damaging, way that banks lose money on a foreclosure is the loss of collateral value. A bank virtually never offers an unsecured ""signature loan"" for a house (certainly not at the advertised 3-4% interest rates). They want something to back up the loan, so if you disappear off the face of the earth they have a clear claim to something that can help them recover their money. Usually, that\'s the house itself; if you default, they get the house from you and sell it to recover their money. Now, a major cause of foreclosure is economic downturn, like the one we had in 2009 and are still recovering from. When the economy goes in the crapper, a lot of things we generally consider ""stores of value"" lose that value, because the value of the whatzit (any whatzit, really) is based on what someone else would pay to have it. When fewer people are looking to buy that whatzit, demand drops, bringing prices with it. Homes and real estate are one of the real big-ticket items subject to this loss of value; when the average Joe doesn\'t know whether he\'ll have a job tomorrow, he doesn\'t go house-hunting. This average Joe may even be looking to sell an extra parcel of land or an income property for cash, increasing supply, further decreasing prices. Economic downturn can often increase crime and decrease local government spending on upkeep of public lands (as well as homeowners\' upkeep of their own property). By the ""broken window"" effect, this makes the neighborhood even less desirable in a vicious cycle. What made this current recession a double-whammy for mortgage lenders is that it was caused, in large part, by a housing bubble; cheap money for houses made housing prices balloon rapidly, and then when the money became more expensive (such as in sub-prime ARMs), a lot of those loans, which should never have been signed off on by either side, went belly-up. Between the loss of home value (a lot of which will likely turn out to be permanent; that\'s the problem with a bubble, things never recover to their peak) and the adjustment of interest rates on mortgages to terms that will actually pay off the loan, many homeowners found themselves so far underwater (and sinking fast) that the best financial move for them was to walk away from the whole thing and try again in seven years. Now the bank\'s in a quandary. They have this loan they\'ll never see repaid in cash, and they have this home that\'s worth maybe 75% of the mortgage\'s outstanding balance (if they\'re lucky; some homes in extremely ""distressed"" areas like Detroit are currently trading for 30-40% of what they sold for just before the bubble burst). Multiply that by, say, 100,000 distressed homes with similar declines in value, and you\'re talking about tens of billions of dollars in losses. On top of that, the guarantor (basically the bank\'s insurance company against these types of losses) is now in financial trouble themselves, because they took on so many contracts for debt that turned out to be bad (AIG, Fannie/Freddie); they may very well declare bankruptcy and leave the bank holding the bag. Even if the guarantor remains solvent (as they did thanks to generous taxpayer bailouts), the bank\'s swap contract with the guarantor usually requires them to sell the house, thus realizing the loss between what they paid and what they finally got back, before the guarantor will pay out. But nobody\'s buying houses anymore, because prices are on their way down; the only people who\'d buy a house now versus a year from now (or two or three years) are the people who have no choice, and if you have no choice you\'re probably in a financial situation that would mean you\'d never be approved for the loan anyway. In order to get rid of them, the bank has to sell them at auction for pennies on the dollar. That further increases the supply of cheap homes and further drives down prices, making even the nicer homes the bank\'s willing to keep on the books worth less (there\'s a reason these distresed homes were called ""toxic assets""; they\'re poisonous to the banks whether they keep or sell them). Meanwhile, all this price depression is now affecting the people who did everything right; even people who bought their homes years before the bubble even formed are watching years of equity-building go down the crapper. That\'s to say nothing of the people with prime credit who bought at just the wrong time, when the bubble was at its peak. Even without an adjusting ARM to contend with, these guys are still facing the fact that they paid top dollar for a house that likely will not be worth its purchase price again in their lifetime. Even with a fixed mortgage rate, they\'ll be underwater, effectively losing their entire payment to the bank as if it were rent, for much longer than it would take to have this entire mess completely behind them if they just walked away from the whole thing, moved back into an apartment and waited it out. So, these guys decide on a ""strategic default""; give the bank the house (which doesn\'t cover the outstanding balance of course) and if they sue, file bankruptcy. That really makes the banks nervous; if people who did everything right are considering the hell of foreclosure and bankruptcy to be preferable to their current state of affairs, the bank\'s main threat keeping people in their homes is hollow. That makes them very reluctant to sign new mortgages, because the risk of default is now much less certain. Now people who do want houses in this market can\'t buy them, further reducing demand, further decreasing prices... You get the idea. That\'s the housing collapse in a nutshell, and what banks and our free market have been working through for the past five years, with only the glimmer of a turnaround picking up home sales.']",0

Batteries are like tiny power plants that can be used to store electricity for later use.

Another theory is that the matter gets sucked into a different universe or dimension.\n\nEither way, it\'s important to note that black holes aren\'t just vacuum cleaners sucking up everything in their path. They are extremely complex and mysterious objects that are still being studied and understood by scientists.']",1
How do black holes work ? Mainly - Where does what ever it sucks up go ? Explain like I'm five.,"[""You need to know two things to understand this . You know how if you put heavy things on top of something , it crushes it ? Black holes kind of work like that . Imagine if you started stacking loaves of bread up and up and up , hundreds and hundreds of loaves . The ones on the bottom would get really really crushed , right ? However , the same amount of bread is there , it 's just fitting into a smaller space . There 's also this thing called gravity . It 's basically a force that makes stuff pull other stuff toward it . The bigger something is , the stronger it pulls . Earth has gravity , and it 's what keeps us from floating off into space . It 's always pulling you in . Really big stuff pulls everything else into the centre of it . It even pulls on itself ! The outside is always being pulled into the inside . So imagine millions of loaves of bread in a big ball in space , bigger than Earth . They 'd all be crushing the ones in the middle , and then the gravity of the ball would pull more loaves of bread in . As they pulled more in , the ball would get bigger and gravity would pull harder , and the ones in the middle would get crushed more and more . Eventually , the ball would get so big and gravity would pull on all the loaves of bread so hard that it would crush them all at once into the very centre . They 'd all be crushed into a really really tiny space , smaller than a single loaf of bread . The gravity would be so strong when this happens that it even pulls in light ! This is how a black hole works ."", ""> Mainly - Where does what ever it sucks up go ? The easy answer is : Inside . It works kind of like this : Matter is pulled together by gravity in the heart of a star . Stars are themselves inherently unstable things . Imagine trying to keep a layer of water up in the air by continually blowing up nuclear bombs underneath , rather than setting up a platform . What you get eventually is an equilibrium where the outer layer rests : A point at which the force of gravity is negated by the force of the explosions . This is a star , with a defined size . Eventually the fuel runs out . You have no bombs left . The last explosions are pretty huge and blow a huge amount of the star 's mass into space , but sometimes the star is just too big . After the big explosion ( supernova ) , the explosive forces are spent and can no longer hold back the layers above . Gravity takes hold and starts pulling the mass further inwards . There are various levels of equilibrium a star can end up at , whether a dwarf or neutron star , or if enough mass is present , a black hole . A black hole is just like any other star . A concentration of mass in a fixed amount of space . The difference is that a black hole 's mass is condensed so much that it 's gravity can trap light in a local area around it , the event horizon . At this point we note something important : The gravitational force created by a mass is dependent on how dense that mass is . You do n't need a star to create a black hole , you can create a black hole from a few atoms if you can compress them enough . These micro black holes , however are unstable and dissipate very quickly . Anyway , the mass is compressed by its gravity to a point where gravity 's effect on light causes it to fold back on itself in an orbit . If you fall past the event horizon of a black hole , you have n't reached the singularity . You may even find the inside of a black hole quite bright . It is possible that light may be circling the singularity eternally without ever falling in . A singularity , after all , is quite small compared to the event horizon . Basically , imagine a black hole as you would any star , with orbiting items . The only difference being that some of those items exist in an orbit that can never direct itself out of the gravity well . This area is the event horizon . As for what happens when mass reaches the singularity ... no one really knows . The Star Trek universe , maybe ? -------- Also ( as I saw this mentioned below ) relativity : Time slows down to an outside observer watching you approach a black hole . There are many better explanations for this but I use this as a rule of thumb : Imagine a graph with an X plane and a Y plane . X includes the 3 dimensions of space as we know them . Y is time . The higher your value of X out of 100 , the lower of Y and vice versa . The more potential energy you expend moving through space out of the 100 , the less you expend moving through time . If you were to move at the speed of light , time would stop completely from your perspective as there would be 0 on the Y axis . You can never move at the speed of light as you exert some of this potential as mass rather than speed . Mass being a dense form of energy . You can also never move faster than light as you would require greater than the 100 to do so . This would also technically make you move back in time ( when you take reference frames into account , but that 's another lecture . )"", ""I keep a few old /r / askscience threads saved for just such an occasion : [ I would like to understand black holes . ] ( URL_1 ) [ What would happen if the event horizons of two black holes touched ? ] ( URL_2 ) And , perhaps most relevant to your specific question : [ What 's in a black hole ? ] ( URL_0 )""]",0

Why are n't the hairs on your arms , legs , armpits , or * ahem * pubic areas the same way ? Explain like I'm five.","['Hairs on different parts of your body grow to different lengths because they are in different stages of the hair growth cycle. The hair growth cycle is made up of three stages: the anagen phase, the catagen phase, and the telogen phase.\n\nThe anagen phase is the active growth phase, during which the hair follicle (the structure that grows the hair) is actively producing new cells that push the hair shaft (the part of the hair that you can see) upward. The anagen phase lasts for different lengths of time depending on the location of the hair. For example, the anagen phase for hair on your head can last for several years, while the anagen phase for hair on your arms and legs lasts for only a few months.\n\nThe catagen phase is a transitional phase in which the hair stops growing and the hair follicle begins to shrink. This phase lasts for about two to three weeks.\n\nThe telogen phase is the resting phase, during which the hair follicle is not actively growing new cells. At the end of the telogen phase, the hair falls out and a new hair begins to grow in its place. This phase lasts for about three months.\n\nSo, to answer your question, the hairs on your arms, legs, armpits, and pubic areas stop growing because they enter the resting phase (the telogen phase) of the hair growth cycle.

Please explain like I'm five.","['Bookies make money by taking bets from people on the outcome of sporting events and other events. They set odds on each event, and the odds reflect the probability of each outcome occurring. The bookie will take bets from people on each outcome, and they will pay out to the people who bet on the correct outcome. For example, let\'s say there is a football game and the bookie sets the odds at 50/50 for each team to win. This means that the bookie thinks both teams have an equal chance of winning. If 100 people bet on the game, and 50 people bet on one team and 50 people bet on the other team, the bookie will make a profit no matter which team wins. This is because the bookie will keep the money from the losing bets, and pay out the winnings to the people who bet on the winning team. So, the bookie makes money by taking a small percentage of the bets placed on each event as their profit. This is called the ""vigorish,"" or ""vig"" for short. As long as the bookie sets the odds correctly and takes bets on both sides of the event, they will make a profit.']",1
How do boomerangs work ? Why do boomerangs come back ? Is there a certain way of throwing them ?

The shape of the boomerang and the way it is spinning causes it to curve back towards you, like a circular path.

Physical training: Boxers work on building strength and endurance in their muscles through weight training, cardio exercises, and sparring (practicing fighting with another boxer). This helps them physically handle the impact of punches and stay on their feet longer during a fight. \n2. Mental training: Boxers also work on their mental toughness by training themselves to stay focused and calm under pressure. They practice techniques like visualization and deep breathing to stay composed and clear-headed, even when they're in the middle of a tough fight. \n3. Techniques to avoid getting hit: Boxers also work on techniques to avoid getting hit, such as dodging, weaving, and footwork. By learning how to move their body effectively and stay out of their opponent's range, they can reduce their chances of getting hit and being knocked out. \n4. Knowing how to take a punch: Finally, boxers learn how to take a punch and minimize the damage it causes. They practice techniques like rolling with the punch and tucking their chin to help absorb the impact and reduce the chances of being knocked out. \nOverall, being a successful boxer requires a combination of physical, mental, and technical skills. By working on all of these areas, boxers can improve their chances of not getting knocked out and having a successful fight.""]",1

This guess doesn\'t have to be very accurate, it just needs to be close.\n\nNext, you use the following formula to improve your guess:\n\nguess = (guess + (X / guess)) / 2\n\nThis formula takes your current guess, and then adds X divided by the guess, and then divides that number by 2. This gives you a new, improved guess for the square root.\n\nYou can then repeat this process as many times as you want, using your new guess as the input each time. Each time you repeat the process, your guess will become more and more accurate. Eventually, your guess will be accurate enough, and you can stop the process.\n\nThat\'s the basic idea behind the Newton-Raphson method for finding square roots.

But basically you burn fuel , which expands and moves the piston .', ""A normal car engine is what 's known as a 4 - stroke engine , meaning that there are 4 stages in each cycle . 1 . Intake 2 . Compression 3 . Power 4 . Exhaust An engine is powered by repeated explosions inside a cylinder . Intake ( 1 ) is the first step in this cycle and it occurs when fuel is injected into the cylinder , the gas - air mixture is then compressed ( 2 ) before being ignited by a spark plug , the ignition of the fuel pushes a piston ( 3 ) which is used to spin a crankshaft that goes through a clutch / torque converter and into the transmission of your car , eventually powering your wheels . The ignited air - fuel mixture is then released from the cylinder as exhaust ( 4 ) . Edit : this guy does a great job explaining the concept as well as many other car - related topics : URL_0"", 'You have a crankshaft , upon which sits pistons on rods . This is the Reciprocating Assembly and sits inside the engine block . From here you have two designs , Overhead Cam ( OHC ) and Overhead Valve ( OHV ) . The Japanese have pretty much always used OHC , Domestics were a bit late to the party and still use some OHV engines to this day . In an OHV engine , the engine block will also have a bore for the camshaft . A timing chain connects a gear on the crankshaft to a gear on the camshaft . The camshaft will have offset lobes , one for each valve on the engine . Typically an OHV engine will have two valves per cylinder . One for Intake , and one for exhaust . On top of these lobes on the camshaft ride lifters , generally hydraulic . On top of these ride pushrods . When a head is fitted to the engine block , it will have holes in it that the pushrods go through . Bolted to the head will be rocker arms . These open valves when they are pushed up on one side by the pushrod , which in turn has been pushed up by the lifter riding on the camshaft , spun by the timing chain connected to the crankshaft . Due to gearing between the two , the camshaft always spins at half the speed of the crankshaft . We refer to engines of this design as 4 stroke engines . On the first stroke , the camshaft opens up the intake valve for a cylinder by pushing up on its pushrod . At the same time , the piston for that cylinder is traveling downwards on the crankshaft . This creates a vacuum that sucks in the fuel mixture . When the piston has reached the bottom of its travel , it starts its way back up as the intake valve closes . This is called the compression stroke . When the piston reaches the top , it has compressed the fuel mixture into the small chamber inside the cylinder head . At this point , the spark plug fires . This is controlled either by your engine computer or by a distributor that is also driven off of the crankshaft . When the compressed mixture ignites , it forces the piston back down , this is the 3rd cycle . As the piston reaches the bottom of its stroke for the second time , the camshaft is also opening the exhaust valve via its pushrod . As the piston travels back up ( because it is on the reciprocating assembly and another piston has been pushed down , spinning the assembly ) , the exhaust valve opens . The exhaust gasses are then pushed out of the cylinder , and the process begins again . An OHC engine works essentially the same , except that rather than use pushrods , each head will house its own camshaft that rides on top of the valves , and opens each with a rocker arm . OHC engines generally use a timing belt instead of a timing chain , but there are exceptions . If I can clarify anything , let me know .']",0
How do car engines work ? I have small background in thermodynamics so i think i can understand some terms . Please explain like I'm five.,"['Sure! A car engine is a machine that converts energy into motion. It does this by burning fuel (like gasoline) and using the energy from the resulting explosion to turn a crankshaft. Inside the engine, there is a cylinder with a piston inside it. The explosion pushes the piston down, causing the crankshaft to rotate. This rotation turns the wheels of the car, making it move. The process of burning fuel and turning the crankshaft is called the ""combustion cycle."" It starts when a spark plug sends a spark of electricity into the cylinder, which ignites the fuel and causes it to burn. As the fuel burns, it creates hot gases that push against the piston. The piston pushes back against the crankshaft, causing it to turn. When the crankshaft has turned a full 360 degrees, the combustion cycle is complete and it starts all over again. That\'s a very simplified explanation, but I hope it helps! Let me know if you have any questions.']",1

Well . Valve float was mentioned earlier and they did a very good job explaining it . In a traditional engine a shaft with rollers pushes down on the valve to open it allowing air in or exhaust out . Springs sit on these valves and ensure they close all the way back in their "" seat "" before the piston head comes all the way to top dead center(TDC ) if then engine goes too fast the valve and piston can touch . This is very bad and will destroy your engine in seconds . Remember the main factor here is speed . Closing and opening valves takes time . And the faster the engine spins the smaller that window gets . So you \'ve solved the valve float issue . What \'s the next limiting factor ? Turns out it \'s pump gas . People do n\'t often think of this but it \'s controlled explosions that produce the power in an internal combustion engine . And an explosion takes time . Granted we are talking fractions of seconds at this point but eventually there is a point were the gas ca n\'t be shot into the cylinder , atomized , and burned to actually do any good in the engine . The larger the cylinder the more this effects it . ( Fun fact about pump gas it \'s probably one of the least efficient fuels to burn in an engine because it has a tendency to form droplets rather than atomize . This causes weird burn patters or unspent fuel . ) And finally you have overheating . If you \'re running at high RPMs you \'re generating more heat . Eventually you reach a point where the cylinder is too hot and the gas auto - ignites . This is extremely bad for an engine because the point of ignition can happen inside the boundary layer which will cause holes to be melted or blown out of your cylinder or head . There is a few other things that can limit it but not important for Eli5 . There is a whole bunch of math involved calculating mechanical creep , tolerances for creep , expected lifetime , etc to set that "" red line "" in a production car .

"How do cars measure their own speed I mean , is there sensors or something that can do measure speed ? Help . Explain like I'm five. ","[""Yes, cars have sensors that can measure their own speed. These sensors are called speedometers. Speedometers use a device called a speedometer cable, which is connected to the car's transmission. As the car moves, the transmission causes the speedometer cable to rotate. The speedometer cable is connected to the speedometer, which is a gauge inside the car that measures the speed of the car. The speedometer has a needle that moves around a dial to show the car's speed. Some cars also have sensors called GPS sensors, which can use satellite signals to measure the speed of the car.""]",1

The cable spins a magnet around at the same speed inside the speed cup . The magnet rotates continually in the same direction ( in this case , counter - clockwise ) . The spinning magnet creates eddy currents in the speed cup . The eddy currents make the speed cup rotate counter - clockwise as well in an attempt to catch up with the magnet . Remember that the magnet and the speed cup are not joined together in any way — there 's air in between them . The hair spring tightens , restraining the speed cup so it can turn only a little way .

The response from u / alek_hiddel is great and very accurate ( except the speed gear is usually in the transmission rather that on the drive shaft ) but it 's for older speedometers .

The sensor senses a change in the field ( a very slight magnetic field , but not a magnet ) as the bumps / gaps pass by . That signal is conveyed to the computer which then calculates the speed of that wheel and sends a signal to the speedometer , which then turns a tiny motor to the right location on the dial ( or just displays it digitally ) . The advantage of doing it this way is that many modern cars have a tone ring on each wheel so the computer knows which tires are rotating faster than the others ( indicating a loss of traction ) and can either apply the ABS ( if the wheel has stopped turning ) or apply traction control ( if it 's spinning faster ) .""]",0

How do casinos know you are card counting / how do they catch you ? It seems like there is no way for them to know for sure but i have heard of many people getting banned for it . Explain like I'm five. ,"[""Card counting is a technique used by some blackjack players to try and determine whether the next hand is likely to be favorable to the player or to the dealer. It is based on the idea that, in a deck of cards, there are more face cards (jacks, queens, and kings) than small cards (2 through 6). Since face cards are worth 10 points and small cards are worth less, a player who knows that there are more small cards left in the deck may be more likely to win the hand.\\n\\nNow, casinos don't like players to use card counting because it gives the player an advantage over the house. So, they have a few ways to try and catch people who are doing it. One way is to watch how the player bets. If the player suddenly starts betting a lot of money when the deck is favorable, that might be a sign that the player is counting cards. Casinos might also use surveillance cameras to watch players and see if they are doing anything unusual, like keeping track of the cards that have been played. Finally, some casinos will ban players who are caught counting cards, or they might ask them to leave and not come back.\\n\\nI hope that helps! Do you have any more questions about this?""]",1

"How do chinese people Alphabetize ? EDIT : Oh shit , I need to get bored in class more often . Please explain like I'm five.","['Just like everyone else ; the English alphabet does n\'t change if you \'re Chinese ... On a more serious note , there are two ways : 1 . You group in radicals ( i.e. the radical 女 means "" woman "" and makes all characters that contain it have a feminine quality : - 妈 = Mother - 姐 = older sister - 好 = good Within radicals , you group by number of strokes needed to write that radical : - 女 takes 3 strokes to write - 木 takes 4 strokes to write Therefore , words that contain 女 as a radical come before those that contain 木 in a dictionary . For a complete list of radicals in the order they come in a dictionary : URL_3 2 . The other way to alphabetize is quite modern since it \'s a western adaptation . Every character in mandarin Chinese can be pronounced using the western alphabet plus an accent , so in dictionaries that use this classification , they \'ll convert 女 to "" nǚ "" , 妈 to "" mā "" , 姐 to "" jiě "" . It would work just like an English dictionary , j coming before m , 姐 would come before 妈 . Now to classify accents , they follow this simple order : - Flat accent ( horizontal line above the letter you want accented ) comes first : - ( e.g. ā ) - Ascending accent comes second : / ( e.g. é ) - Valley accent comes third : v ( e.g. ě ) - Descending accent comes fourth and last : \\ ( e.g. à ) There are of course special cases like ¨ , but that \'s more advanced , and not incredibly relevant to the main question .

So let 's get started shall we ? I speak Mandarin as my second language , and am more familiar with the simplified version . There are two types of Mandarin : simplified and traditional . Trust me , the traditional version is much more convoluted than the simplified one . Firstly , in Mandarin , there is probably no equivalent of alphabetization , at least not in the conventional way . This is n't really surprising , since the characters descended from pictograms - images that convey a message . Thus , you can see that Mandarin characters more closely resemble pictures , rather than the normal alphabets that we see in English . Now then , how do we depict Mandarin characters ? Most simple characters consist of a left side and a right side . In some cases , both sides tell a story . For example , the character 话 is made up of 言(this is the traditional version of the left side ) and 舌 . The left tells us that this word is related to speech , since 言 means speech . The right is the character for the tongue . Put them together , and you get the character for the English equivalent of word . Speech from the tongue = word . Then again , it is n't always so simple . For some characters , only one side tells a story . I 'll take the example raised by /u / pudmedcentury . 姐 is made up of 女 and 且 . 女 tell us that this character is referencing to something feminine . However , as far as I know , 且 does not give any meaning to 姐 . For the record , 姐 means older sister , which addresses the feminine portion . Some characters operate in a different way - up and down . The character 烫 which means hot or scalded , is made up of 汤(soup ) and 火(fire ) . In the past , people probably got scalded by hot soup most frequently , leading to this character . Fire + soup = hot ( or if you are unlucky , scalded ) . There are many more orientations to Mandarin characters , including single words ( e.g. 人 which means person ) , top - left - right ( e.g. 森 which means forest ) , left - top - bottom ( e.g. 祸 which means disaster ) . As usual , some parts have meaning , some parts do n't ( as far as I know ) . There are just too many to list , and as such , I do n't think that Mandarin characters can be alphabetized in an English sort of way . How then do Mandarin dictionaries work ? Every character has a pronunciation , which is translated to English alphabets . So 森 is sen , 人 is ren , 烫 is tang . Basically , all the characters are arranged in alphabetical order , which makes the foundation of the dictionary . However , every translation normally has 4 tones . In Mandarin we call them 声(shēng ) , or sound . In speech , the 4 tones of the same translation sound different , with each tone having many characters . So 汤(tāng - first tone ) , 堂(táng - second tone ) , 躺(tǎng - third tone ) , 烫(tàng - fourth tone ) all sound different and have different meanings , 堂 , 糖 , 塘 , 膛 ( táng ) all sound the same , but have different meanings . Characters in dictionaries are first arranged by alphabets , and within same translations , arranged by tones . This is probably the closest that we have to alphabetization in Mandarin . There are many more aspects to Mandarin , like the fifth tone ( ü ) and the sequence to writing Mandarin characters . This is an incredibly complex language to learn with an incredibly large amount of vocabulary . Feel free to ask any questions or correct any mistakes that I made , or even to ask for the meaning of any characters that I used .""]",0
"How do chinese people Alphabetize ? EDIT : Oh shit , I need to get bored in class more often . Please explain like I'm five.","['In China, the official writing system is Chinese characters, which are not based on an alphabet. Chinese characters represent the pronunciation of a word and its meaning, but they do not represent individual sounds like the letters of an alphabet do. \nInstead of using an alphabet, Chinese people use a system called pinyin to alphabetize words. Pinyin is a system that represents the sounds of Chinese characters using the letters of the Latin alphabet. For example, the Chinese character for ""apple"" is 苹果 (píng guǒ) in pinyin. \nTo alphabetize words in Chinese using pinyin, you would simply arrange the words in order based on the pinyin spelling. For example, ""apple"" would come before ""banana"" because ""a"" comes before ""b"" in the alphabet. \nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.']",1

The humans started by searching for repeating patterns , for indications that a ciphertext was made up of words of certain lengths , for indications that there were certain words , etc .

Encrypted messages are difficult for anyone to understand without knowing the code, so code breaking machines are used to try to figure out the code and decrypt the message.

The code breaking machines at Bletchley Park used a combination of computers and human analysts to try to figure out the code and decrypt the messages. One way that the code breaking machines at Bletchley Park tried to decode messages was by searching for common words or patterns in the encrypted messages. For example, if a message contained a lot of letters that were repeated, the code breaking machines might try using a code that replaced repeated letters with the same letter. This would allow the code breakers to see if the decrypted message made any sense, and if it did, they would know that they had probably broken the code. Overall, code breaking machines try different codes and compare the decrypted messages to see if they make sense. If the decrypted message makes sense and appears to be a meaningful message, then the code breaking machine knows that it has probably broken the code.']",1
"How do college campuses have the same WiFi network across entire campuses ? How do all the routers connect to the same network ? Also in some places on campus my internet works way better than others , so does each router have its own bandwidth ? Explain like I'm five.","[""It 's called a [ wifi mesh ] ( URL_0 ) . There are multiple ways to set up a wifi mesh . From having one wifi access point connect over wifi to a neighbor , to having all access points connect to a central switch over Ethernet . As for why some on - campus locations appear ( or are ) to be faster or slower than others , that 's something you 'd have to ask your campus network staff ."", ""Large - scale WiFi deployments tend to work quite differently to simple home or small business networks . There are so many Access Points ( APs ) that they wo n't fit on a single Ethernet network , they interfere with each other , and users are constantly being passed from one AP to another , sometimes on different networks , as they move around . Also , you ca n't just have a single password and tell everyone , so you need to implement enterprise - scale authentication allowing users to connect using their username and password . Without going into too many details , enterprise WiFi typically has a central controller box ( or boxes for redundancy ) . The APs are really dumb radios that send and receive all their packets to and from the central controller to be dealt with . The WiFi packets are sent via a TCP / IP protocol so the APs can all be on different Ethernet segments themselves , even though the WiFi environment they present to the users looks like a single network . The central server device is configured to have access to the corporate authentication service ( e.g. , via Radius ) so it can use the same username / password authentication as other IT services on campus . The problem with bandwidth tends to be on the WiFi side rather than the Ethernet network side . Campuses tend to have hundreds of WiFi users , some with multiple devices . In a small space all these devices will be talking with just a few APs with only a small number of non - overlapping WiFi channels available . At 2.4GHz , for example , there are 11 channels ( varies by country ) but you have to space by 5 channels to avoid overlap , so using only channels 1 , 6 , and 11 is common . There are more channels ( 8 ? ) at 5GHz but still not that many . In common areas they will pack in many APs and turn down their WiFi power to try to limit how much they interfere with each other , but this is really a work - around . Also , devices using old WiFi standards tend to slow down the network for everyone . So there 's no point stealing enterprise APs ; they 're totally useless devices without tons of expensive hardware to make them work , hardware that requires expertise to configure and run ."", ""The network is deployed out in segments . Think of it like this - each floor of each building gets its own network , and then the buildings have routers that connect all of those networks together , and then those routers connect to the campus ' data center where there are bigger routers that handle connecting not only the buildings to each other but the entire campus to the Internet at large . As far as the WiFi goes - when you 're deploying a campus - wide network , there will be centralized management of the access points in order to handle things like channel assignments and client management . Every access point is given the same name and to a user looks like seamless coverage , but there will be dozens if not hundreds or thousands of access points blanketing the campus with the same SSID . However , those access points are all going to be working on different channels so as to not overlap signals with each other ( either in the general 1 - 6 - 11 configuration to eliminate channel overlap or in a 1 - 4 - 8 - 11 configuration to simply minimize it ) . As well , the central management of the access points will work to try and prevent a single access point from getting overloaded . Throw 200 people into a lecture hall with one access point and the amount of effective bandwidth for users is going to be quite minimal . But if you have ten access points in and around the lecture hall , the server can force clients to disconnect from one access point and reconnect to another access point with a decent signal strength so that you have people on the edges of the hall connecting to access points in other rooms so that each access point gets 20 users competing for the bandwidth instead of 200 . Access points can be connected in two ways - wired or mesh . If an access point is wired , as most access points in a campus - level network should be , it will have its own dedicated bandwidth that it can serve of either 100 Mbps or 1 Gbps . If the access point is connected in a mesh configuration , bandwidth management becomes more complex because the access point needs to use its radios for both serving clients and getting their traffic upstream . Why does it work better in some places rather than others ? There are a lot of reasons for that . It could be that other users are causing bandwidth congestion - a couple of people connected to the same access point are watching Netflix , so you go to download a file and find that the pool of bandwidth you 're sharing is mostly going to serve them instead of you because their usage is more constant than yours . It could be that there are too many users connected to the access point - wireless bandwidth is a shared pool among the users , so the more users there are the more contention there is to try and use the same bandwidth and the more overhead increases trying to separate everyone 's traffic . And it could be that you 're getting a bad signal - your radio might indicate that you 're getting a good signal power , but the wall between you and the access point might be scattering that signal to hell and back in a way that causes both your device and the access point to have to constantly resend data to ensure it 's being received properly .""]",0

What if Tom actually did kill Jerry , would it be good riddance ? Explain like I'm five. Tom and Jerry is a cartoon that is meant to be entertaining, not realistic. In the show, Tom and Jerry are always fighting, but no one really gets hurt. It's like a game or a competition. Even though Tom is always trying to catch Jerry, it's not meant to be taken seriously. It's just a way for the characters to have fun and for the audience to laugh. If Tom actually did kill Jerry, it would be very sad and it wouldn't be funny at all. It's important to remember that it's just a cartoon and not to try to do the things that the characters do in real life.""]",1
"How do companies go public ? And more specifically , what drives that decision and who pursues the IPO for that company ? Please explain like I'm five.","[""Sure! A company can go public by selling shares of its stock to the general public. This is called an initial public offering, or IPO. There are a few reasons why a company might decide to go public. One reason is to raise money. When a company sells shares of its stock, it gets money that it can use to grow and expand the business. Going public can also be a way for the company's owners to get some of their money back if they want to sell some of their ownership in the company.There are a few people who help a company go public. Investment bankers are one group of people who work on an IPO. They help the company decide how many shares to sell and how much to sell them for. Lawyers and accountants are also involved in the process. They help make sure that the company is following all of the rules and regulations for going public.""]",1

Explain like I'm five.","[""There are several ways that companies can measure the value they are getting from their advertising dollars. Here are a few examples: Sales: One way to measure the value of advertising is to track how much sales increase after a new ad campaign is launched. This can help a company see if the ads are effectively driving people to make purchases. Website traffic: Companies can also track how many people are visiting their website after seeing an ad. This can help them understand if their ads are effective at driving people to their website and potentially making a purchase. Brand awareness: Some companies may not be trying to drive immediate sales with their ads, but rather focus on increasing brand awareness. In this case, they might measure the value of their advertising by tracking how many people recognize their brand or are familiar with it. Customer loyalty: Companies can also measure the value of their advertising by tracking how loyal their customers are. If a company's ads are successful at building a strong connection with customers, they may be more likely to continue purchasing from that company in the future. Overall, there are many different ways that companies can measure the value of their advertising, and the best approach will depend on the specific goals and objectives of the company.""]",1

Please explain all of the aspects of this -- it seems insane to me . Explain like I'm five.,"[""It is true that some companies, like GE, are able to pay relatively low effective tax rates. There are a few reasons for this.\r\n\r\nFirst, different companies have different types of income and are subject to different tax rates. For example, some types of income may be taxed at a lower rate than others. Additionally, some companies may be eligible for tax credits or deductions, which can reduce their overall tax bill.\r\n\r\nSecond, some companies may be able to take advantage of tax loopholes or use tax planning strategies to reduce their taxes. For example, a company may set up operations in a country with lower tax rates, or it may structure its business in a way that allows it to take advantage of tax breaks.\r\n\r\nFinally, it's important to note that the effective tax rate is not the same as the statutory tax rate. The effective tax rate is the actual amount of taxes a company pays as a percentage of its profits, while the statutory tax rate is the rate set by law that a company is supposed to pay. The effective tax rate can be lower than the statutory rate due to the various credits, deductions, and tax planning strategies that a company may use.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps to explain the situation!

Some seedless fruits, like seedless grapes and seedless watermelons, are produced using this method. 2. Grafting: In this method, the stem of a plant that is capable of producing seedless fruit is grafted onto the root system of another plant. This allows the plant to produce fruit without seeds, because the seed-forming tissues are not present in the grafted part of the plant.

Because writing AI for enemies that only know how to attack you on sight or zombies ( that are naturally very dumb ) is A LOT easier and more convincing than writing AI 's that now have to respond to your actions which are not pre - determined and not repeat the same 4 lines over and over again .

"How do computer game AIs work ? I am mostly thinking of ' open ' games ( e.g. Starcraft ) , where you can not just construct a graph of possible states . Please explain like I'm five.","['In a computer game, the AI (artificial intelligence) is responsible for controlling the actions of computer-controlled characters in the game. In a real-time strategy game like Starcraft, the AI might control the actions of individual units or entire armies.There are a few different ways that game AIs can work, but one common method is to use a system called ""decision trees."" In a decision tree, the AI considers a number of different options that it could take, and then chooses the one that it thinks will be most effective based on the current situation in the game.For example, in Starcraft, the AI might consider whether it should build more units, expand to a new part of the map, or try to attack the player\'s base. It would then choose the option that it thinks will be most likely to succeed, based on the current state of the game.Other game AIs might use more complex techniques, such as machine learning algorithms, to make more sophisticated decisions. However, the basic idea is the same: the AI is trying to choose the best actions to take in order to achieve its goals in the game.']",1
"How do computer networks work ? I know that 's probably a really broad question . I guess I 'm specifically interested in definitions of things like IP addresses , LANs and routers and all that computer jargon . Explain like I'm five.","['Every computer on a network needs to have a unique identifying number , which is the IP ( Internet Protocol ) address . Actually , the IP address is n\'t the address of the computer itself , but rather the address of the computer \'s network interface . A router is a device that connects computers to each other . As such , it has lots of interfaces ( sockets ) into which you can plug a network cable . The outside internet connection will have an IP address allocated to it by the ISP , and all the internal network connections will have their IP addresses allocated to them by the router . Certain ranges of IP addresses are reserved for internal networks , and one such range starts with 192.168 - so your outside IP address may be something like 1.2.3.4 , your router \'s internal IP address may be something like 192.168.0.1 , and your router will allocate IP addresses to the devices on your network , maybe 192.168.0.2 for the PC , 192.168.0.3 for your phone , 192.168.0.4 for your XBox and so on . The router \'s main job is to "" route "" traffic around the network . It knows if a request for a web page has come from your PC it \'ll route the reply back to your PC . If the request for something else ( game data for example ) has come from the XBox , the reply goes to the XBox . "" Port Forwarding "" is the process of telling your router to send specific traffic to a particular device on your network . So if you \'re running a game server on your PC on port 23456 , you need to tell the router to send all data on that port to your PC and not to any of the other devices . LAN just stands for Local Area Network , which is the sort of setup I \'ve described above . The opposite is WAN ( Wide Area Network ) which kinda works the same way but some of the devices will be further away from the router ( in an office building on the other side of town , for example ) .', 'lets see . you can say that the IP is your address , like your house address . Then your mac ( the serial number of your network card ) is your name in this metaphor . LAN ( or WAN - wide area network , might be more accurate ) would then be your neighborhood and the internet a bunch of "" connected "" neighborhoods making a city ( the internet ) . Sending a letter ( a packet ) would then use your public address ( your IP ) . This IP would lead to your house ( your router / a LAN - local area network too ) . Here your router would look up your name ( mac address ) and send the packet to you . When you download stuff you normally send a letter saying you would like to receive something from someone else ( their IP ) , then they send a letter back saying OK , then you and that person send letter back and forth ( a hand - shake , how a TCP connection is established ) . Or maybe you would like to be an ass and just send info to everyone , so you have a picture you really like and send it to all addresses you come across , not waiting for a replay . This is called a UDP ( no hand - shake or connection establishment )', 'So we \'ll avoid the technical low - level details for two reasons : 1 . They are n\'t really important to you unless you \'re in an engineering discipline 2 . I do n\'t know them enough to give you a good answer :) . So we have data that \'s sent across cables in a specific way . We \'ll start there . A Local Area Network is a group of computers that are connected to eachother generally in a small geographic area , like you and your friends at your house . When each of you send messages to the internet the websites do n\'t necessarily know which of you in your house is actually sending the message . When something is sent back your router is smart enough to know "" Bob was talking to this site , so the response from there should go to bob "" . It "" routes "" messages to the people who they are supposed to go to . By doing that you can have multiple things on the same internet connection . An IP address is basically like a street address . Your computer has an IP addres , you can find it by googling "" what s my ip "" . Any message sent to that IP address could end up at your computer ( or at least at your router , which may or may not send it on to you ) .']",0

It follows language rules as defined in [ formal language theory ] ( URL_0 ) , which means each statement of code is unambiguous and contains other properties that a computer program can "" parse "" it and build a symbolic representation of the code in memory .

This program is called a compiler , and it is effectively a translator . It \'s programmed itself with rules for properly choosing the right opcode and organizing them appropriately to make a program . What \'s an opcode , really ? It \'s an integer . Your CPU has several inputs and outputs called registers , and when we talk about a 64 bit CPU , we \'re talking about how big some of the registers are . Each of the inputs and outputs have specific roles , and one of them is the instruction register .

Now that we have really good expressive languages and really good programs that transform the expressive languages into machine language , very few people ever work with the machine language on a regular basis .', 'Well , there are a couple different things going on here : Machine code is a very basic set of commands that move bits around in the registers in processors , turning ones into zeroes and performing basic calculations .

"How do computers check simple strings as if A = B ? We humans can easily check if two numbers or sentences are the same , but ho do computers , at their deepest level , know how to compare things ? Please explain like I'm five.","['Computers can check if two strings are the same by comparing each character in the string. For example, if we have the two strings ""cat"" and ""cat,"" the computer would first compare the characters ""c"" and ""c.""

Again, since these characters are the same, the computer would move on to the final pair of characters, ""t"" and ""t."" Since all of the characters are the same, the computer would determine that the strings are equal.Now, how does the computer actually perform this comparison? At the most basic level, computers use something called transistors to store and process information. Transistors are tiny electronic switches that can be turned on or off, and they can be used to represent the two digits in the binary number system (0 and 1). So when the computer is comparing two strings, it is actually performing a series of on/off comparisons using transistors.I hope this helps to explain things!

After you \'ve done this hundreds of times , you get very good at it and can do it at a glance . Computers do the same thing but never get any better at it . Instead of using decimal digits , most represent numbers as a string of [ binary digits ] ( URL_0 ) ( "" bits "" for short ) . There \'s a circuit in the processor that puts the bits from both numbers side by side , checks each corresponding pair of bits to see if they \'re the same and sets a flag that indicates whether or not the comparison found them all the same .

It \'s not perfect of course , but since a new seed is used each time it \'s ran it \'s not really obvious it \'s different from actually random things , like a dice roll . Some actual casino equipment use some unpredictable things , like ball bounces , or similar stuff , as the "" seed "" to get the result ( jackpot or nothing or somewhere between ) so it \'s random indirectly .', 'You \'re getting good answers for how it \'s typically done , so I \'m not going to repeat that . However , there \'s another very interesting aspect to this question . Getting * actually * random numbers from a computer is extremely difficult . The time - based calculations used most of the time are more than sufficient for video games , but they \'re technically "" psuedo - random . "" They look random to a casual glance , but if you look too closely you \'ll start to see predictable patterns . This makes them unsuitable for a few very critical purposes . In particular , licensed gambling with real money , and cryptography ( secret codes ) require much more randomness . There are probably other examples , but I ca n\'t think of them right now . If you \'re working with these critical tasks , you need a source of truly random numbers ; something that wo n\'t form any kind of consistent pattern . You really ca n\'t do it * just * with a computer ; you need some sort of analog , physical component to get anything like true randomness . There are some really interesting ways to do this . You can have the computer "" listen "" to a radio frequency in between stations ( essentially listening to static ) or monitor radioactive decay . Mechanical methods can be surprisingly good , as well ; regular old dice ( of good quality ) are surprisingly random , and they get better in larger numbers . Roulette wheels and coin flips are other possibilities . Of course , you can get truly random numbers without going to this kind of effort , because other people have already done the heavy lifting . You just send a request to [ URL_2 ] ( URL_1 ) . It \'s really odd to think of a list of numbers as a commodity , but they \'re so hard to make properly without specialized equipment that it \'s perfectly legitimate to outsource the work . EDIT : [ Here is ] ( URL_3 ) a really good example of random vs psuedo - random . The first image is a chart generated from values generated by URL_0 , and the second is a chart of values from the Windows random number generator - the same one used in computer games . They both look pretty much like static , and you can see how they \'d both be unpredictable enough to figure out how much damage you did to that orc , or whether your shot missed . But at the same time , when you look closely you can see a very clear pattern in the Windows random numbers . If you were doing something really important , those numbers would not be random enough , and you would need to use the better source .', 'Generally , things only appear to be random . Usually it \'s based on certain inputs that change and are put through a formula so the result seems random but the same inputs would yield the same results .

So if for example you \'re playing slot machines and you hit "" Spin "" and the time is 09:54:35 am and you take the last digit ( 5 ) and put it in for a different equation for each slot , say 1+x , 2 + 2x , and 4+x , and you get 6 , 12 , and 7 ... and each of those represent a different picture , you have 3 different apparently random results .

"How do computers read and "" produce "" the 1 and 0 they use to send commands ? I understand they use 1 's and 0 's , but where do they come form , and what exactly are they ? Explain like I'm five.","['Well the 1s and 0s are ways we have of thinking about information as if it could only be one of two different things . Exactly what we represent with which bit is n\'t important , as long as you understand that 1 is not 0 , and 0 is not 1 . Where they come from , on the other hand , is from any number of places a computer can interact with . For example , computers run on electricity , so when a computer wants to send information from one place to another it sends these "" pulses "" of electricity over a wire . A higher voltage pulse will mean a 1 , and a lower voltage pulse will mean a 0 . But there are other parts of a computer that still use 0s and 1s that are n\'t electric , like the hard drive . The hard drive stores 1s and 0s by changing the magnetic poles of small parts of a metal disk . Positive and negative charges would be 1s or 0s . So you can see how these real - life things can be changed to represent bits . Now you \'re probably wondering why , and what significance do bits have ? How can a 1 or a 0 be turned into important information ? Well , I \'m lazy , and I happen to already have an ELI5 explaining the nature of information to someone who was asking how DNA can be turned into information : URL_0 However , in summary , we use combinations of bits and say that different combinations have different meanings . So we might say that 0010 means the number 2 , and 0011 means the number 3 ( which it does , and there is strange math involved that requires re - learning how to count ) . From there , as long as everyone agrees that this is the case and these combinations do mean these things , we can start to make bigger groups of these bits that can be interpreted as instructions that can make computers do different things . Hope this helps ! EDIT : confusing sentence structure fixed', ""The way it worked in original computers was that you had racks of vacuum tubes wired up together which would make up the computers memory . Each one of these vacuum tubes is a single bit ; that is , a single on / off , yes / no , 1/0 . The computer could read and write the on / off state and represent it as 1 's and 0 's . Now with disk ~~and solid state~~ hard drives the concept is the same but instead of checking the on / off state of a vacuum tube , it checks the magnetization of the disk . edit : TIL solid state drives are a whole different beast ."", 'Computers do n\'t necessarily "" produce "" 1 \'s and 0 \'s in the sense that they do n\'t manufacture them . Rather , they "" present "" hardware states that are interpreted as numbers . By state , I do n\'t mean a state like Texas , I mean a particular condition that a hardware piece is in at a specific time . For example , think of a light switch . It can be in either two states : up or down . For the sake of this example , consider up to be on , and down to be off . The state ( or condition ) of the switch is determined by the physical position of the switch . Now , flipping the switch does n\'t produce 1 \'s and 0 \'s , but we can interpret the position of the switch such that on=1 and off=0 . An item that can only have two states can be considered binary . In computers , a single binary unit is referred to as a bit . Multiple bits can be grouped together to store numbers larger than 1 . When this happens we are using base - two ( binary ) counting . When you count with your fingers , you \'re essentially using base-10 ( decimal ) counting that you \'re familiar with . Now , think of a wall with one of those panels that have two light switches on them . Again , flipping the switches does n\'t produce 1 \'s or 0 \'s , but we \'re going to interpret the position of each switch as to represent a 1 or 0 . With two switches there are four possible combinations or 2 X 2 = 4 or , more accurately , 2 ^ 2 = 4 : * Switch 1 : on or off * Switch 2 : on or off Although we have 4 possible states , we typically consider the state with everything off as 0 . * State 1 : Switch 1 off and Switch 2 off = 0 * State 2 : Switch 1 on and Switch 2 off = 1 * State 3 : Switch 1 off and Switch 2 on = 2 * State 4 : Switch 1 on and Switch 2 on = 3 In computers , a cluster of 8 bits ( think switches ) is called a byte . With a byte , we can have up to 256 possible states since we can have up to 256 different possible combinations of bits being on or off . There are many different types of hardware for storing binary data , but they essentially can all be thought of as machines with lots and lots and lots of tiny switches in them . In computers , everything is based on binary numbers . In order to keep everything being one giant confusing number , we reserve groups of bits for different purposes . To explain this , I \'ll use a city metaphor . Feel free to draw things out on a piece of paper as you follow along . Imagine you are standing outside of a single story building , at night , with 8 windows in a line . If the light in a room is turned on , the room will light up . Think of each room as a bit . If you see it lit up , you interpret it as a 1 . If it \'s dark , you interpret it as 0 . Since you have 8 bits , the building effectively represents a byte of data . Now imagine the same building , but with 2 floors instead of 1 . You have 2 rows of 8 windows , with each window representing a bit . Remember how I said earlier that you can have 256 possible combinations with 8 bits ? Now we have 2 rows of 8 bits , or 16 bits . With 16 bits , we can have 2 ^ 16 = 65,536 possible combinations , which is also the maximum value we can store ( all bits are turned on ) . Lets designate this building as "" Storage 1 "" . Now , imagine an identical 2 story building right next to it called "" Storage 2 "" . Now we have 2 buildings of 16 bits , or 32 bits total . However , we \'ve effectively reserved each group of 16 bits into separate groups . Next , we have a 3rd building with a single story of 2 windows , or 2 bits , called "" op_code "" and a 4th building with 4 floors of 8 windows . This single building effectively contains 32 bits by itself . We \'ll call this one "" result "" . Result is different than storage 1 and 2 and op - code in that it \'s read - only . Imagine the building is locked and you do n\'t have the key to get in . As a result , you ca n\'t set the switches yourself to turn the lights on and off , you can only look at them . Finally , we \'ll have a small square building with no windows . We \'ll call this one "" compute "" . Inside there are special switches called logic gates . Logic gates take 1 or more input switches and usually have a singular output switch that is read - only . This effectively means that while you can set the input switch or switches , you ca n\'t set the output switch , only look at it . Feel free to look up the different types of logic gates yourself . For right now , it \'s sufficient to say that logic gates can be combined and arranged in different ways to perform mathematical operations . To recap : two identical 2 - story buildings containing 16 windows each called storage 1 and storage 2 , a 4 - story building containing 32 windows by itself called result a small square building called compute , and finally a single story building with 2 windows in a row , called op_code . You can think of each of these buildings as a representation of a type of computer chip . Modern computers use special chips called "" system on chip "" meaning a single chip has several internal "" chips "" inside of it . Each of these "" system on chips "" is like an electronic city unto itself . However , computer chips do n\'t have eyes and ca n\'t "" see "" bits . Instead , they are wired together so that when a bit is on , electricity flows through it . Imagine that each window in storage one and storage 2 has an extension cord connecting it to the compute building , All 16 wires from each storage building are plugged into a single side of the compute building . Storage 1 is plugged into side one of compute building and storage 2 is plugged into side 2 of compute building . If you were to turn on the a light in one of the storage buildings , it would also send power through that room \'s extension cord to the compute building . Now , imagine that the op - code building has 2 wires ( one for each window ) wired up to the third side of the compute building . Finally , the 4th side of the compute building is wired up to the result building . Since op - code has 2 windows , we have 4 possible combinations . We \'re going to let each combination represent a command : * 1 : off - off ( 00 ) is do nothing * 2 : off - on ( 01 ) is add storage 1 and storage 2 * 3 : on - off ( 10 ) is subtract storage 2 from storage 1 * 4 : and on - on ( 11 ) is multiply storage 1 and storage 2 . All operations except off - off cause the lights in the result building to reflect the binary result of the operation . For example , using the add op - code ( off - on ) causes the lights in result to indicate the sum of storage 1 and storage 2 . As an example , Imagine that you running around this imaginary town . You turn on the lights in storage one and storage two such that the windows look like this ( 1 is lit - up ): * Storage 1 : * 00000000 * 00000011 * Storage 2 : * 00000000 * 00000001 Next you run to the op code building and flip the light switches so that it has the following binary value : 01 Remember , 01 is to add . Unseen to you , 01 has allowed the power from storage 1 and storage 2 to be routed to the logic gates used for addition in the compute building . Consequently the windows on the result building look like this : * 00000000 * 00000000 * 00000000 * 00000100 By doing so , you \'ve effectively added 11 ( binary for 3 ) and 1 ( binary for 1 ) , resulting in 100 ( binary for 4 ) . You should now have a very basic understanding of how computers operate . Lots of bits , groups of which are reserved for different things , are wired together such that other groups of bits act as commands to perform computations . If you want to understand how text and other things are represented , look at an ASCII chart . Effectively , a byte is used for a single character . Each possible combination of the bits within the byte is reserved to represent a different character . It \'s still all binary numbers , is just that when people design computers to be compatible with each other , they agree to bind their designs to conform to standards like ASCII .

As the sugar spins through the hole, it hardens into tiny little threads that look like a cloud. The machine blows these threads of sugar out of the hole and into a big pile, and that pile is what we call cotton candy.']",1

How do countries become superpowers ? What leads a country to become a superpower ? What parameters determine if a country can become a superpower ? Explain like I'm five.,"[""A superpower is a country that is very powerful and influential in the world. There are a few key things that can help a country become a superpower: A strong economy: A country needs to have a strong and growing economy in order to be able to afford to build up its military, invest in new technologies, and support the needs of its people. A strong military: A country needs to have a strong military in order to protect itself and its interests, and to be able to project its power around the world. A large population: A country with a large population has more people to work, create, and defend the country. This can help it become more powerful and influential. Access to resources: A country with access to important resources like oil, minerals, and fertile land can use these resources to fuel its economy and build its military. Strong international relationships: A country that is able to build strong relationships with other countries can use those relationships to its advantage, such as by getting other countries to support its policies or by trading with them. It's important to note that becoming a superpower is not easy and it takes time. It requires a country to work hard and make smart decisions to build up its strength and influence.""]",1

This is why credit unions are able to offer lower rates on loans.A dividend is a distribution of a portion of a credit union's profits to its members. Credit unions are non-profit organizations, so any profits they make are returned to their members in the form of dividends on savings accounts and other types of accounts.

How do currency markets work? What factors are behind why currencies go up or down?,"[""Currency markets, also known as foreign exchange (forex) markets, are where currencies are bought and sold. Currencies are traded in pairs, with one currency being bought and another sold at the same time. The value of a currency is determined by supply and demand, and currency markets are influenced by a variety of factors, including:Interest rates: Higher interest rates tend to make a currency more attractive to investors, as they can earn higher returns on their investments. As a result, currencies with higher interest rates tend to appreciate in value.Inflation: If a country's inflation rate is higher than that of its trading partners, its currency may depreciate in value. This is because high inflation reduces the purchasing power of a currency, making it less attractive to investors.Economic growth: Strong economic growth can lead to an appreciation in the value of a currency, as it indicates that a country's economy is expanding and may be able to pay back its debts.Political stability: Political stability can be a key factor in determining the value of a currency. If a country is perceived as being politically stable, it may attract more investment, which can lead to an appreciation in the value of its currency.Government debt: High levels of government debt can lead to a depreciation in the value of a currency, as investors may be concerned about the government's ability to pay back its debts.Central bank policy: Central banks can influence the value of a currency through their monetary policy decisions, such as setting interest rates or purchasing or selling government bonds.Exchange rate regimes: The exchange rate regime of a country, or how its currency is pegged to another currency, can also influence its value. For example, if a country's currency is pegged to the US dollar, it will tend to follow the value of the US dollar.Trade balances: A country's trade balance, or the difference between the value of its exports and imports, can also influence the value of its currency. If a country has a large trade surplus, it may lead to an appreciation in the value of its currency, as it is able to sell more goods and services to other countries.""]",1
How do darknet dealers get drugs like cocaine and heroin in the first place ? Like where does the drug come from in the first place ? How 'd they make it and stuff ? Explain like I'm five. ,"['The same way traditional drug dealers do . From producers , or importers ( who get them from producers ) . The drug supply chain does not change , what changes is how the product gets to the end user . Think of it like Amazon vs a general store . They both buy products from suppliers and wholesalers but they retail the products very differently .', 'My question is how do people actually get this stuff delivered ? How is it not caught every time ..', 'Cocaine is made from coca leaves . Opiates ( such as heroin ) are made from opium resin , from the sap of poppy flowers . Coca is a bushy plant that is native to South America , and grown mostly there . ( Coca is not to be confused with cacao , which is the plant that chocolate comes from . ) Poppies are a flower that is native to the Mediterranean region , but is today most heavily grown in central and southern Asia . Poppy flowers that you can buy at garden shops are actually the same species as "" opium poppies "" , and they do contain opiates . It \'s legal to grow them for decorative purposes , but not to extract opium from them . ( The bright orange "" California poppy "" does not contain opium . ) Similarly , poppy seeds that are used in pastries do contain a tiny amount of opiates . It \'s a myth that eating one poppyseed bagel will make you test positive for opiates on a drug test . However , some European pastries are stuffed with poppyseed - based filling and will certainly register on a urine test . A blood test can tell the difference between heroin ( or fentanyl ) and poppyseeds , though . ( Historically , poppy seeds were a byproduct of opium production . Opium has been used as a medicine for pain since the dawn of recorded history in Europe . There are sculptures from Minoan Crete depicting the poppy as a goddess of healing . By the way , cannabis is from the Caucasus , and the Greek historian Herodotus was kind of weirded out by how the people there — the Scythians — used it : they would burn it in bonfires to get high on the smoke . ) Anyway , these plants are grown secretly , or with the cooperation ( bribery ) of local governments . Extracting cocaine from coca leaves , or crude opium from poppies , does n\'t have to be much more complicated than extracting caffeine from coffee beans or tea leaves . But for the drug trade , it \'s done with chemicals to make it faster and more efficient . Turning opium into heroin is a bunch more complicated and involves secret chemical labs . Opium is ancient , but heroin was only invented in the 20th century . Extracting opium from poppies involves letting the flower go to seed , and then scratching or cutting the seed - pod to make it ooze sap . The sap contains a mixture of many different chemicals , some of which are already drugs ( primarily morphine ) and others that can be chemically changed to make drugs . Extracting cocaine from coca leaves involves soaking them in water and chemicals to get the cocaine to dissolve out of the leaves . It \'s worth noting that coca leaves and poppy extracts can be used as drugs without any further preparation . Native people in Colombia , Bolivia , and Peru have chewed coca leaves as a mild stimulant for thousands of years . The ancient Greeks and Persians used opium extracted from poppies with alcohol from wine . However , coca leaves and poppy pods are very bulky ; refined cocaine and heroin are much more compact and therefore easier to smuggle . There is a general rule that when drugs are made illegal , people find ways to make the drugs stronger , because stronger drugs are easier to smuggle . In the 1920s , when the U.S. prohibited alcohol , the production of beer and wine basically shut down , but gin and whiskey became more popular . Cocaine is stronger than coca leaves , and crack is stronger again than cocaine . Modern cannabis is much stronger than the "" Indian hemp "" that has been grown for thousands of years . Some of the opiates used today , such as carfentanil , are so much stronger than plain opium that they were originally invented not even as painkillers , but to be used in tranquilizer darts on elephants !']",0

This can involve changes to the way elections are conducted, such as switching to a different voting system like the Single Transferable Vote (STV). In the United States, electoral reform is typically initiated by lawmakers at the state or federal level. If a bill proposing a change to the voting system is passed by the legislature and signed into law by the executive, the new system will be implemented in future elections.The process of changing a voting system can be difficult, as it often requires the support of a majority of lawmakers and can be controversial. Some people may oppose electoral reform because they believe that the current system works well, or because they are concerned about the potential impact on their political party.The Single Transferable Vote (STV) is a voting system that is used in some elections, including some elections in the United States. In STV, voters rank candidates in order of preference. If a candidate receives a majority of the first preference votes, they are elected. If no candidate receives a majority, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and their votes are transferred to the next preferred candidate on the voter\'s ballot. This process continues until a candidate receives a majority of the votes. STV is designed to ensure that the winner of an election represents the majority of voters and to allow voters to express their preferences more accurately. Some people believe that STV is a more fair and democratic voting system than the current system used in the United States, which is called the ""first past the post"" system. In the first past the post system, the candidate who receives the most votes wins, regardless of whether they have a majority of the votes.']",1

This means that they are able to reduce the size of the data while still maintaining the same quality. There are a few different ways that they can do this. \nOne way is by finding more efficient ways to represent the data. For example, instead of representing each pixel in an image as a separate piece of information, they might use patterns or colors to represent groups of pixels. This can help to reduce the amount of data that needs to be stored. \nAnother way is by finding more efficient ways to compress the data. This might involve using algorithms that are more efficient at finding patterns in the data, or using techniques like predictive coding to better estimate what data is most important to keep. \nFinally, developers can also make new codecs (compression algorithms for audio and video) better by improving the way that they handle different types of data. For example, they might create codecs that are better at compressing video with a lot of fast-moving action, or codecs that are better at compressing audio with a wide range of frequencies. \nOverall, the goal of compression algorithms is to reduce the amount of data that needs to be stored or transmitted, while still maintaining the quality of the original data.

If diamonds are valuable ( through artificial scarcity ) and very small , why are they not stolen in large amounts by impoverished workers ? Explain like I'm five.","[""A few things to keep in mind : * Diamonds are rarely cleanly unearthed by workers . The workers break up rock which is carted out of the mine for external industrial processing ( further smashing and washing with chemicals ) . * Uncut diamonds are n't nearly as valuable as cut , polished stones . * Also , uncut diamonds are hard for a non - professional to identify and value . It 's easy to mistake them for totally mundane minerals ( and vice versa ) . This is even more true when you 're working in a mineshaft , with little to no light . So at the outset , it 's very hard to come by and identify loose diamonds . It 's not like Minecraft or Terraria . You do n't have valuable diamonds just lying around for the taking . But lets say Miner Joe comes across a small diamond every now and again , which is small enough to smuggle out of the mine . The issue facing him now is whether it 's worth the risk . * * His potential take :* Joe 's diamond is small , uncut , and ungraded , so it 's not exactly a big - ticket item . Plus he has to sell it in his impoverished home country , so he 's not going to get U.S. retail prices . Not even close . Furthermore , if he 's a diamond miner , his buyer may well know that and probably leverage it against him ( i.e. , the buyer could threaten to turn him in ) . So Joe probably takes another hit on the price or maybe he asks a middle man to sell it for him ( for a cut ) . All told , I 'd wager that Joe gets a few hundred bucks for his diamond . Do n't get me wrong - that 's a sizeable chunk of money . But let 's see what he has to lose ... * * The risks :* There are a number of ways Joe could get caught . He could be seen pocketing the diamond by a supervisor , security personnel , or even a fellow miner ( who is probably rewarded for reporting him ) . He also runs the risk of a random inspection - even an X - Ray - as he leaves the mining camp . If he 's caught , he 'll be fired and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law . Given the fact that diamond mining is probably one of the most steady , full - time jobs available to him , and the fact that his country 's justice and penal systems are n't known to be merciful , Joe stands to lose quite a bit . In other words , I think the reward : risk ratio is pretty damn low . I do n't doubt that theft is still a substantial problem , but I think that the opportunity and the benefits for such theft are probably substantially lower than most people think . I 've also read that De Beers and its competitors actually buy up the uncut diamonds sold into the pawn shops and markets in the communities around their mines . I guess that 's the cost of doing business if you 're trying to control the supply . But I 'd also wager that their buying clout can help control prices in this trade ."", 'Randomly X - raying workers when they leave . And severe penalties for anybody who gets caught .

The quartz crystal vibrates at a very stable and precise frequency, and this vibration is used to create electrical pulses that keep the clock running.However, even though quartz crystals are very stable, they can still drift slightly over time. This means that the electrical pulses they create may not be exactly the same frequency as they were when the clock was first set. As a result, the clock will slowly lose time.There are also other factors that can cause a digital clock to lose time, such as the battery running low or the clock being exposed to extreme temperatures.To fix this problem, you can simply reset the clock to the correct time.

How do digital devices know how much energy is left in their batteries ? . Explain like I'm five.,"[""You 've got multiple methods for that . Let 's make an analog here : A battery is like a tank of water , with a faucet at the bottom . You can make the battery ' do work ' by opening the faucet and holding e.g. a small water weel underneath it . You ca n't look into the tank : how do you know how much water is left ? One of the simplest ( to implement ) methods is by measuring the voltage . In the tank example , you do this by looking at the pressure the water has when you open the faucet . If the tank is full , the water pressure will be bigger than when the tank is empty , and by looking at it , you can guess how much of the tank still is full . Batteries work the same way , for example an 1.5V battery may be 1.6V when full and 1.1V when almost empty . A digital device will take this voltage and will look up how much power a battery usually has left at that point . That then gets showed to the user . The other way is to just calculate how much energy the battery has left by measuring how much energy you 've already counted . The tank equivalent would be by putting a measuring device that can measure the amount of liters that flow out of the tank . If your tank holds 100 liters at full capacity and the measuring device indicates 50 liters are already used , you know the tank still is half full . In battery technology , the ' measuring device ' that does this is called a coulomb counter , and you can find them e.g. in smartphones . They do n't always work as expected ( but usually are quite precise ): for example , they wo n't see if energy from a battery disappears in another way . For example , LiIon batteries will lose quite some power from being used at low temperatures , and the coulomb couter does n't catch that . You can see that because some phones tend to go from half - full to almost completely dead in seconds when they are used in a cold environment Edit : Wow , I wake up to gold and a full inbox . If this interests you , also read the child comments , people have brought up some interesting facts there ."", 'I worked for a summer as a fuel gauging engineer for a major cellphone manufacturer in northern Europe . I was responsible for assessing the fuel gauging algorithm in a new smartphone model . The battery holds charge - what we want to measure is how much charge it holds , we call this the "" state of charge "" , or SoC for short . This is done in two ways . We can measure the voltage over the battery \'s poles , just like /u / Spritetm has described before me . However , once the battery is changing states ( whether it \'s charging or discharging ) , we suffer from a phenomenon called "" hysteresis "" . Hysteresis is simply the fact that once we \'ve got the battery discharging , if we stop discharging it ( say , by turning the phone off ) , it will keep on discharging by itself for a short while . Like if you are pushing a wagon , then suddenly stop - the wagon keeps rolling . It works the other way for charging - so it does n\'t matter if you push or pull the wagon , it will keep going in that direction for a short while after you stop . What does this mean to us ? It means that any voltage measurement done when the battery is charging or discharging will not correspond to the actual SoC - the battery must be "" relaxed "" for the voltage measurement to work . Relazing a cellphone battery completely can take 24 hours , but a "" close enough "" result can be had after just 1 - 3 hours . Typically , voltage measurements are only done on "" wake from sleep "" or "" turn on "" - that \'s why you get weird spikes in your battery usage curves , sometimes they drop sharply or even go up ! That \'s because you \'ve woken the phone from sleep and the fuel gauging algorithm is resetting by making a voltage measurement . When the phone is running , we thus can not rely on voltage measurements . Instead , we use a coloumb counter to measure the current from or to the battery - we know how much charge is "" leaving "" or "" entering "" the battery . This , however , also carries with it a problem - any measurement on the current will have a small error . Since we make many of these measurements per second , the error will start to accumulate . We call this "" drift "" or "" measurement drift "" . This is no biggie however - we simply measure the current from / to the battery when the phone is in use , and then calibrate by doing a voltage measurement on wake from sleep or other opportune times . For electric car batteries and other larger charge carrying arrays , a method known as Kalman filtering ( used in control theory ) is used - this is a quite advanced method that depends on studying the battery \'s state of charge by discharging and relaxing it many times ( the relaxation may take 24 - 48 hours , making these measurements tedious and costly ) , making a curve of the SoC as a function of voltage . Then , a function fitting this curve is created - this function does n\'t necessarily have anything to do with real physics , it just needs to fit the curve somewhat and be a function of voltage . We then "" predict "" where the curve is going to go when we use the battery , and use this made - up prediction to correct our actual measurements . This can not be done on cell batteries however , because they are highly non - linear in nature . Maybe this was n\'t as though you were 5 , but I tried my best !

How do disputed debts work on credit reports?,"[""When a consumer disputes a debt that appears on their credit report, the credit reporting agency, also known as a credit bureau, is required to investigate the dispute. This process is governed by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), which sets out certain rights and responsibilities for consumers and credit bureaus when it comes to credit reporting.Here is a general overview of how disputed debts work on credit reports:The consumer disputes a debt: If a consumer believes that a debt listed on their credit report is incorrect or that they do not owe the debt, they can dispute the debt with the credit bureau. This can be done online, by phone, or in writing.The credit bureau investigates the dispute: When a credit bureau receives a dispute, it is required to investigate the claim and determine whether the information on the credit report is accurate. This may involve contacting the creditor or debt collector that reported the debt to verify the information.The credit bureau updates the credit report: If the credit bureau determines that the information on the credit report is accurate, it will not make any changes to the report. However, if the credit bureau finds that the information is inaccurate or incomplete, it must remove or correct the information on the credit report.It's important to note that disputing a debt on a credit report does not necessarily mean that the consumer does not owe the debt. It simply means that the consumer is challenging the accuracy of the information on the credit report. If the credit bureau determines that the information is accurate, the consumer may still be responsible for paying the debt.If you have questions about a disputed debt on your credit report, it may be helpful to speak with a consumer law attorney or a credit counselor.

How do dividend reinvestment purchases work?,"[""Dividend reinvestment is a way for investors to automatically use their dividends to purchase additional shares of the same stock, rather than receiving the dividends as cash. When a company declares a dividend, investors who have chosen dividend reinvestment will see their dividends used to buy additional shares of the stock, rather than being paid out in cash. This can be a useful way for investors to gradually accumulate more shares of a particular stock, without having to make additional cash purchases.Here's how dividend reinvestment works:An investor owns shares of a company that declares a dividend.The investor has chosen to participate in the company's dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP).When the dividend is paid out, the investor's account will be credited with the value of the dividend in cash.Instead of receiving the cash, the investor's account will be used to purchase additional shares of the same stock at the current market price.The investor's account will be updated to reflect the additional shares purchased, and the investor will now own more shares of the stock.It's important to note that dividend reinvestment plans may come with fees and restrictions, so it's a good idea to carefully review the terms and conditions before signing up for a DRIP. Some companies may also offer partial dividend reinvestment, where investors can choose to receive a portion of their dividends in cash and use the remainder to purchase additional shares."", ""Dividend reinvestment is a way for investors to automatically use their dividends to purchase additional shares of the company's stock, rather than receiving the dividends in cash.

If you have elected to participate in the company's dividend reinvestment plan, the dividends will be automatically used to purchase additional shares of the company's stock, rather than being paid to you in cash.The additional shares are added to your account and appear on your statement.

How do dividends of the underlying security in a security futures contract affect the security futures price?,"[""When a company declares a dividend on its underlying stock, the price of the stock typically decreases by an amount equal to the dividend on the ex-dividend date, which is the date on which the stock begins trading without the dividend. This is because the dividend is paid out of the company's profits, and the value of the company's profits is reflected in the stock price.The price of a security futures contract is derived from the price of the underlying stock, so the dividend will also affect the price of the security futures contract. The value of the security futures contract is based on the value of the underlying stock minus the value of the dividend that will be paid out. Therefore, when the stock goes ex-dividend, the price of the security futures contract will typically decrease by an amount equal to the dividend.It's important to note that the effect of a dividend on the price of a security futures contract can be more complex than this simple explanation, as other factors such as supply and demand, market conditions, and the current level of interest rates can also affect the price of the contract.""]",1

How do doctors find out a persons allergy ? Do they take blood samples and can tell from that ? I 'm assuming that they just do n't shove a peanut in your face to see if you have nut allergy . Please explain like I'm five.,"[""Doctors can use several different methods to find out if a person has allergies. One common method is to do a skin prick test. During this test, a small amount of an allergen (such as a substance that a person might be allergic to) is placed on the skin, and then a needle is used to prick the skin through the allergen. If the person is allergic to the allergen, they will develop a raised bump or rash on their skin. \nAnother way to test for allergies is to do a blood test. During this test, a blood sample is taken from the person and sent to a laboratory, where it is tested for the presence of antibodies to specific allergens. Antibodies are proteins produced by the body's immune system in response to an allergen. If the person has allergies, their blood will contain high levels of these antibodies. \nIt's important to note that doctors do not usually test for allergies by exposing a person to the allergen directly. This is because allergies can cause serious reactions, such as difficulty breathing or a drop in blood pressure, and it would be dangerous to intentionally trigger these reactions. Instead, doctors use safer methods, such as skin prick tests and blood tests, to test for allergies.""]",1

Dogs are domesticated animals, which means they have been bred and raised by humans for thousands of years to be our companions, not our prey.

When a dog sees a human, especially a baby, it will often recognize that the human is not acting like prey, but rather like a member of the pack or a caregiver. This helps the dog understand that the human is not something to be hunted or eaten. Additionally, dogs are often fed and cared for by humans, which helps to strengthen the bond between them and reinforces the idea that humans are not a source of food.

Dogs have an incredibly strong sense of smell, and they can be trained to recognize these changes and alert their owner when their blood sugar levels are getting too high or too low.To train a dog to sense changes in a person's blood sugar levels, a trainer will first start by teaching the dog to associate the smell of a person's skin and sweat with different blood sugar levels. The trainer will use samples of skin and sweat from people with different blood sugar levels and help the dog learn to recognize the differences in smell.Once the dog has learned to recognize these differences, the trainer will then work on teaching the dog to alert their owner when they smell a change in blood sugar levels. This might involve the dog barking, jumping up on their owner, or touching their owner with their nose or paw.

To fully understand both AM and FM you need to know some math , but I will make a relatively simple description without using equations . First you need to understand that AM and FM are different things . The concept is the same , sending information through an electromagnetic wave , but the mechanism is different . I am going to focus on AM , because I think is a more intuitive understanding . Think of two waves , a pure sinusoidal signal at a fixed frequency : call this the "" carrier "" because that is what is going to take to "" carry "" the information . Whenever the carrier is the highest frequency , and is the tune on the radio , so I suppose that has a frequency of 100 MHz .

You add a little fuel somewhere in the process , which ends up igniting either from a spark plug or from the high pressure and temperature environment in the cylinder . This causes the pressure and temperature to further skyrocket , and that can be harnessed by allowing the working fluid of air and exhaust to expand against a piston connected to a crankshaft . Then , you blow out the remaining exhaust particles , which take up space that you 'd rather fill with fresh air ( again , oxygen ) in the next engine cycle . Repeat that at high speeds , having typically 10 - 200 combustion events every second per cylinder in the case of a piston - cylinder engine , or having one long continuous event in the case of a turbine ."", 'Your standard four - stroke engine runs as follows : stroke 1 : As the piston expands the chamber , fill it with a fuel / air mixture . stroke 2 : The piston compresses the chamber .

This process repeats , keeping the crankshaft spinning which ultimately causes the wheels of your vehicle to spin .', ""Well , you have 2 main types of engines : diesel and conventional . I 'll explain each in turn . First of all , your conventional engine usually runs on a four step process . Step 1 : Intake . The engine pulls in a mixture of fuel and air , which pushes the cylinder to its maximum volume . Step 2 : Compression . The piston pushes the mixture to a predetermined pressure ( which will cause a bigger bang ) . Step 3 : Combustion . The spark plug at the top of the cylinder ignites the mixture , pushing down the piston , which creates the power needed to run your car . Step 4 : Exhaust . The piston pushes the leftover mixture out of the cylinder . ( If you are using a much more inefficient two stroke engine , steps 1 and 4 happen at the same time , as well as steps 2 and 3 ) . Diesel engine : I wo n't go over the whole cycle again for the Diesel engine , but I 'll highlight the key differences . The fuel is obviously different , and this leads to the ability to compress the fuel to a much higher pressure . In fact , that 's the whole point of a Diesel engine . The spark plug ignites the fuel mixture for a conventional engine , but in a Diesel engine the fuel ignites spontaneously as soon as it reaches a certain pressure . Additional note : if you were to directly compare a Diesel engine to a conventional engine at the same exact temperature and pressure , the conventional would actually be more efficient . However , since the Diesel engine operates at such high pressures , the Diesel engine ends up being much more efficient than the conventional engine , I.E. You get much more bang for your buck .

"How do engines work ? It probably sounds kind of dumb , but I do n't have any mechanically savvy friends to explain these things to me . Explain like I'm five.","[""Sure, I can explain how engines work in a way that's easy to understand. An engine is a machine that converts energy into motion. It does this by burning fuel (like gasoline or diesel) and using the energy from the fuel to power a mechanical device. The most common type of engine is the internal combustion engine, which is used in cars, trucks, and other vehicles. It works like this: The fuel is mixed with air and injected into a cylinder (a small, hollow space inside the engine). The mixture is then ignited, causing a small explosion. This explosion pushes a piston (a metal rod) down inside the cylinder. The piston is connected to a crankshaft (a long, rotating rod). As the piston moves down, it turns the crankshaft. The crankshaft is connected to the wheels of the vehicle, so as it turns, it makes the wheels move. That's a very basic explanation of how an engine works, but there are many more parts and processes involved. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.""]",1
How do euro hedged index funds work?,"['When you invest in an S&P500 index fund that is priced in USD, the only major risk you bear is the risk associated with the equity that comprises the index, since both the equities and the index fund are priced in USD. The fund in your question, however, is priced in EUR. For a fund like this to match the performance of the S&P500, which is priced in USD, as closely as possible, it needs to hedge against fluctuations in the EUR/USD exchange rate. If the fund simply converted EUR to USD then invested in an S&P500 index fund priced in USD, the EUR-priced fund may fail to match the USD-priced fund because of exchange rate fluctuations. Here is a simple example demonstrating why hedging is necessary. I assumed the current value of the USD-priced S&P500 index fund is 1,600 USD/share. The exchange rate is 1.3 USD/EUR. If you purchase one share of this index using EUR, you would pay 1230.77 EUR/share:  If the S&P500 increases 10% to 1760 USD/share and the exchange rate remains unchanged, the value of the your investment in the EUR fund also increases by 10% (both sides of the equation are multiplied by 1.1):  However, the currency risk comes into play when the EUR/USD exchange rate changes. Take the 10% increase in the price of the USD index occurring in tandem with an appreciation of the EUR to 1.4 USD/EUR:  Although the USD-priced index gained 10%, the appreciation of the EUR means that the EUR value of your investment is almost unchanged from the first equation. For investments priced in EUR that invest in securities priced in USD, the presence of this additional currency risk mandates the use of a hedge if the indexes are going to track. The fund you linked to uses swap contracts, which I discuss in detail below, to hedge against fluctuations in the EUR/USD exchange rate. Since these derivatives aren\'t free, the cost of the hedge is included in the expenses of the fund and may result in differences between the S&P500 Index and the S&P 500 Euro Hedged Index.  Also, it\'s important to realize that any time you invest in securities that are priced in a different currency than your own, you take on currency risk whether or not the investments aim to track indexes. This holds true even for securities that trade on an exchange in your local currency, like ADR\'s or GDR\'s. I wrote an answer that goes through a simple example in a similar fashion to the one above in that context, so you can read that for more information on currency risk in that context.  There are several ways to investors, be they institutional or individual, can hedge against currency risk. iShares offers an ETF that tracks the S&P500 Euro Hedged Index and uses a over-the-counter currency swap contract called a month forward FX contract to hedge against the associated currency risk. In these contracts, two parties agree to swap some amount of one currency for another amount of another currency, at some time in the future. This allows both parties to effectively lock in an exchange rate for a given time period (a month in the case of the iShares ETF) and therefore protect themselves against exchange rate fluctuations in that period.  There are other forms of currency swaps, equity swaps, etc. that could be used to hedge against currency risk. In general, two parties agree to swap one quantity, like a EUR cash flow, payments of a fixed interest rate, etc. for another quantity, like a USD cash flow, payments based on a floating interest rate, etc. In many cases these are over-the-counter transactions, there isn\'t necessarily a standardized definition.  For example, if the European manager of a fund that tracks the S&P500 Euro Hedged Index is holding euros and wants to lock in an effective exchange rate of 1.4 USD/EUR (above the current exchange rate), he may find another party that is holding USD and wants to lock in the respective exchange rate of 0.71 EUR/USD. The other party could be an American fund manager that manages a USD-price fund that tracks the FTSE. By swapping USD and EUR, both parties can, at a price, lock in their desired exchange rates.  I want to clear up something else in your question too. It\'s not correct that the ""S&P 500 is completely unrelated to the Euro."" Far from it. There are many cases in which the EUR/USD exchange rate and the level of the S&P500 index could be related. For example: Troublesome economic news in Europe could cause the euro to depreciate against the dollar as European investors flee to safety, e.g. invest in Treasury bills. However, this economic news could also cause US investors to feel that the global economy won\'t recover as soon as hoped, which could affect the S&P500.  If the euro appreciated against the dollar, for whatever reason, this could increase profits for US businesses that earn part of their profits in Europe. If a US company earns 1 million EUR and the exchange rate is 1.3 USD/EUR, the company earns 1.3 million USD. If the euro appreciates against the dollar to 1.4 USD/EUR in the next quarter and the company still earns 1 million EUR, they now earn 1.4 million USD. Even without additional sales, the US company earned a higher USD profit, which is reflected on their financial statements and could increase their share price (thus affecting the S&P500). Combining examples 1 and 2, if a US company earns some of its profits in Europe and a recession hits in the EU, two things could happen simultaneously. A) The company\'s sales decline as European consumers scale back their spending, and B) the euro depreciates against the dollar as European investors sell euros and invest in safer securities denominated in other currencies (USD or not). The company suffers a loss in profits both from decreased sales and the depreciation of the EUR.  There are many more factors that could lead to correlation between the euro and the S&P500, or more generally, the European and American economies. The balance of trade, investor and consumer confidence, exposure of banks in one region to sovereign debt in another, the spread of asset/mortgage-backed securities from US financial firms to European banks, companies, municipalities, etc. all play a role.  One example of this last point comes from this article, which includes an interesting line: Among the victims of America’s subprime crisis are eight municipalities in Norway, which lost a total of $125 million through subprime mortgage-related investments. Long story short, these municipalities had mortgage-backed securities in their investment portfolios that were derived from, far down the line, subprime mortgages on US homes. I don\'t know the specific cities, but it really demonstrates how interconnected the world\'s economies are when an American family\'s payment on their subprime mortgage in, say, Chicago, can end up backing a derivative investment in the investment portfolio of, say, Hammerfest, Norway.']",0
How do euro hedged index funds work?,"['Euro hedged index funds are a type of investment vehicle that aims to reduce the impact of currency fluctuations on the returns of a portfolio. They do this by using financial instruments, such as currency forward contracts, to hedge against currency exchange rate risk.Here\'s how it works: Let\'s say an investor in the United States wants to invest in a European stock index, such as the Euro Stoxx 50. The investor could purchase a euro-denominated index fund, which would allow them to directly invest in the index. However, because the fund is denominated in euros, the investor would be exposed to currency exchange rate risk. If the value of the euro declines relative to the US dollar, the investor\'s returns could be negatively impacted.To mitigate this risk, the investor could opt for a euro hedged index fund instead. In this case, the fund would use financial instruments, such as currency forward contracts, to hedge against currency exchange rate risk. This means that the fund would effectively be ""locking in"" the current exchange rate between the euro and the US dollar. If the value of the euro declines relative to the US dollar, the investor\'s returns would be protected, as the fund would have already hedged against this risk.It\'s important to note that while euro hedged index funds can reduce currency exchange rate risk, they do not eliminate it completely. Additionally, they may involve transaction costs and other fees, which can impact the overall returns of the fund.']",1
How do exchanges match limit orders?,"[""The total limit book is a composite of all the orders on all of the exchanges. While it's uncommon for a limit order posted beyond the NBBO to fill outside of the NBBO, it does occur. For example, the best ask may be on exchange X, but for some reason the smart order routing algorithm may select exchange Y if it judges the net trade to be less costly, malfunctions, etc, and HFTs will immediately arbitrage the order between two exchanges, or the best order on exchange X disappears causing the order to fill above the NBBO. The system isn't perfect because there are multiple exchanges, but that eventuality is extremely rare with equities since nearly every exchange will have orders posted at the NBBO because exchange equity fee and rebate schedules are extremely competitive, nearly identical.  It is however more common with options since less exchanges as a percentage of the total will have orders posted at the NBBO because of very wide exchange rebate and fee schedules.

How do experts in photograph analysis know that a photo has n't been doctored ? Is there science to it ? Is it like a crime scene where you just have to infer something from certain clues and cues ? Please explain like I'm five.,"[""There are many ways that experts can tell if a photo has been doctored. One way is by looking at the pixels in the photo. When a photo is edited, it can often leave behind traces such as pixels that are a different color or in a different pattern than the surrounding pixels.

Another way experts can tell if a photo has been doctored is by looking for inconsistencies in the photo. For example, if the shadows in the photo don't match up with the way the light is hitting the objects in the photo, it could be a sign that the photo has been doctored.

How do experts in photograph analysis know that a photo has n't been doctored ? Is there science to it ? Is it like a crime scene where you just have to infer something from certain clues and cues ? Please explain like I'm five.,"['A bit of both . There can definitely be science to it : Science - If you * * adjust the "" levels "" * * ( hard to explain , but kind of like adjusting the contrast at different brightnesses ) you can sometimes physically see the modification . For example in a recent controversy , this photo won an award : [ "" Original "" ] ( URL_4 ) . Can you see what \'s wrong with it ? ( Clue : it \'s possible to see by looking closely at the right place ) If you said the plane has been photoshopped in , you \'d be right . And if you did n\'t already see it , maybe you can now . If not , how about we adjust the levels : [ Adjusted image ] ( URL_2 ) Well , that \'s dramatic , is n\'t it ? This is a fairly obvious one where , to be honest , the photoshopping was n\'t done that well - but it can still work pretty well for detecting this kind of image made from other images . This works because an image edit is done to fool the human eye - people will edit the picture enough to fool someone looking at it , and not much more . To counter it , we change things enough that we \'re limiting the amount of information . By removing the colour and bumping the contrast up , we can see small changes much more clearly . Then there are other techniques : you can * * compare the compression ratio on different parts of the image * * . Basically this involves looking at a group of pixels and ( with knowledge of how an image is compressed ) working out whether different areas of the image have different compression ratios by seeing how many mistakes there are . These ca n\'t be seen ( easily ) by the human eye , but can be calculated by a computer . Why does that matter ? Because if you can tell that two different part of the image have been compressed by different amounts , that \'s a pretty obvious sign that the image has been modified : one part has been compressed more times than another part , so the part with fewer compressions ca n\'t have been there in the first place . Experience - science - Sometimes you can apply a scientific technique based on experience . For example if you know the camera that made an image , you may know that the camera has a "" signature "" , eg an unusual colour balance . Some camera phones , for example , have an unusually blue hue to photos . If the photo was taken by that phone , but has a different hue to others in the series , it may have had the colour adjusted . This is where we start to get into experience , rather than straight up analysis . There may well be other techniques I \'m not aware of , but those will catch a lot of edits . Kinda - science - Then there are simpler checks : some image editing programs will add information to the file to state that it was saved by that program , or the date may change : eg if you send me a series of 6 photos from the same place , and all of them have a "" last modified "" date that fits , but one is a few days / weeks later , that \'s a fairly clear sign the file has been changed ... a clever editor will usually change these , but you may forget or miss one . Experience - And then we have the truly "" experience "" stuff , where it comes down to knowing what to look for and finding clues or evidence . For example on that plane photo , it was originally caught out because people looked closely and caught the telltale "" rectangle "" shape around the aircraft that shows it was copied in and then attempted to blur the two images together . In other photos , they may look for things like missing fingers or limbs ( surprisingly common , [ example ] ( URL_0 ) ) in photos of people , or for straight lines "" bending "" , eg if someone has tried to adjust a person \'s figure to make them look thinner / fatter , sometimes they will accidentally move a nearby doorframe or stripy carpet . [ Example ] ( URL_1 ) Other things to look for are "" perfect "" hair or where someone has over - done the photoshop , making things a little too good to be true . Hair is always a good one to look at , as it \'s very difficult to edit perfectly , and you can sometimes find strands that are a different colour where they were missed . Reflections are always a great one for this : [ Example ] ( URL_3 ) With hair particularly , but also generally , you can look at the areas between colours and see if the editor accidentally slipped over onto the "" next "" area when modifying them .', 'You have to carefully examine the image . In digital photography , there may be pixelation or other clear signs of modification . Inconsistent focus or lighting are big clues -- shadows should properly cast themselves on all subjects in the picture , for example , and objects at the same distance from the viewer should normally be in the same focus .', 'Hi dctrhu , You asked two questions : 1 . Is there science to it ? Absolutely . 2 . Is it like a crime scene where you just have to infer something from certain clues and cues ? Definitely . ( Full disclosure : Doing digital photo analysis is a big part of my daily job . And I created the URL_1 web site as a means to get other people interested in this field . ) The scientific method is based on logical reasoning . There are two main types of logical reasoning : deductive and inductive . ( There are others , but these are the two main ones that people typically discuss . ) Deductive reasoning is based on causality . "" A "" leads to "" B "" leads to "" C "" . For example : Neal is typing on his computer . Neal \'s computer is in his office . Therefore , Neal is in his office . Deductive reasoning is objective ( it does n\'t matter what you think ; these are the facts ) . In contrast , inductive reasoning is subjective and based on experience . This is often used for predicting , forecasting , and behavioral analysis -- situations with inherent uncertainty . ( "" Did someone alter this picture ? "" or "" did a camera generate this ? "" evaluate behaviors with inherent uncertainty . ) To quote a paragraph from URL_0 : > Inductive reasoning is the opposite of deductive reasoning . Inductive reasoning makes broad generalizations from specific observations . "" In inductive inference , we go from the specific to the general . We make many observations , discern a pattern , make a generalization , and infer an explanation or a theory , "" Wassertheil - Smoller told Live Science . "" In science there is a constant interplay between inductive inference ( based on observations ) and deductive inference ( based on theory ) , until we get closer and closer to the \' truth , \' which we can only approach but not ascertain with complete certainty . "" As an example , if you have ever broken a bone then you likely had an X - ray . The X - ray permits an analyst to view details that would otherwise go unseen . The X - ray is objective , not subjective . The X - ray system is based on deductive reasoning . ( We shoot X - rays into an arm and the bone absorbs / reflects differently than the soft tissues . This permits visualizing the bone without cutting open the arm . ) However , the X - ray image does not draw any conclusions about the subject matter . When the X - ray technician says , "" I can not tell you that it is broken because a diagnosis requires a doctor "" , then you enter the realm of the subjective . ( This is why you can ask for a "" second opinion "" -- opinions are subjective . ) Diagnosis are based on inductive reasoning . Continuing the example : arm hurts , X - ray shows a break in the bone , so the diagnosis is a broken arm . This conclusion is based on experience : I \'ve never seen a broken arm without a break visible in the X - ray , and I \'ve never seen an unbroken arm with a break in the X - ray , so it is very likely a broken arm . Most photo analysis methods act like an X - ray , permitting the visualization of otherwise - unseen attributes . The interpretation of the results requires a human to make a subjective determination based on specific factors ( inductive reasoning ) . In the case of digital photo forensics , it is usually difficult to prove that a picture is real or untampered . However , there are some telltale signs that can indicate alteration . These indicators can be used for deductive reasoning . ( E.g. , If it \'s supposed to be directly from a Nikon camera and it \'s missing Nikon metadata , then it is n\'t directly from a Nikon camera . ) We can also use these artifacts with inductive reasoning . For example , if the picture is supposed to be unaltered and one section has a significantly different noise signature and compression ratio and coloring than the rest of the picture , then it was likely altered . The word "" likely "" is predictive and requires inductive reasoning . Depending on the algorithm , we can even identify a confidence interval for the accuracy ( likeliness ) of the conclusion . For example : "" I compared the noise signature to that of 1,000 camera original pictures covering 200 different similar camera models . None of the camera originals had noise patterns that varied by region . So my confidence is in excess of 99 % accuracy . "" -- after showing that 1,000 pictures from 200 cameras is a good - enough sample size . Conclusively proving that a picture is real / unaltered can be difficult . ( E.g. , "" I saw him take the picture with the camera and this picture came straight from the camera . "" ) However , using inductive and deductive reasoning , we can rule out options . For example , if Adobe always leaves telltale artifacts and none are present , then we can rule out Adobe . Gimp leaves other artifacts , so we can rule that out . If we can rule out all of the common alteration methods , then we can conclude that it is likely real / unaltered . More often , we conclude with something like "" based on the tests performed , there is no indication of tampering or alteration "" . This does n\'t mean it is real ; it only means we did n\'t detect anything wrong . And if we have no reason to suspect sophisticated tampering outside of the scope of the tests performed , then we can induce that it is likely real / unaltered .']",0
How do explosions kill people ? I guess it makes sense when you 're standing in extremely close proximity to the actual explosion .

Explain like I'm five.,"['First , the whole "" getting thrown into the air "" thing is just a Hollywood stunt effect . You \'re not actually going to be lifted off your feet more than a couple of inches unless the explosion is underneath you . The primary way an explosion will kill you is the shockwave . A wall of compressed air comes racing away from the explosion at high speed . When this shock wave hits your body it \'s going to damage your internal organs . Secondarily , you can be hit with shrapnel and debris . For example , grenades do n\'t generally kill with the explosion itself . The metal shards around the explosive fly off in all directions and will kill you that way .', ""When a bomb goes off , the small mass of explosives expands rapidly as it is turned into a gas . It 's the same thing that happens in a campfire when a small log turns into a huge amount of smoke and other gases . However , the stuff that bombs are made of is specially designed to turn into gas in the blink of an eye . When this expansion happens it pushes all the air that was around the bomb before it went off out of the way . This creates wind that moves extremely fast , often times faster than the speed of sound . This superfast moving air tries to push the air in front of it out of the way , but that air ca n't move out of the way fast enough so it piles up into much thicker , high pressure air . Imagine a snowplow driving down the street , but instead of the snow getting thrown out of the way , it keeps piling up on the front of the plow and gets heavier and more tightly compacted . This air is moving so fast , and is so tightly compacted , that when it hits a person , it 's like getting hit by a solid object . It can either rip them apart , or shake them so violently that there insides turn to mush . To better understand this , think about what it feels like when you stick your hand out of a car window . That air is moving at only 60 mph , and it still pushes your arm backwards with a good amount of force , and causes your skin to ripple and jiggle . Now imagine if you were in a fighter jet that was going as fast as it can and you stuck your hand out the cockpit ."", ""In one of four ways : 1 . The force of the blast 2 .

"How do eyes focus ? When your eyes focus in on something what is happening ? Also , why ca n't you just focus on everything at once ? Explain like I'm five.","[""I 'm * * NOT * * an expert but I 'll give this a go . There are a few parts of your eye that are required to focus an image ; it 's similar to a camera . --Cameras have : 1 ) An adjustable lens that can be used to zoom in or out by moving individual lenses closer together or farther apart . 2 ) It has an aperture or shutter ; something that controls the amount of light exposure . 3 ) It has film or a pixel array ( for digital cameras ) that collects the light taken in from the lens and aperture . --The analogous parts of your eye are : 1 ) The lens which can be flexed back and forth by ciliary muscles ; these are the things that trigger pain when you try to focus on an object very close to your eye . The lens and ciliary muscles are the primary tools used by your eye to focus the light onto your retina ( the film ) . When the ciliary muscles contract or relax , they change the angle at which light hits the lens , allowing it to be focused . This depends on the distance , size of the object and angle of incoming light . Also the intraocular fluid ( the liquid that fills your eye balls and abbreviated IO ) is responsible for additional bending of the light because the refractive index between the lens and IO fluid changes . The most important change of refraction index is between the air and your lens because the change is substanitally greater ( allows the light to bend more ) . 2 ) Your iris is the aperture that controls the amount of light that is processed by your retina ; too much light and you get an over - stimulated retina ( similar to a white - washed photo ) . Too little light there 's not enough light to create an image ( darkness ) . But this bit is n't really very important for a focused image , but it is extremely important for getting a usable image . 3 ) The third component of your eye is your retina that catches the raw data of the image and sends it out to be processed . Without the light being focused very finely onto your retina , you will lose the focus of the image because the light from the object is still in pieces ; they have n't come together to form the image . People with near or far - sightedness have more or less elliptical eyeballs that cause the image to form in front of or behind the retina not * * ON * * the retina . Your ciliary muscles and lens may be able to correct for this a little bit it only goes so far . * * TL;DR :* * Your eye uses ciliary muscles , its lens , iris and retinal position to properly deliver a focused image to your brain . To attempt an answer your second question : The reason why you can not focus on everything is because you do n't have multiple eyes . Your eye can only adjust a very small amount of light that enters your eye onto your retina .

So to answer your question , the more light you let in by way of your iris contacting the more exposed your retina is to light . The image , which is composed of light , gets focused your retina . Tl;dr : everything you see is light , the color part of your eye decides how much light to let in . The back of your eye ball sends focused image to your brain ."", 'The focus you are asking about has everything to do with your lens , which sits behind the iris / pupil . When you focus , you flexing and unflexing the lens in your eye . Objects far away require a flatter lens ; because the objects are smaller .

Please explain like I'm five.","[""Fecal transplants, also known as stool transplants or fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), are a medical treatment that involves taking healthy bacteria from the stool of a donor and transferring it to the intestine of a person who is experiencing a bacterial imbalance. The purpose of the fecal transplant is to restore the balance of good and bad bacteria in the recipient's intestine. This can help improve symptoms caused by certain medical conditions, such as certain types of diarrhea and inflammatory bowel disease. To perform a fecal transplant, a healthcare provider will first collect a small amount of healthy stool from a donor. The donor is typically someone who is in good health and who has no history of infections or other health issues that could be transmitted through the stool. The provider will then process the stool to make it safe for transplantation. Next, the provider will insert the processed stool into the recipient's intestine. This can be done in a few different ways, such as through a tube that is inserted through the nose and down into the stomach, or through a small tube that is inserted into the rectum. After the transplant, the healthy bacteria from the donor's stool will help restore the balance of bacteria in the recipient's intestine. This can help improve symptoms and overall health.

Here\'s an example of how it might work: Imagine that there are two jets flying in the sky. Jet A wants to lock onto Jet B. Jet A turns on its radar and starts scanning the sky to find Jet B. When Jet A\'s radar finds Jet B, it sends a signal back to Jet A telling it where Jet B is. Jet A can then use this information to follow Jet B and stay close to it. Meanwhile, Jet B has its own radar turned on and is also looking for other jets in the sky. When Jet B\'s radar detects the radar of Jet A, it knows that Jet A is nearby and may be trying to lock onto it. Jet B can then take evasive action, such as changing direction or altitude, to try to break the lock and escape.

In this case, the filmmakers decided to continue with the production and use a combination of special effects and other actors to finish Ledger's remaining scenes.

This means that the audio and the video will be slightly out of sync, with the audio running slightly ahead of the video.\\n\\nTo fix this, the movie's audio track can be sped up slightly, so that it matches the faster frame rate of the video. This will cause the audio to sound slightly higher pitched, but it will still be in sync with the video. Alternatively, the video can be slowed down slightly, so that it matches the audio. This will cause the video to appear slightly slower, but the audio and video will be in sync.\\n\\nOverall, the process of keeping the audio and video in sync when playing a movie at a higher frame rate involves making slight adjustments to either the audio or the video, so that they both match the desired frame rate.""]",1

How do financial services aimed at women differ from conventional services?,"[""Financial services aimed at women may differ from conventional financial services in a number of ways, including the products and services offered, the marketing and branding, and the overall approach to financial planning and management.One of the key differences is that financial services targeted at women may be designed specifically to meet the financial needs and goals of women, who often face unique financial challenges and priorities due to factors such as the gender pay gap, the disproportionate burden of caregiving responsibilities, and longer lifespans. These services may be marketed as more inclusive and empowering, and may aim to address issues such as financial literacy and empowerment, as well as provide support for women-owned businesses.Some examples of financial services aimed at women include:Investment and savings products that are specifically designed for women and their financial goals, such as retirement planning, saving for education, and wealth building.Financial planning and advisory services that are tailored to the needs and priorities of women, such as help with budgeting, debt management, and estate planning.Educational resources and workshops that focus on financial literacy and empowerment for women, such as information on saving and investing, building credit, and starting a business.Networking and mentorship opportunities for women entrepreneurs and business owners, including access to funding and support for growing and scaling a business.It's worth noting that while these types of financial services can be beneficial for women, they are not necessarily exclusive to women and may also be useful for men.

The efficacy of criminal profiling is hotly debated . It does n't help that shows misrepresent what it is and how well is works ."", ""In certain situations , it may be possible to infer some psychological traits or characteristics of the criminal through profiling with a reasonable degree of accuracy based on factors such as who the targeted victim(s ) were , where the crime took place , what evidence was left at the crime scene , whether the crime scene was left neat / clean or messy / dirty , etc . The degree to which these profiles are accurate tends to increase with the number of data - points ( e.g. crime scenes ) that the profiler has to work with ( i.e. that are believed to be linked to the same offender ) . Profiling specific details ( e.g. a particular car model ) can not be done with any sort of accuracy unless the profiler has additional information ( e.g. physical evidence or eye - witness accounts ) which leads him / her to make such a conclusion . It is possible , however , that certain evidence may lead the profiler to suspect the criminal drives a certain type of vehicle . For example , evidence may suggest that the crime was politically motivated and the offender is an environmental protection activist . It may therefore be predicted that the offender drives an environmentally friendly electric / hybrid car . If , on the other hand , the criminal is suspected of being a hunter and weapons enthusiast , it may be predicted that he drives a utility truck of some sort which has lots of storage space . Criminal Profiling is still a hotly debated topic in Forensic Psychology because - although many profiles do turn out to be quite accurate - there are many criminals who are eventually caught and do n't end - up matching the predicted profile . The forensic utility of profiling is still questioned and it 's important for people to realize that these profiles are merely educated guesses and law enforcement should not eliminate or ignore suspects who do n't fit the suspected profile . Source : Degree in Psychology & Criminology ."", 'Most of the traditional "" real - life "" FBI profiles are more demographic - based than psychology - based . That is , they figured out that most rapists and other predatory sexual criminals started at around X age , grew more criminally sophisticated ( and often more violent ) as they committed more crimes , had certain types of experiences and behaviors in their background ( abuse , neglect , voyeuristic behavior , violence toward animals ) , etc . Based on that data they \'re able to predict certain things about an offender with a certain degree of accuracy : age ( or at least experience level ) , race -- since most sexual criminals tend to victimize those of their own race -- background / living situation , and so on . In addition , there are certain other things that are more specific . For instance , if a murder is carried out "" military style "" , then they might surmise that the killer has military or law enforcement experience . If the crime scene is haphazard or disorganized , they may surmise that the killer is less experienced and probably younger , while a "" neater "" crime scene indicates someone who \'s been at it for a while . The real misconception about profiling in terms of how it \'s portrayed in popular culture , I think , is that it \'s often shown as a more intuitive process , which only certain hyper - imaginative / hyper - empathetic individuals are able to carry out . This is where characters like Will Graham from the show "" Hannibal "" or Frank Black from "" Millennium "" come in , who are portrayed as having an almost quasi-(if not explicitly)psychic ability to "" see through the killer \'s eyes "" or what have you .']",0

Please explain like I'm five.","[""Forensic psychologists use a variety of techniques to create criminal profiles, but they do not typically include very specific details like the make, model, and color of a suspect's car or their hobbies. Instead, they focus on analyzing the characteristics of the crime and the behavior of the perpetrator to create a profile of the person who is most likely to have committed the crime. \nTo create a criminal profile, forensic psychologists may consider factors such as the type of crime that was committed, the age and gender of the victim, and any other details about the crime scene that may be relevant. They may also review police reports and interviews with witnesses to gather additional information about the crime. \nOnce they have gathered this information, forensic psychologists use their training in psychology and criminal behavior to make educated guesses about the characteristics of the person who committed the crime. For example, they may consider whether the crime was committed in a very organized or a very disorganized manner, which can provide clues about the personality and level of intelligence of the perpetrator. \nOverall, the goal of creating a criminal profile is to help law enforcement narrow down their list of suspects and ultimately identify and catch the person who committed the crime.""]",1

How do fridges work ? How can energy be used to make something colder than it 's surroundings ? It 's been bothering me for a solid five minutes . Explain like I'm five.,"['Fridges work by using a cooling system to make the inside of the fridge colder than the outside air. Inside the fridge, there is a gas called a refrigerant that flows through a system of tubes. When the refrigerant is pumped through the tubes, it absorbs heat from the air inside the fridge. This process cools down the air inside the fridge. The refrigerant then travels to a compressor, which is a kind of pump. The compressor squeezes the refrigerant, which makes it hot. The hot refrigerant is then sent to a set of coils on the back of the fridge. These coils are called the condenser coils. When the hot refrigerant passes through the condenser coils, it releases the heat it absorbed from inside the fridge into the air outside the fridge. This process cools down the refrigerant, so it can be pumped back into the fridge to absorb more heat and keep the inside of the fridge cold. So, in short, the fridge uses energy (usually from electricity) to run the compressor and pump the refrigerant through the cooling system. This helps to remove heat from the inside of the fridge and keep it cold.']",1
How do fridges work ? How can energy be used to make something colder than it 's surroundings ? It 's been bothering me for a solid five minutes . Explain like I'm five.,"[""Your intuition is right : you can easily transform energy into heat , but you ca n't transform energy into cold . What you can do , though , is use energy to * * move heat around . * * What a fridge does is take heat from the insulated inside and release it in the back . Your next question may be : how do you take heat from the inside of a fridge when it 's colder than ambient temperature ? Here 's the gist of it : it uses a property of compression . You may have noticed that a bicycle pump gets warm when you use it . It 's not just due to friction , it 's also because compressing air makes it warmer . On the opposite , a spray can gets cold when you use it . That 's because you 're releasing pressure , and that makes it colder . So a fridge use these principles of compression : there 's a fluid that goes through the radiator in the back , then through the insulated inside . When it 's in the radiator , it 's compressed so that it gets hotter and will lose some of its heat to the air around it . Then it goes inside where it is decompressed , which makes it colder and able to take more heat ."", ""Fridges rely on a thermodynamic process known as a [ Heat Pump . ] ( URL_0 ) A quick overview of how they work however : 1 . Electricicty from you wall outlet runs a compressor pump . This compresses the refrigerant fluid , creating a hot fluid at high pressure . - Remember when you compress a fluid , it gets warm . 2 . This hot fluid at high pressure goes through a condensor ( often called the radiator ) on the back of the fridge . This allows the hot fluid to cool down , by losing it 's excess heat to the ambient air . In doing this , the fluid condenses into a liquid . 3 . This high pressure liquid then goes through an expander / throttle valve . This essentially drops the pressure of the fluid : oposite to at point 1 , a decompressing fluid cools down . Because the high pressure fluid was at ambient temperature , the expanding fluid ( past the valve ) will chill below ambient temperature . 4 . The sub - cooled fluid is then passed through an evaporator ( a long coil burried in the body of the fridge ) where it absorbs heat from it 's surroudnings and vaporises the remainder of the refrigerant fluid . Because it draws heat from within the box , the inside of the fridge gets cooler .

If you can spend energy and produce heat to condense a liquid ( the coolant ) outside of the box ( fridge or house ) that you want cold then you can pump it in there and rapidly expand it . If you remember high school physics , the same mass taking up more space will absorb heat and become colder . It 's an endothermic reaction .

"How do frisbees fly ? Google gives a ton of mumbo jumbo . I 'm sorry Google , I did n't know I needed a degree . Please explain like I'm five.","[""Sure! A frisbee flies through the air because of lift, which is a type of force that acts on an object when it moves through the air. Lift is created when the air flows over and under the frisbee's curved surface.

This spin helps to keep the frisbee stable and on course as it flies through the air. The frisbee's curved surface and its shape also help to create lift and keep it stable.So to sum it up, a frisbee flies because of the lift created by its shape, spin, and the way it moves through the air.

That 's basically all there is to it ."", ""Ill keep this simple as I can . basically they are 3 factors . The design are ether a simple disk or doughnut shape that are thrown with a spin . The first is the design of the frisbee are made to ether let it fall slow ( disk ) or to create lift ( doughnut ) . Both are designed to be aerodynamic but each will do slightly diffrent when you spin them . The 2nd is the spin . By spinning you make the frisbee a gyroscope . This stabilizes it into what ever angle you release it at . More spin the longer it 's stabilized and straighter it can travel without falling sideways into the ground or if angled good enough you can make it turn in the air . Some doughnut frisbee act like a fan or helicopter blades and can create lift that makes arching them a lot easier than disk styles . The 3rd is the force from the throw . This is the primary speed , lift , rotation speed , direction and distance the frisbee will travel . Because of so many factors from this one process the math can get confusing if it tries to go into too much detail ."", 'Okay , I just learned about this in jet mechanic school . The front of the Frisbee is splitting the air either above it or below it . The air below exerts air pressure upward , while the air above generates air pressure downward . As it turns out , the upward pressure from the bottom is a little stronger than the downward pressure from the top , so that upward force kinda works against gravity , slowing the frisbee \'s drop . If you want to know why the air on top has such a lower amount of pressure , it \'s explained by Bernoulli \'s principle . Bernoulli studied fluids and pressure or something , and he found out that , while fluids such as air constantly exert pressure outward , movement of the fluid reduces the amount of pressure it can exert . It \'s like it has to redirect the energy required for movement , so it takes it from all the pressure that was sitting around doing nothing . I \'m not great with physics so that \'s about as well as I understand it . Anyway , moving fluids generate less pressure , and the faster they move , the lesser the pressure . So back to frisbees , the top air is moving faster than the bottom air . Why ? Because the shape of the frisbee , kinda curved on top , requires air to move around it , while the bottom air does n\'t have any such obstacle . So the top air loses some of it \'s pressure while moving out of the way of the frisbee \'s "" air foil "" , as we call that shape , and that slight change in pressure causes frisbees to sort of hover in the air like that . This same principle , Bernoulli \'s , explains how air planes fly . That difference in pressure is magnified 1000s of times over by the jet engine pushing it way faster than a frisbee , and eventually that upward pressure becomes stronger than the force of gravity . That \'s the magic of it , thanks for reading .']",0

If a developer notices that Richard Nixon is winning every test game , they might tone down Watergate .', ""> It seems like it would require a lot of math . Does it ? Yes . I 'm writing my doctoral thesis in comp sci on game development and balance is a big part of it . I ca n't tell you specifically what Firaxis does , but to some degree things can be a lot of math , which are well suited to ELI5 because well , the math depends on your combat model and that is game specific . But there are a lot of fairly profound design and philosophical choices . Should a phalanx unit be able to defend against a tank ? With what probability ? Math lets you tweak parameters to make whatever you want happen , but ultimately what the math should do is a design choice . When it comes to more orthogonal choices - like the faction bonuses , where one guy gets bonus money and another guy gets bonus diplomatic relations well , they are n't really balanced in any purely theoretical math sense . It 's not really realistic to try and weight 1 unit of money versus diplo reputation . The idea is to basically run the game a LOT , AI on AI , player on player , AI on player and figure out the probabilities of winning and losing . In a game like Civ where a lot of the game is AI factions against AI factions you can do a lot of balance by just automating the game and seeing how it goes , and keep going until a large enough sample sets gives you close to equal probabilities for each faction . Enter into the discussion : Starcraft . Starcraft is an esport rather than just a single player game . In this case your tolerances on advantages to a given faction are much lower than they are for something like Civ ( or the other extreme , Skyrim , where you can kill the last boss with about 3 hits if you are so inclined ) . Balance really works in multiple layers - units against units , collections of units from an era against other collections from an era ( say early game / late game , or ' ages ' in Civ ) , overall strategies that may encompass multiple eras against each other , and then all of the indirect ( non military ) systems balances against each other . Oh , and in Civ thinks are heavily biased by starting location and conditions , this is deliberate - in SC you 're trying to give everyone an equal chance , in a historical game you 're trying to give a realistic starting condition . In civ the randomness is part of what makes the fun of the game , and optimizing around random conditions , so each game is different . Edit : One thing to add . Sometimes good balance is about thinking outside the immediate set of equations around your combat and say ' lets add reload delay to this weapon , shrink the clip size , or to change how the scope works ' or the like and you get away from bullet damage and rates of fire as big overarching math concepts and change how players can actually use the tools given to them ."", ""It can vary a lot depending on the type of game but usually problems in balance are identified through extensive playtesting and/or collecting and analysing statistics , etc .

Please explain like I'm five.,"['Modifying a video game, also known as ""modding,"" is the process of changing or adding to the original content of a game. This can include things like new characters, levels, gameplay mechanics, or graphics. There are a few different ways that people can mod video games: 1. Using modding tools: Some games come with modding tools built-in, or they can be downloaded from the internet. These tools allow users to alter the game\'s code or assets (graphics, sounds, etc.) in order to create new content. 2. Editing game files: Some games store their content in plain text or other easily editable file formats. By editing these files, it\'s possible to change the game in various ways. 3. Reverse engineering: Some people who want to mod a game will try to figure out how the game works by looking at its code or by playing around with the game files. This can be a more complicated process, but it can also give modders a lot of flexibility in what they can change. Overall, modding a video game requires some technical knowledge and a willingness to experiment and troubleshoot. However, there are also many modding communities online where people share their creations and help each other out.']",1

One way to do this is to use a ""clock"" or ""timer"" function built into the programming language that the game is written in. This function is able to measure time in small increments, such as milliseconds or even microseconds (1/1,000th of a millisecond).\\n\\nTo record the time it takes for a player to complete a race in a game like Mario Kart, the game can use this timer function to start a clock when the race begins and stop the clock when the player crosses the finish line.

Geosynchronous orbits are a type of orbit where a satellite orbits the Earth at the same speed that the Earth is turning. This means that the satellite stays in the same position above the Earth\'s surface at all times.\r\n\r\nTo understand how this works, it\'s helpful to think about how the Earth\'s gravity works. Gravity is what keeps objects stuck to the Earth\'s surface and what makes things fall down. The Earth\'s gravity also reaches out into space, and it pulls on satellites and other objects that are orbiting the Earth.\r\n\r\nIf a satellite is orbiting the Earth and it\'s moving too slowly, then the Earth\'s gravity will pull it down and it will fall back to the surface. But if the satellite is moving fast enough, it will be able to stay in orbit and keep going around and around the Earth. The speed that a satellite needs to go in order to stay in orbit is called the ""escape velocity.""\r\n\r\nFor a satellite to be in a geosynchronous orbit, it needs to be in a very specific spot in space and it needs to be moving at a very specific speed. If it\'s not in the right spot or moving at the right speed, then it won\'t be able to stay in a geosynchronous orbit and it will either fall back to the Earth or fly off into space.']",1

The result is that it follows a curved path that keeps it at the same height , as the two forces cancel !

Similarly, a satellite in a geosynchronous orbit stays in the same place above the Earth because it is moving at the same speed as the Earth's rotation. Even though the satellite is not falling towards the Earth, it is still being pulled towards the Earth by the Earth's gravity. This is what keeps the satellite in orbit around the Earth.

If you put the long edge right at eye level , then look at an object above or below your eye level , you 'll notice that the string will hang and align with a number . That number is a measure of the angle from level of the object you 're looking at .

Nutrients include carbohydrates , fats , proteins ( or their building blocks , amino acids ) , and vitamins .

Conversely , "" a nutrient is said to be "" essential "" if it must be obtained from an external source , either because the organism can not synthesize it or produces insufficient quantities "" . So there are two kinds of nutrients , those that we can make through our own cellular processes , and those we must obtain through our diet . [ Proteins ] ( URL_2 ) are made up of different [ amnio acids ] ( URL_3 ) . A good analogy is that a protein is like a train , and the individual cars are amnio - acids . Different combinations of railcars , in different orders give different kinds of trains . In the same way , different amnio - acids , in different combinations give different kinds of proteins . Digestion , be it in animals or humans , results in the breakdown proteins into their amnio acid components . The intestine absorbs the individual amnio acids and the body ships these amnio acids to the cells . Cellular processes rearrange the amnio acids in new ways to make new proteins that are used by the animal or human for various bodily functions . So think of the cell as the railyard where new trains ( proteins ) are made but reassembling the cars ( amnio - acids ) into new and different combinations . "" Proteins perform a vast array of functions within living organisms , including catalyzing metabolic reactions , replicating DNA , responding to stimuli , and transporting molecules from one location to another . "" There are [ nine essential amino acids ] ( URL_1 ) that humans must consume in their diet because our cells can not make them through cellular processes . The rest we can make ourselves in our cells . This means that our diet must meet these minimum essential amnio acids requirements in order for us to survive . We can not make the nine , we must consume the nine . The nine are found in all kinds of foods , from plants to meat which is why humans can have such a wide variety of diets ( e.g. vegetarian , vegan , allergen - accomidating ) and still function normally . However , other animals have different essential nutritional requirements . For example , [ cats , unlike humans , can not synthesize the amino acid taurine so it must be added to their diet ] ( URL_0 ) . Some species are able to synthesize Vitamin C and do not need to consume it in their diet ( e.g. mice ) , whereas humans can not synthesize Vitamin C and thus are required to consume it in our diet . These differences in essential nutrient intake creates different dietary requirements for different species and results in different types of foods being consumed preferentially by different species . This is why a horse is able to survive and thrive just on plant material , whereas we are required to consume a more varied diet . They obtain all their unique essential nutrients from their herbivore diet . So other species have different combinations of essential nutrients in order to sustain a balanced and healthy diet . This makes perfect sense , if all species had the exact same requirements there would be a lot of competition for the same food resources . By diversifying what is essential to consume , there is less competition . Remember that it is costly for the body to produce its own nutrients through cellular processes . It is much easier to just consume an amnio acid than produce it . Thus , if a particular amino acid or nutrient is abundant and easily available in a species environment it makes more sense for natural selection to select against the cell \'s producing that nutrient , and for the individual to simply consume it . For example , most primates - including humans - do not synthesize vitamin C. This makes perfect sense since vitamin C is easily acquired through our collective diets by consuming fruit . Fruit is abundant resource in most primate \'s environments thus vitamin C would not be hard to acquire . So each species is balancing what they need to eat , and what they can produce themselves , along with what is available to them in their environment .', ""Herbivores have multiple stomachs with different enzymes that allow them to extract nutrition from fiber .

How do historically low interest rates affect real estate prices?,"[""Interest rates do generally affect house prices but other factors do too, especially the unemployment rate. However, everything else being equal, when interest rates drop, it makes the borrowing of money cheaper so tends to stimulate the economy and the housing market, increasing the demand for houses and generally causes house prices to increase (especially if the supply of new housing doesn't increase with the demand). When interest rates go up the opposite happens. Usually interest rates go down in order to stimulate  a slowing economy and interest rates go up to slow down an overheated economy. Regarding your situation you are able to get a 30 year fixed rate at today’s interest rates (in Australia the longest fixed rate you can get is for 10 years and the rate is usually 1 or 2 percent higher than the standard variable rate. Most people here go for the variable rate or a fixed rate of between 1 to 3 years). This means that even if rates do go up in the future you won't be paying a higher rate, which is a positive for you. You are buying the house to live in so as long as you can keep making the repayments you should not be too worried if the price of the house drops sometime in the future, because if your house has dropped and you want to sell to buy another house to live in, then that house would have also dropped relative to yours (give or take). So your main worry is that rates will go up causing both house prices to fall and unemployment to rise, and you yourself losing your job and eventually your house. It is a risk, but what you need to consider is if you can manage that risk. Firstly, I believe rates won't be going up in the US for a number of years, and if and when they do start going up they will most probably start going up slowly. So you have some time on your side. Secondly, what can you do between now and when interest rates do start going up in a few years: Try to put more saving away to increase your safety net from 6 months to 12 months or more, or make extra repayments into your home loan so that you are ahead if things do go wrong. If you are worried that you could lose your job, what can you do to reduce your chances of losing your job or increasing your chances of getting a new job quickly if you do lose it? Improve your current skills, get new skills, become an invaluable employee, or look at possible opportunities to start your own business. Do your own research on the types of houses you are looking at buying, the more houses you look at the better prepared you will be when the right house at the right price comes along, and the less chance that you will be rushed into buying what might be an overpriced house. So to sum it up; do as much research as you can, have an understanding of what your risks are and how you are going to manage those risks.""]",0

This increased demand can put upward pressure on real estate prices, especially in areas where there is a limited supply of available properties.On the other hand, low interest rates can also make it more attractive for people to invest in real estate, since the cost of borrowing money to purchase property is lower. This can lead to an increase in the number of people looking to buy real estate, which can also put upward pressure on prices.It's worth noting that the relationship between interest rates and real estate prices is not always straightforward, and other factors such as economic conditions, supply and demand dynamics, and local market conditions can also influence real estate prices.""]",1

Please explain like I'm five.","['Holocaust denial is the act of denying the genocide of Jews during World War II, also known as the Holocaust. This belief is not based in fact, but rather is an attempt to downplay or completely ignore the overwhelming evidence that the Holocaust occurred. \nHolocaust deniers may use a variety of tactics to try to justify their beliefs. For example, they may claim that the Holocaust did not happen, or that it was not as widespread or as severe as it is generally believed to be. They may also claim that the victims of the Holocaust were not predominantly Jews, or that the deaths of the victims were not intentional. \nThere is no legitimate evidence to support the arguments of Holocaust deniers. The vast majority of historians and scholars, as well as the survivors of the Holocaust, agree that the Holocaust was a horrific event in which millions of Jews and other minority groups were systematically murdered by the Nazi regime. \nIt is important to remember that the Holocaust was a real and tragic event in history, and denying it only serves to diminish the suffering of the victims and their families.']",1

It \'s plainly obvious that almost nobody commenting has actually looked at what "" Holocaust deniers "" actually claim . I \'m not a "" holocaust denier "" , but If nobody else is going to seriously answer OP \'s question , I will try . To understand why people "" deny the holocaust "" , you have to actually look at their arguments and evidence rather than instantly dismissing them as crazy or stupid as most of the comments here would have you believe . The term "" Holocaust deniers "" is also a very misleading term , as the vast majority of these people do not actually deny that the holocaust happened - in the sense that they do not deny that Jews were put in camps , and that many died . Rather , they instead dispute the circumstances and details of this incredibly politicized historical event and come to a different interpretation . From what I understand , Holocaust revisionists generally deny that the Nazi Concentration camps were designed to systematically exterminate people , and claim the "" death camps "" were actually initially designed as political internment camps , similar to [ camps in the USA for Japanese citizens in WW2 ] ( URL_0 ) . They often mention the Auschwitz swimming pool , Orchestra , theater , sports - field and art activities and ask why they were built for , and used by people who the Nazi \'s intended to simply exterminate . They reference eyewitness quotes and testimony to support their claims(For example , from [ videos like this ] ( URL_1 ) ) . Revisionists also point to the design of the camps , using the blueprints as being clearly ( in their opinion ) , inefficient for mass murder . They claim that the "" gas chambers "" were used for delousing clothing and bedding and go into great detail on that subject . They also explain away much of the holocaust evidence as having been faked after the fact , [ for example this fake photo ] ( URL_2 ) , which has been in newspapers , magazines , documentaries , and even hit front - page on Reddit several times . ( I did some research , in this specific case it turns out the photo really was faked and even mainstream historians admit it . ) When asked to explain why so many died in the camps , they often talk about the mass bombing of farms , railways and roads by allied forces nearing the end of the war - meaning that almost no supplies reached the German people , let alone the camps - resulting in many camp inhabitants dying of starvation and disease . WW2 is an incredibly complex topic , made even more difficult to analyze because of the propaganda used by both sides at the time . Again - To understand why people question the holocaust , you have to actually ask those people ( or watch their videos on Youtube ) .

","['In a hotel with central heating and cooling (HVAC), each room typically has its own thermostat that allows the guests to adjust the temperature to their liking.

The central HVAC system is designed to be able to control the temperature in each room independently, so that guests in one room can set their thermostat to a different temperature than guests in another room. This is done by using a series of ducts and vents that are connected to the central HVAC system and run throughout the hotel, allowing the system to deliver hot or cold air to the various rooms as needed.

One caveat is that ice absorbs a lot of heat to melt , so it works better than , say , a chilled cube of metal , which would warm up fast without cooling the drink much .', 'Temperature is VERY roughly a measurement of how fast particles are moving . So the molecules in the ice are moving slower than the particles in the liquid water . When the faster moving liquid particles collide with the slower moving ice particles , the liquid particles slow down due to a transfer of energy and therefore their temperature drops . The ice particles speed up because of this collision . The temperatures of the two substances will continue to change until they are at the same temperature . Imagine walking through a crowded hallway . You are walking fast and run into someone in front of you who is walking slow . Upon colliding with them , they will speed up and you will slow down .

( Lets call them the hot dancers ) The other group we sapped the energy out of by telling them they are bad dancers and they should be embarrassed and do n't make a fool out of themselves . ( Lets call them the cold dancers ) So when both groups get out on the dance floor the hot dancers start flying around the dance floor at such a pace they barely cling on to each other , they bounce off each other with a lot of energy . The cold dancers need emotional support so they cling to each other in the center in a big group and kind of just chill while doing a little bit of dancing , but they do nt have enough energy to separate . Occasionally though the hot dancers run into the cluster of cold dancers and knock one or 2 of the cold dancers out of the block , the cold dancers get a little confidence or energy out of this and start to dance a little faster , but they cling on to some of the hot dancers , effectively slowing down the hot dancers , but speeding up the cold dancers . After a while enough hot dancers have collided with cold dancers , that we no longer have hot or cold dancers , just the entire dance floor filled with warm dancers . The energy of the dance floor has reached an equilibrium . So now that the analogy is out of the way . Temperature is a measure of kinetic and internal energy of molecules , molecules with higher energy ( moving around faster ) transfer that energy mainly by colliding with other molecules and passing that energy on to the less energetic molecules , while losing whatever energy they passed on , until everything is the same energy .

When you put an ice cube in a drink, the ice absorbs heat from the drink.

How do you trade with countries with different currencies ? Explain like I'm five. ,"['It is both government and business trading . In some countries there is no difference between the two . At the macro level it ’s not hard . Goods made in one country get sold in another country . Once you start digging into specifics it gets more complicated . Global trade usually benefits both countries economically and politically . But problems can also arise . For example , the cost of labor in places like China and India is much lower than in the US . Therefore , a product manufactured in India will be much cheaper than if it were manufactured in America . The workers overseas benefit because they get to have jobs , and American consumers benefit because we get cheaper products . So who gets left out ? American workers . This is why people get angry about trade imbalance and overseas manufacturing . An industry might move production overseas and so that means those jobs are n’t available for American workers . America ’s job market is shifting to focus on tech jobs and services rather than manufacturing products , and people who would normally have those manufacturing jobs feel left behind and forgotten . And it ’s not just manufacturing , either , although that is the easiest example . Countries normally attempt to control this phenomenon by imposing taxes called tariffs . If China is out - competing Americans in a certain industry , the government might impose taxes on Chinese products . This is intended to drive up the price on those products and make them less competitive . It ’s a complicated and dangerous game , because trade works both ways . If we impose a tax on Chinese products , China will look for something we export or something we need , and put a tax on that in retaliation . Taxes intended to hurt competitors and help Americans could very easily backfire by driving up prices and hurting American consumers . As for the currency problem , that ’s not a huge deal . People generally agree on the value of a product , so by looking at a price of that product in different countries they can establish a rough equivalency between currencies . So for example , 1 € is about $ 1.20 . There are banks and traders that will convert one currency to another . But little actual currency changes hands . Most of it is done with ledgers and credit rather than hard cash . But there ’s a catch . A currency ’s value is also decided by those traders and speculators . Certain currencies might be more useful or more stable . The US dollar , for example , is globally accepted and considered extremely stable , so people are confident in it . But if a country has economic problems ( like Venezuela for example ) then people lose confidence in that currency . They say , “ I ca n’t trust this money to hold its value , so you need to pay me a premium to accept some risk . ” Or maybe they just stop accepting it altogether . The relative value of currencies are always fluctuating slightly as traders make these kinds of judgments . If a country has problems and becomes unstable , the value of their currency might plummet as people avoid it and look for more stable alternatives .', ""> Are governments trading with other governments or is it private companies trading with one another ?

"How do insects survive the winter ? Over winter they just disappear , so where do they go ? Please explain like I'm five.","[""Insects have many different ways of surviving the winter, depending on the species and the conditions in their environment. Some insects, like ladybugs and monarch butterflies, migrate to a warmer place for the winter. They fly to a new location where they can find food and shelter until the weather gets warmer again. \nOther insects, like bees and ants, stay in their nests or hives and huddle together to keep warm. They may also store food to eat during the winter when there isn't as much to find outside. \nSome insects, like moths and butterflies, lay their eggs in the fall, and the eggs hatch into larvae or caterpillars in the spring. The larvae then grow into adult insects and emerge when the weather gets warmer. \nOther insects, like ladybugs and praying mantises, go into a state of dormancy during the winter. This means that they stop moving and become very still, almost like they are sleeping. They are able to do this because their bodies are able to slow down their metabolism and use very little energy until the weather gets warm again. \nSo, insects have many different ways of surviving the winter, but they all have to find a way to stay warm, find food, and avoid predators until the weather gets warm again.""]",1

How do insurance companies gain profit ? How do they ? Please explain like I'm five.,"[""Insurance companies make money by selling policies to people and businesses.

So, one way they can make more profit is by being very careful about who they sell policies to - they might only sell policies to people who are very unlikely to need to use them.Another way insurance companies make money is by investing the premium money they collect. They might put it in the stock market, real estate, or other investments to earn more money. That way, even if they have to pay out a lot in claims, they might still make a profit from the investment income.Overall, insurance companies try to balance how much they charge in premiums with how much they have to pay out in claims, and they also try to make extra money through investments, so they can make a profit.""]",1
How do insurance companies make money ? What if they pay out more than they take in ? Explain like I'm five.,"[""The responses so far have focused on underwriting profit ( taking in more premium than they pay out ) . For most property and liability insurance companies , underwriting profit is a very small part of their overall profit . Most insurers write at close to a 100 % combined ratio . This means that , on average , for every dollar of premium they collect , they pay out a dollar of loss and expense . So how do they * really * make money ? Investment income is the far more important piece . Insurers need to have a huge nest - egg of money so that they ’re able to pay claims when they arrive . This nest - egg is called “ surplus ” or “ capital ” . This capital is n’t just sitting there doing nothing though , it ’s being invested the whole time . They also make money on the time lag between when you pay them and when they pay claims . Premium is usually paid in full at the beginning of the policy , but your claim ( if you have one ) wo n’t be for some time after that . That premium is invested in the meantime . A few have responded that the insurers never loses money . This is n't true . Insurers have bad luck years all the time , but that ’s why they have so much capital ( nest - egg ) . They have enough money on hand to handle a bad year every once in a while . They also purchase reinsurance as a contingency for bad underwriting years . * * tl;dr Property and liability insurance companies make most of their money off of investment income NOT charging more than they expect to pay out * *"", ""One important item that has not been discussed is that , in addition to the fact that they are paying out less than they take in in claims , they are investing most of the money they receive as premiums . They invest this money and earn a return on it . Since they are n't borrowing the premium dollars they do n't pay interest , and thus they are a great source of investment capital . The insurance company will not invest all of that money though . They will keep a percentage in liquid accounts or asset to pay claims . This is called a reserve . As others have stated , the insurance companies rely on statistics to make an educated guess at how much money they need in reserve and how much they can invest .

How do knives work ? Why can knives and other sharp things cut things ? Is it because they are narrow at one end ? I do n't understand . Please explain like I 'm five ! Explain like I'm five.,"[""Sure! Knives work by using a sharp edge to cut through things. The sharp edge is usually narrow and pointed, which helps it to easily slice through whatever it is cutting.\n\nWhen you use a knife to cut something, you're applying pressure to the knife. This pressure forces the knife's sharp edge through the material you're cutting. The sharper the edge is, the easier it is to cut through the material.\n\nSo, the narrow, pointed edge of a knife is important because it allows the knife to easily slice through things. But it's not the only factor that determines how well a knife will cut. The material the knife is made of, the shape of the blade, and the strength of the person using the knife can also affect its cutting ability.""]",1

How do knots in your back form ? and how does digging into them with someone 's elbow get rid of them ? I have a killer knot in my back .. hahhaa Explain like I'm five.,"['Knots in your back can form when your muscles become tight and tense. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as stress, poor posture, or overuse. When a muscle becomes tight and tense, it can form a knot, which is a small, hard area within the muscle that feels tender to the touch.\r\n\r\nTo get rid of a knot in your back, you can try massaging it. Massaging a knot can help to loosen the muscle and release the tension that is causing the knot. One way to do this is by using your elbow to dig into the knot. This is called ""elbow grease,"" and it involves using the pressure of your elbow to apply firm, deep pressure to the knot. This pressure can help to release the tension and loosen the muscle, which can help to get rid of the knot.\r\n\r\nIt\'s important to be gentle and go slowly when massaging a knot, especially if it is painful. You can also try using a foam roller or a massage ball to apply pressure to the knot and loosen the muscle. It may take some time and persistence to get rid of a knot, but with regular massaging and stretching, you can help to prevent knots from forming in the first place.']",1

"How do languages such as latin or native tribe languages die out ? I was listening to Lilium , a latin song . It was so beautiful that it made me ask why latin die out ? Explain like I'm five.","['Languages can die out for a variety of reasons. One reason is that the speakers of the language may stop using it and start speaking a different language instead, either because they are forced to by external circumstances or because they choose to do so. For example, Latin, which was once the dominant language in Europe, is no longer spoken as a first language by anyone, although it is still used in some limited contexts, such as in the writing of scientific names in biology. This is because Latin was gradually replaced by other languages, such as French, Spanish, and Italian, as people stopped speaking Latin and started speaking these other languages instead.\r\n\r\nAnother reason that languages can die out is if the people who speak the language are killed or forced to leave their land, or if their culture is suppressed or assimilated into another culture. This can happen as a result of wars, natural disasters, or other types of conflict. For example, many Native American languages have died out because the people who spoke them were forced to leave their land or were killed by European colonizers.\r\n\r\nIn general, languages tend to die out when the people who speak them stop using them and start speaking a different language, or when the culture of the people who speak the language is suppressed or lost.']",1

Explain like I'm five.","[""Why does a language which was once the dominant primary language stop being that way ? The short answer is political , economic , and cultural power . When the Roman Empire ruled the entire Mediterranean basin , using Latin as the language of politics , law , and trade , anyone who wanted to interact with the Roman government or Roman citizens needed to speak Latin . But as the influence of the Empire gradually receded , Latin went with it , being gradually replaced by the languages of the peoples that assumed power in Rome 's place . Latin was maintained as the language of scholarship well into the eighteenth century , but as the introduction of the printing press improved literacy amongst the common people ( who did n't speak Latin ) , the demand for materials in local languages ensured its practical demise by 1900 or so . Even the Vatican is moving away from it . By contrast , native languages are almost never really languages of power . As soon as indigenous peoples come into contact with a dominant imperial / colonial nation , the power imbalance is such that there is incredible pressure on the natives to speak the imperial language and almost no incentive for the imperials to learn the native language . That kind of pressure is why languages die . It 's not just straight imperial avarice though . Languages used for trade and law benefit in terms of their functionality and vocabulary . This is one of the main reasons English is becoming so influential : it 's got a word for almost everything , and if it does n't , it 'll borrow one . So it 's not just that imperial languages are imperial , but you can also use them to say things that you might not have been able to say in a native language ."", 'Latin lives on , but not as a spoken language and not as a native tongue . Latin - in its day - was divided into two forms . "" Classical latin "" and "" Vulgar "" latin .

For instance , a word to say "" you "" is "" 네 "" which sounds like "" neh "" while the word to say "" My "" can be "" 내 "" which sounds like "" Neh "" so to avoid confusion , "" You "" becomes "" 니 "" or "" Nee "" and My is stressed more as "" Nay "" or "" 내 "" Thus when singing "" I love you , "" you sing 니가 사랑해 ( 사랑해 = love ) and no one thinks you love something you own .

Please explain like I'm five.","[""In languages like Chinese that use pitch to distinguish between words with different meanings, singing can sometimes make it more difficult to understand the lyrics of a song. This is because the melody of the song might cause the pitch of the words to change in a way that makes them sound different from how they would be spoken in normal conversation. \nFor example, if a word in Chinese has a high pitch when it is spoken in a normal conversation, it might have a different meaning than the same word with a low pitch. However, if that word is sung as part of a song, the pitch might be different than it would be in normal conversation, which could make it harder to understand the word's meaning. \nOverall, it is important for singers in languages like Chinese to carefully consider the pitches of the words they are singing and try to maintain the correct pitch patterns in order to ensure that the lyrics are understandable to their listeners.""]",1

How do laser thermometers work ? I swear it 's magic Please explain like I'm five.,"[""Laser thermometers work by using a laser to measure the temperature of an object. The laser thermometer sends out a laser beam, which bounces off the object and returns to the thermometer.

It's not magic, but it might seem like it because it can measure the temperature of something without touching it! This can be very useful in situations where you don't want to touch the object, or when it's too hot or cold to touch. Here's an example of how it works: 1.

Here are some tips for practicing safe sex as a lesbian: 1. Use condoms: Condoms can be used on sex toys or fingers to reduce the risk of STI transmission. They can also be used during oral sex to protect against STIs that are transmitted through saliva, such as gonorrhea and HIV. 2. Use dental dams: Dental dams are thin, square pieces of latex or polyurethane that can be placed over the vulva or anus during oral sex to prevent the exchange of bodily fluids. 3. Avoid sharing sex toys: If you do share sex toys, make sure to clean them thoroughly before and after use. You can also use a condom on the toy to reduce the risk of STI transmission. 4. Get tested regularly: It's important to get tested for STIs regularly, even if you're not experiencing any symptoms. This will help you and your partner(s) stay healthy and take steps to protect yourselves and each other. Remember, safe sex is about more than just preventing pregnancy.

They also invest the money that they collect from premiums in a variety of financial products, such as stocks, bonds, and real estate. When the investments earn interest or dividends, the insurance company can use that money to cover its operating expenses and make a profit. Here's an example of how it might work: 1. A person buys a life insurance policy from an insurance company. 2. The person pays a monthly or yearly premium to the insurance company. 3. The insurance company takes the premium money and invests it in stocks, bonds, and other financial products. 4. The investments earn interest or dividends over time. 5. The insurance company uses the money from the investments to pay for its operating expenses, such as employee salaries and office rent. 6. If the money left over after paying expenses is more than the insurance company expected, it can keep the extra money as profit. I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.""]",1
How do loading bars work ? Why do they work so badly ? Please explain like I'm five.,"['Imagine you are in class and your teacher asks you to write all of the capital letters of the alphabet four times - A A A A B B B B C C C C .... You know that you \'ll have to write a little more than 100 letters on the page . You can guess how long it takes you to write a single letter , but writing can sometimes be faster or slower . This is true for computers too . A loading bar in computers is basically the same as the teacher asking you every second , "" JPK , how much time do you still need to finish writing your letters ?

But if it took you 3 seconds for the letter B ( curves ! ) or 1 second for the letter C ( do n\'t need to lift the pencil ! ) then your guesses will be a little bit wrong every time . Now what happens if you drop your pencil ? ( In this analogy , after flushing data to disk , the computer switched tasks to take care of something of higher priority , like opening the reddit home page in your browser ) Suddenly your time changes a little bit more because you have to take time to pick up your pencil ( task switch ) , or to sharpen your pencil ( file seeking ) , or to erase a mistake ( error checking ) , or to write your name on the assignment ( file system journaling ) or to put a page down and get a new page ( storing in cache or page memory ) . It was very easy to guess when you only had to think about how fast you wrote the first letter .... but clearly it is n\'t enough information to figure out the entire time remaining . ---- As far as the last 1 % goes , this is kind of like doing your entire assignment first before you write your name and date and class and give your pages to the teacher . The loading bar usually estimates time remaining based on the task it represents , since it can actually be measured by looking at past progress . That last percent often includes tasks that can not be measured . For example , when you download files , they are usually downloaded to a temp directory first , then moved to the real destination ( or they are downloaded at the real directory but with a fake extension , like myfile.jpg.part ; then the file is renamed to myfile.jpg when the download is complete ) .', 'I came in to expect a huge talk about loading bars used in factories ... not computer stuff ... * I will show myself out *', 'They are not based on time left for the computer to process but how much data is left to process .']",0

"How do locks and keys work hierarchically ?

Please explain like I'm five.","[""Sure! Locks and keys are used to keep people from going into places they're not supposed to go, or to keep things safe. When you use a key to open a lock, it's like you're solving a puzzle. The key is the solution, and the lock is the puzzle.A lock is like a box with a bunch of tiny little wheels inside. Each wheel has a bump on it, and the bumps are all different heights. The key has teeth on it, and each tooth is a different shape. When you put the key into the lock, the teeth on the key fit into the wheels in the lock and lift the bumps up to the right height.When all the bumps are at the right height, the lock can be opened. If the key doesn't have the right teeth, the bumps won't be at the right height, and the lock won't open.Sometimes, there are lots of locks that need to be opened, and it would be really hard to carry around a bunch of different keys. That's when people use a master key. A master key is like a special key that can open lots of different locks, kind of like a puzzle-solving master!Does that make sense?""]",1

In some buildings , locks and keys are designed so that some keys each only open a single lock , some keys open multiple , and there is usually a master key which opens every lock . Please explain like I'm five.","['One way this can work is this : Consider how a pin tumbler lock works . When the key \'s [ particular set of teeth ] ( URL_0 ) cause the pins to line up with the break point in the cylinder , the cylinder is free to rotate and disengage the lock . A multiple key system changes this up by introducing [ "" master wafers , "" ] ( URL_1 ) separate pins , into the lock . This generates another shear line , and exponentially increases the number of keys that can open the lock . If one pin has a master wafer , then there are two possible keys that can open that lock : one that pushes the master wafer above the shear line , and one that leaves it underneath . The more such wafers you put into a lock , the more unique keys you can make that will open the lock . A lock with five pins , each with a master wafer , can have 2 ^ 5 keys that open it . This is the basis of how master and semi - master keys work . Consider an apartment tenant having a key that opens the front door of the complex and his own front door , but not his neighbor \'s . The lock cylinder \'s pins are shaped in such a way that it \'ll line up for the front door and his own door , but not his neighbor \'s .', 'This is n\'t the way locks work but it might help illustrate . Imagine a very simple lock - one where it \'s enough just to get the key into the keyhole to unlock the door - with a keyhole shaped like a letter \' E \' . You have an \' E \' shaped key that will fit that lock perfectly , but it would n\'t fit locks shaped like any other letter of the alphabet . Your boss \'s key might be shaped like an \' F \' . His key will fit his \' F \' locks , but it \'ll actually also fit your \' E \' lock . So his key will work both , but yours will only work one . If someone has an \' L \' shaped key , they can open \' L \' shaped locks - but while it wo n\'t fit \' F \' shaped locks like your boss \'s key , it will fit your \' E \' lock . If someone has a key shaped like an \' l \' , that \'ll fit lots of locks : B , D , E , F , H , I , K etc , much like a master key . This is similar in principle to what happens inside a modern lock , in that there are sets of tumblers or wafers that each may have more than one valid "" unlock "" position . This allows you to have more than one key - shape that works a lock , but also allows you to have different locks that have different keys but share one particular "" master "" keyshape that works with them all .', ""It usually comes down to the use of master pins in the lock to allow master keys to work . These allow multiple keys to work through a specific lock . Say you have a key for an office worker with the cuts 5 - 2 - 3 , the lock would be pinned to 5 - 2 - 3 . Now the boss may need access to that office , and others , but does n't want to carry a massive bunch of keys , so you put in a master system . Boss ' key might be cut 5 - 2 - 6 , so you need to add a 3 master pin to the last one so it works for both a 3 & 6 . Then more locks are installed , padlocks here , roller doors there , common areas , etc . So you may need a big master key system . So office guy has key 1 - gets him in the front door & his office only . The cleaner might have a CMK ( cleaner master key ) which gets them through front door , all offices & common areas but not the sheds out the back or padlocks . Warehouse guy might have key 2 which gets access to front gate , warehouse , sheds , but not the offices . Then the boss wants his key to access * everything * - so he has a GMK ( grand master key ) . Gardener needs access , has key 3 which accesses front gate & maintenance sheds only . Whew , what a headache , all these keys & locks .... So , hierarchically , there are potentially lots of different keys that will work through the same single lock , from the base key through to different levels of master key . So you might have key 1 , cmk , mk1 ( master key 1 for bosses lackey ) , gmk . Warning : no - one uses 3pin locks because they are n't very secure . Filling the chambers with master pins allows * any * key to work , but massively reduces security . There is a lot more to it but if I explain it all it 's no longer eli5 but eli - apprentice .

How do markets “factor in” a future event?,"['Markets ""factor in"" a future event by incorporating expectations about the event into asset prices. This can happen through a variety of channels, such as changes in demand for a particular asset, changes in the supply of an asset, or changes in the risk associated with holding an asset.For example, if investors expect that a company will announce strong earnings in the future, they may be more likely to buy the company\'s stock, which would drive up the price. On the other hand, if investors expect that a company will announce weak earnings, they may be more likely to sell the company\'s stock, which would drive down the price.In general, financial markets are constantly incorporating new information about the future, and this information is reflected in the prices of assets. When a major event occurs, such as a change in interest rates or the release of economic data, it can have a significant impact on asset prices, as investors and traders adjust their expectations about the future in light of the new information.']",1
How do markets “factor in” a future event?,"['At the most fundamental level, every market is comprised of buyers and selling trading securities. These buyers and sellers decide what and how to trade based on the probability of future events, as they see it. That\'s a simple statement, but an example demonstrates how complicated it can be. Picture a company that\'s about to announce earnings. Some investors/traders (from here on, ""agents"") will have purchased the company\'s stock a while ago, with the expectation that the company will have strong earnings and grow going forward. Other agents will have sold the stock short, bought put options, etc. with the expectation that the company won\'t do as well in the future. Still others may be unsure about the future of the company, but still expecting a lot of volatility around the earnings announcement, so they\'ll have bought/sold the stock, options, futures, etc. to take advantage of that volatility.  All of these various predictions, expectations, etc. factor into what agents are bidding and asking for the stock, its associated derivatives, and other securities, which in turn determines its price (along with overall economic factors, like the sector\'s performance, interest rates, etc.) It can be very difficult to determine exactly how markets are factoring in information about an event, though. Take the example in your question. The article states that if market expectations of higher interest rates tightened credit conditions... In this case, lenders could expect higher interest rates in the future, so they may be less willing to lend money now because they expect to earn a higher interest rate in the future. You could also see this reflected in bond prices, because since interest rates are inversely related to bond prices, higher interest rates could decrease the value of bond portfolios. This could lead agents to sell bonds now in order to lock in their profits, while other agents could wait to buy bonds because they expect to be able to purchase bonds with a higher rate in the future.  Furthermore, higher interest rates make taking out loans more expensive for individuals and businesses. This potential decline in investment could lead to decreased revenue/profits for businesses, which could in turn cause declines in the stock market. Agents expecting these declines could sell now in order to lock in their profits, buy derivatives to hedge against or ride out possible declines, etc. However, the current low interest rate environment makes it cheaper for businesses to obtain loans, which can in turn drive investment and lead to increases in the stock market. This is one criticism of the easy money/quantitative easing policies of the US Federal Reserve, i.e. the low interest rates are driving a bubble in the stock market. One quick example of how tricky this can be. The usual assumption is that positive economic news, e.g. low unemployment numbers, strong business/residential investment, etc. will lead to price increases in the stock market as more agents see growth in the future and buy accordingly. However, in the US, positive economic news has recently led to declines in the market because agents are worried that positive news will lead the Federal Reserve to taper/stop quantitative easing sooner rather than later, thus ending the low interest rate environment and possibly tampering growth.  Summary: In short, markets incorporate information about an event because the buyers and sellers trade securities based on the likelihood of that event, its possible effects, and the behavior of other buyers and sellers as they react to the same information. Information may lead agents to buy and sell in multiple markets, e.g. equity and fixed-income, different types of derivatives, etc. which can in turn affect prices and yields throughout numerous markets.']",0

To understand how this works, it\'s helpful to think about how a lock and key work. When you insert a key into a lock, the teeth on the key match up with the pins inside the lock. The pins are held in place by a spring, and when the key is turned, it pushes the pins up to a certain level. If the pins are all at the right height, the lock will open. To make a master key, the locksmith creates a special key that has extra teeth on it.

They enter the bloodstream , and are dispersed to every part of your body . However , the compounds involved may only be usable by certain chemical processes in specific parts of the body .

' It does n't actually ' search ' or make any decisions at all . What 's happening is it 's going EVERY direction , and the direction that discharges the most energy is by definition the path of least resistance . Another example is social insects , such as ants . When initially searching for food , they start what 's essentially a prior set of rules , that has them initially spreading out in EVERY direction . These worker ants will keep going outwards until death or until it finds food . When it finds food and traces its steps back to the nest it lays a second layer of pheromones ( scent markers ) . When an ant detects a double layer it may reroute to that path and continue to bring back food particles , laying more and more double layers , increasing the odds an ant will choose that pathing . The way it works it never needed an individual worker ant to know where to go or to make a conscience decision , because in the case of ants , the information is n't available and it 's more efficient to have the decision making process already decided for the workers . For the medication , It never ' decides ' on what tissue to attach to . The molecules just floats around in EVERY direction and attach to something because when it went by it got stuck there . The problem here is that we 're wrongly applying human - like traits to these concepts . Conscience decisions are n't necessary for something to happen .

Please explain like I'm five.","['Former aircrew here , and have had missiles fired at my aircraft before . /u / GhostfromTexas is correct , but I may be able to offer some detail . There are a few types of "" lock "" that are possible , and each missile is typically focused on one . Each airframe \'s specific countermeasures are different , but they all start with determining threat / danger . First , heat - seeking . This type has the missile look for thermal energy . Once the missile can ID a target above threshold and within range , it is considered "" attempting to create lock "" or "" locking "" . "" Lock "" is achieved when the missile has above X% chance of success , which is determined by software and differs based on mechanical characteristics . Some missiles at this point are still "" passive "" , meaning they are only receiving energy instead of broadcasting to find their target . The first step for "" lock - prevention "" is reducing heat signature . It \'s very noticeable with the F-22 and F-35 . Achieving / maintaining "" lock "" for these requires you to be basically right behind the exhaust , and you can lose "" lock "" easily if they turn sharp enough to block line - of - sight . The second step is flares . These work by providing a bigger heat signature , i.e. a bigger target . The missile "" bites off "" on the flare , it ignores the airframe and follows the flare away , and it either explodes or runs out of fuel . The second major type used is "" active radar "" . This is where the missile sends out a "" ping "" that bounces off the enemy and back . "" Locking "" starts with the first "" ping "" received and becomes "" lock "" after a predetermined amount ( and above X% chance of success - all missiles base "" lock "" on probabilities ) . It follows the target by continually "" pinging "" and adjusting flight . "" Lock - prevention "" starts with stealth characteristics , which involve ensuring the "" ping "" travels anywhere except back to the source . Second , the "" ping "" activates a system that automatically processes threat / danger . Depending on the system , it may automatically deploy countermeasures or it may simply alert you . The last common method is "" anti - radar "" . Every airframe is broadcasting a signal of location / identification , commonly referred to as "" Identify Friend / Foe "" , or IFF ( Note : it may be called something else in civilian planes ) . For most civilian planes it is used for avoiding collisions and ensuring location . Military have an extra "" Mode "" used to denote "" Blue Force "" or "" Red Force "" , and is used to prevent friendly fire . "" Anti - radar "" missiles will "" lock "" onto the energy broadcast outward . They continually adjust as they receive more "" pings "" , and attempt to follow the "" pings "" back to you . For these , the first step in countering is stopping your broadcast if possible . No signal means no "" lock "" . A decoy is possible , but may be too expensive ( weight , money , material , etc . ) for aerial use . For all missiles , there are common limitations imposed : the specific frequencies are usually designed to not conflict with ATC radar , the "" Area - Of - Responsibility "" ( AOR ) is usually well removed from ATC radar locations , they have short range , and missiles are expensive . Relevant side note : ATC is n\'t tracking planes only by radar . They have two parts : tower and radar . Tower focuses on approach / departure / taxi and uses visual control , whereas radar focuses on planes mid - flight between departure and approach . Many places do n\'t have radar coverage , and deconfliction is determined on paper , then instructions are relayed to the pilot . Sorry if I missed something , but feel free to ask anything .

To figure out who won or lost a war game, the pilots and their aircraft are given certain ""points"" based on their actions during the exercise. For example, a pilot who successfully ""shoots down"" another aircraft might be awarded points, while a pilot who gets ""shot down"" themselves might lose points. At the end of the exercise, the points are totaled up and the pilot or team with the most points is declared the winner.

They may negotiate lower fees by agreeing to pay a flat fee for certain services rather than an hourly rate, or by agreeing to a long-term retainer arrangement. It's also important to remember that accountants, lawyers, and doctors have their own businesses to run and need to charge fees that are reasonable and fair for the services they provide. Charging very high fees could lead to a loss of business and reputation. In addition, there are laws and regulations in place to protect consumers from being charged unreasonably high fees for professional services. For example, in the United States, there are laws that prohibit price gouging, which is when a business charges excessively high prices for goods or services during a time of crisis or emergency.

"How do modern mercenaries operate ? It sounds like something illegal to me , but they do exist . How do mercenary organisations form , where do they come from and how are they hired ? Explain like I'm five. ","[""Ha , something I can answer , my thesis for my bachelor of political science is completely on Dutch private military companies . In the current scientific terminology mercenaries are actually defined as contractors , calling them mercenaries was considered pretty old fashioned by the private military company directors I interviewed . Contractors are defined as military personnel that do not work directly for a government but for a company . A lot of states , especially the US , have started to use these companies a lot over the last decades . In 2007 for example 54 % of US defense personnel in Afghanistan were contractors and not US state troops . Contractors are deployed in a myriad of ways , they fight shoulder to shoulder with American soldiers in the front line but also protect vips or convoys , protect the outer rings of camps or support armies in logistical ways by flying planes or helicopters with vital supplies . They also guard merchant vessels in for example the Gulf of Aden and they help companies that have to deal with kidnappings of personnel in Africa . Contractors have advantages over normal troops in some situations . They are often cheaper to deploy than army equivalents . You do not want elite troops guarding the outer rings of camps in low intensity areas , so it is preferable for states to hire cheap third country contractors to do these relatively simple tasks so that the regular troops do not have to waste their time on patrol duties and can do actual missions . There is some criticisms on this system as some argue that companies should not partake in the monopoly of the use of legal force . This monopoly is the idea that only the state can legally detain you or punish you using force . Now there are companies do basically the same . Fighting wars for states makes it legal for them to kill people sometimes largely to their own discretion . The academic and philosophical debate on whether companies should be allowed to partake in this monopoly on the use of legal force is still raging and something we will have to tackle in the coming decades as the use of private military companies is on the rise . I hope I gave a quick am understandable overview of what pmcs do , I am sadly not with my computer so I ca n't give references for my sources , but if you want to learn more about pmcs authors like Tonkin and Leander are great sources to learn more about this emerging issue ."", 'They are typically formed by ex - military or police officers and are hired just like any other company : you \'d sign a contract with them . Naturally , they do n\'t use the term "" mercenary "" preferring the more subtle term , "" security services . "" You would not hire these companies as an army to fight a war though . Typically they would be contracted for personal security and to train an existing group of men , turning them into soldiers . They would also offer strategic counsel and probably have sources for supplying arms .', ""Mercenaries are just companies that provide people who do work . Swiss mercenaries ( employed by the vatican in an official capacity to guard the pope ) are essentially an officially endorsed state sponsored mercenary arrangement . Nepalese Gurkhas who fight for the British army are something similar . But wholly private mercenaries basically grow out of some former soldier or someone with diplomatic and military connections who can hire people who are going to fight . Ghaddafi hired chadian mercenaries essentially straight out of want ads in , well , chad . Mark Thatcher ( son of former UK Prime minister Margaret ) got into the business through Simon Mann , a former British army officer who was contracted by the Angolan government to provide military services retaking an oil field . The legality of mercenaries is sort of all over the place . If the government of a country hires you to to do work for them , in their own country then presumably the work is by definition legal , at least in the sense that you took a contract you understood to be legal . Using a mercenary force against another country is n't at all obvious when it is or is n't legal . In the case of say , colonial efforts by the americans in Iraq , well , private contractors delivering supplies etc . need guards , so are those guys mercenaries ? ( Yes , but not necessarily ) . If you want to pay some French or Americans or whatever to come to your country and train your army that is presumably legal . But if you want to pay them to come and train your insurgent force to take over the country that usually is n't . Keep in mind that many countries , particularly in Africa and the Middle East have pathetically small armies , that have almost no equipment , no combat experience , no competent leadership , and generally ca n't be trusted to actually fight , or if they do , probably not win . Those countries rely on foreign specialists for their fighting and training needs because they ca n't be bothered to train their own forces for the relatively rare event that they need them . So long as they are fighting non sovereign states ( so pirates , gangs , insurgents , even ISIS ) mercenaries are generally desirable . The situation against ISIS is a fairly good example of why you might need mercenaries . If you do n't trust your own army to not defect , you have a problem ( Syria and Saudi have this problem ) . If you think your army is going to turn and run at the first sign of trouble you have a problem ( the Iraqi 's have this problem ) . If your army refuses to fight during Ramadan , you have a problem . Mercenaries let you overcome a lot of that . Also , Mercenaries , are essentially outside the geneva conventions , they are not considered combatants and not entitled to geneva convention protections explicitly . For that reason they have no motivation to adhere to geneva conventions , and if you intend to do something illegal some mercenaries are happy to torture and stage coups etc , because it ca n't get any worse for them if they are caught and taken prisoner .""]",0

There are many different ways that monarchies can begin, but one common way is for a monarch to be chosen from a royal family, which is a family that has held a royal title for many generations. In some cases, a royal family may have held power for so long that they are considered the ""natural"" rulers of a country, and people may simply accept them as the royal family. For example, the British Royal Family has been ruling the United Kingdom for hundreds of years, and many people in the UK consider them to be the legitimate rulers of the country. In other cases, a royal family may come to power through a combination of historical events, political maneuvering, and military force. For example, the Ottoman Empire was a monarchy that ruled over parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa for hundreds of years. The Ottoman royal family came to power through a combination of military conquest and political alliances, and they were able to maintain their power through a combination of military force and careful diplomacy. Overall, monarchies can begin in many different ways, but they often involve a combination of history, politics, and military power.']",1

How do motherboards and circuit boards get completely ruined by electrostatic discharge ( ESD ) ? Seems like such a small amount of electricity compared to what is drawn from the Power supply Please explain like I'm five.,"[""Electrostatic discharge (ESD) is a sudden flow of electricity between two charged objects. It can happen when two objects with different electrical charges come into contact with each other, or when an object becomes charged by friction or contact with another charged object. \nMotherboards and circuit boards contain many small electronic components, such as transistors and capacitors, which are very sensitive to ESD. When an ESD event occurs, the sudden flow of electricity can damage or destroy these components, rendering the motherboard or circuit board inoperable. \nThink of it like this: Imagine you have a bucket of water and you want to pour it into a glass. If you pour the water slowly, it will fill up the glass without any problems. But if you pour the water too quickly, it might overflow and spill out, causing a mess. It's similar with ESD and electronic components. A small amount of electricity flowing through the component slowly might not cause any damage, but a large, sudden flow of electricity can be too much for the component to handle and it can be damaged or destroyed. \nSo even though the amount of electricity involved in an ESD event might seem small compared to the power drawn from a power supply, it can still be enough to cause serious damage to sensitive electronic components.

It will use the data to decide where the mouse is on the screen , and will incorporate that data into what is being sent to the monitor .

Different parts of the image are associated with additional programming code that make them interactive when the user clicks on them or what have you . The positions of these things are tracked like things on that coordinate plane from Math Class ( X and Y axes representing sideways and up - down ) . All of this is done by the computer . The mouse sends movement information and button press information to the computer . The mouse moves in two axes interpreted as X and Y. It is worth noting that the mouse DOES NOT tell the computer what its position is .

Instead , the mouse tells the computer "" I am moving along the X axis at velocity A and the Y axis at velocity B. "" The computer represents this with the cursor .

With a multi-currency bank account, you can hold balances in the original foreign currencies, which means you can avoid these conversion fees.Another advantage of a multi-currency bank account is that it can provide you with greater flexibility when it comes to managing your finances. For example, if you have a multi-currency bank account, you can hold balances in multiple currencies and transfer funds between them as needed, which can be useful if you need to make payments in different currencies or if you want to take advantage of fluctuations in exchange rates.It is important to note that multi-currency bank accounts may have different fees and requirements than traditional bank accounts, so it is a good idea to compare the features and terms of different accounts before deciding which one is right for you.']",1

When you lift weights in the gym or do other types of physical activity, your muscles have to work hard and become stronger as a result.One key difference between the two is the type of activity that is being done. Lifting weights in the gym usually involves doing specific exercises that target specific muscle groups. When you work, like a lumberjack, your muscles have to work together to perform tasks that involve a variety of movements.Another difference is the duration of the activity. When you lift weights in the gym, you typically do it for a shorter period of time, like an hour. When you work, like a lumberjack, you may do physical activity for a much longer period of time, like a whole day.Overall, both types of muscles can become stronger with regular physical activity, but they may develop differently depending on the type and duration of the activity.']",1

For example, if you use a muscle too much or in an awkward position, it can become sore and develop knots. Similarly, if you have an injury or strain a muscle, knots can form as a result of the muscle healing. Stress and tension can also cause knots to form in the muscles.\\n\\nTo prevent muscular knots, it's important to take care of your muscles by stretching regularly, getting enough rest, and using good posture when you're sitting or standing. You can also try massaging the knots to help them relax, or using heat or cold to reduce inflammation and soreness.\\n\\nIt's not accurate to say that knots are made of blood, but good blood circulation can help to prevent knots from forming.

Please explain like I'm five.","[""Music royalties are payments made to songwriters, composers, and music publishers for the use of their musical works. When a song is played on the radio, streamed on a music service like Spotify, or used in a movie or television show, the copyright holders of the song are entitled to receive a royalty payment. \nThere are different types of music royalties, but one common type is a performance royalty. This is a payment that is made every time a song is performed publicly, such as when it is played on the radio or at a live event. Performance royalties are typically collected by a performing rights organization (PRO), such as ASCAP or BMI, on behalf of the songwriters and composers. \nThe amount of the royalty payment depends on a number of factors, including the type of use (e.g., radio, streaming, live performance), the length of the song, and the specific terms of the license agreement. In general, the longer a song is played, the more the copyright holders will be paid. \nFor example, if a song is used in a movie, the movie studio would typically negotiate a license agreement with the copyright holders (or their representatives) to use the song in the film. The terms of the agreement would determine the amount of the royalty payment, which could be a fixed fee or a percentage of the movie's profits.

It does n't matter whether it 's on earth or in space or on the moon , an object always has the same amount of ' stuff ' in it so it always has the same mass .

This matters where you are , your weight on earth is n't the same as your weight in the moon . Your weight in pounds matters where you are . In fact , it can even go up or down in an elevator when it starts or stops moving . Now weight arises from mass . Gravity pulls mass down , which creates weight . While the strength of gravity may change and so will an objects weight , an object with more mass on any planet will always weigh more than one with less mass . In fixed gravity , the weight is directly proportional to mass . Twice the mass is twice the weight . Now on earth , the easiest way to measure both mass and weight is a scale . The scale measures force , so that can easily tell you your weight in pounds ( or Newtons in metric , though rarely used to describe a human ) . But since earth 's gravity is a constant , and your weight depends on your mass , you can just as easily find mass using it and display kilograms ( or the imperial units for mass called slugs ) . Now if you were to take this earth scale to the moon and stand on it , it would still tell you your correct weight in pounds . It would be less than on earth , but it would still be correct . Your mass in kilograms however would be wrong , the scale was calibrated based on a earth gravity to convert a force into a mass . You would have recalibrate the scale to tell you your correct mass on the moon . Now as I said , the imperial system has a unit for mass called a slug .

The weight of an object depends on its mass and the strength of the gravitational field it is in.Here's an example to help illustrate the difference between mass and weight: Imagine you have a bag of potatoes that weighs 10 pounds on Earth. If you took that same bag of potatoes to the moon, which has a weaker gravitational field than Earth, the bag of potatoes would weigh less than 10 pounds because the force of gravity on the moon is weaker than it is on Earth. However, the mass of the bag of potatoes would still be the same, regardless of whether it is on Earth or the moon.So to summarize, kilograms and pounds are both used to measure mass, but weight is a measure of the force exerted on an object due to gravity and depends on the mass of the object and the strength of the gravitational field it is in.""]",1

So, in a way, the Finnish government is investing in its citizens by providing them with free education. This investment is paid for through taxes, which are collected from people and businesses in Finland. By collecting these taxes, the government is able to fund the services and programs that it thinks are important for the country, such as education, healthcare, and social services. It's also important to note that free university education is just one aspect of the Finnish education system, which is consistently ranked as one of the best in the world. In Finland, education is highly valued and is seen as a right for all citizens, not just a privilege for those who can afford it. This commitment to education is reflected in the country's investment in its education system, which includes not just universities but also schools, teacher training, and other programs.""]",1

Does touch sensitivity decrease due to reduced density ? Please explain like I'm five.,"[""Nerve cells, also called neurons, are responsible for transmitting information throughout the body. They are found all over the body, including in the skin. The number of neurons in the skin does not change based on the size or shape of a person's body. However, the distribution of neurons in the skin can vary based on the size and shape of different body parts. For example, the skin on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet tends to have a higher density of neurons because these areas are used for touch and sensing. In people with more muscle or fat, the skin may have a larger surface area due to the increased size of the muscles or fat deposits. This does not necessarily mean that there are more neurons in the skin, but it could mean that the neurons are more spread out over a larger area. This could potentially affect the sensitivity of the skin, as there may be fewer neurons in a given area. However, the overall sensitivity of the skin is also influenced by other factors such as the type and number of sensory receptors present and the health and function of the neurons.""]",1

How do nukes work ? I know that inside the missile / shell there is radioactive material but how does it create the massive explosion when the missile hits the ground ? Please explain like I'm five.,"['Nuclear weapons work by using the energy stored in the nucleus of an atom to create a powerful explosion. Atoms are made up of tiny particles called protons and neutrons, which are held together by a force called the ""strong nuclear force."" Inside a nuclear weapon, there is a special type of radioactive material called nuclear fuel, which is made up of atoms with a lot of protons and neutrons packed closely together in the nucleus. When the right conditions are met, the strong nuclear force that holds the protons and neutrons together can be overcome, and the nucleus will split into two smaller nuclei. This process is called nuclear fission. During fission, a lot of energy is released in the form of heat and light. This energy can be used to create an explosion. In a nuclear weapon, the energy from the fission process is used to create a chain reaction, where the energy from one fission event is used to cause another fission event, and so on. This chain reaction releases a massive amount of energy all at once, creating a powerful explosion. So, when a nuclear missile hits the ground, the energy from the fission process is released, creating a huge explosion that can cause widespread damage and destruction.']",1

The two main types are fission weapons ( sometimes called atom bombs ) and fusion weapons ( sometimes known as [ thermonuclear weapons ] ( URL_1 ) ) . Both of these devices rely on the special theory of relativity to work . In short , special relativity shows that [ matter and energy are interchangeable ] ( URL_0 ) , and it is possible to free up some of the energy stored as mass . Fission weapons work by splitting atoms . Certain types of atom ( usually Plutonium or [ Uranium ] ( URL_3 ) ) , when given the right conditions , undergo a chain reaction of splitting apart . The mass of the bits it splits into is less than the original mass - some of that mass has been directly converted into energy . For the chain reaction to get going , there needs to be a certain amount of fuel there , called the [ critical mass ] ( URL_4 ) . In fission bombs , two methods are used to make the critical mass . The first method is the gun design , which uses a conventional explosive to ram two pieces of nuclear fuel together . When this happens , it passes the critical mass needed to fission , and the chain reaction begins . The second method is the implosion device , which uses conventional explosives to compress fuel past the critical mass .

They have to be tall to be able to support the long pieces of drill stem that gets poked down into the ground . Once a drilling rig strikes oil , the well is temporarily capped off until the derrick can be dismantled and a pumpjack can be installed ."", ""Oil extraction is based on the difference between the bottom hole pressure and the pressure of the receiving vessel , which we will call dP. Bottom hole pressure is just the pressure at bottom of the oil well , whether it is on land or underwater . In the case of the pumpjack ( the example that you mention ) , the bottom hole pressure is , at most , similar to the pressure of the receiving vessel . Therefore , the pumpjack is utilized to basically draw a vacuum inside the oil well to artificially create a suction motion inside the oil well , effectively pulling the oil up through the pipe and into the receiving vessel . If you think of a plunger and your toilet when its clogged up , you have a pretty good idea of what 's going on . In cases where the bottom hole pressure is significantly higher than the pressure of the receiving vessel , no additional source of suction is required . This is seen on offshore platforms in the Gulf of Mexico . With a high bottom hole pressure , and a low pressure inside the receiving vessel , the high dP will naturally force the oil to go up the pipe .

These rigs have a tall metal structure that sits on the ground, with a big drill bit at the bottom that can dig deep into the earth.\\n\\nTo start drilling, workers first have to find a place where they think there might be oil or natural gas. They use special tools and equipment to test the ground and see if there are any deposits of these substances. If they think there is oil or natural gas in a certain area, they will set up a land rig on that spot.\\n\\nThe land rig has a long pipe called a ""drill string"" that is attached to the drill bit at the bottom. The drill string is made up of many smaller pipes that fit inside each other. To start drilling, the workers use a big engine to turn the drill bit at the bottom of the drill string. The drill bit is made of very hard material, like diamonds or tungsten, and it can cut through the rock and soil as it turns.\\n\\nAs the drill bit digs deeper into the ground, the workers use the engine to raise and lower the rig. This helps them control how deep they are drilling, and it also helps them bring the drill bit back up to the surface when they need to change it or fix it.\\n\\nOnce the drill bit has dug deep enough, the workers will start pumping a special mixture of water, sand, and chemicals down the drill string. This mixture is called ""drilling mud,"" and it helps to cool the drill bit and keep it clean. It also helps to keep the walls of the hole from collapsing.\\n\\nIf the workers find oil or natural gas while they are drilling, they will use a special pipe called a ""casing"" to line the walls of the hole. This helps to keep the oil or natural gas from leaking out of the ground. Once the casing is in place, the workers will install a pump at the bottom of the hole to bring the oil or natural gas up to the surface.\\n\\nI hope that helps to explain how oil rigs work!

","['Well , the cells do n\'t exactly "" know "" what the DNA means , per se . The process of converting genes ( DNA ) into their functional output , typically proteins , begins with a process called transcription . During this process , an enzyme ( a type of protein ) scans the DNA and makes a copy of a gene . But , instead of copying it in the form of DNA , it makes a copy of it in the form of RNA . A good analogy to this would be if your mother emailed you a recipe and you did n\'t have a printer handy , so you wrote instead , you write it down . The message still says the same thing , but it is in printed handwriting instead of electronic data . The next step in the process is converting that RNA information into something that is functional , a protein . This happens in a cell structure called the ribosome . The newly created RNA enters the ribosome , and through a process called translation . Essentially , the ribosome "" decodes "" the RNA and translates it into the language or proteins . A cells in every living organism convert the RNA information into proteins using the same genetic code by reading it in three letter ( A , C , G , T ) chunks called codons . The codons tell the ribosome how to build the protein and when to stop adding pieces . These pieces are called amino acids . Going back to the analogy , this is like you reading the recipe , combining the ingredients , and cooking it in the correct way . Protein translation is essentially the same thing , turning 1 - dimensional information into a 3 - dimensional product . Now , if you are asking how the cell knows which genes to activate or not to activate , that is another discussion . I would be more than willing to discuss that as well if you are interested .', ""At the most basic level , DNA is a code that contains genes , which are instructions for making proteins . Proteins are the main functional molecules in cells . DNA is transcribed into mRNA , which is then translated into a chain of amino acids that fold up to form a protein . Three - base sequences of DNA / RNA called ' codons ' code for different amino acids . DNA contains more information than just the recipes for different proteins , however . There are regulatory regions of DNA that help control when different genes are being made into proteins ."", ""All of the responses so far are very lengthy so if you want a tldr : some of the molecules in your body are able to attach to your dna and change shape slightly depending on which part of a dna they attach to .

"How do our eyes see the color pink ? It 's not on the rainbow , so I 'm just wondering . Please explain like I'm five.","['Great question!

Think of shyness as a behavior , it 's being fearful in social situations - while introversion is a motivation - it 's how much you need / require those social interactions . Also , though temperament is genetically based , I think it 's wrong to think that everyone fits neatly into one of the two boxes . According to Susan Cain , somewhere between one - third and one - half of Americans are introverted ; huge discrepancy but basically , people who live in America are thought to be more extroverted . On the contrary , people living in Eastern Europe or Japan are supposedly mostly introverted on average . If temperament is suppose to be an innate trait , we should n't see these differences . I would argue that most people lie somewhere in the middle and force themselves in these arbitrary boxes . I think once you ( OP ) stop thinking in concrete terms , and once you let go of the idea that because you 're shy that you 're an introvert , you 'll have a better understanding of how people can seem more extroverted than you .""]",0
How do people become introverts / extroverts ? I my self an introvert and feel like i can never understand extroverts . Even when we have such similar personalities and interests . What makes me so shy and them so outgoing ? Explain like I'm five.,"['Introverts and extroverts are just different types of people, and there are many factors that can influence whether someone is more introverted or extroverted. One of the main differences between introverts and extroverts is the way they get their energy. Introverts tend to get their energy from being alone or with a small group of people, while extroverts get their energy from being around other people and being more social. There are also a number of other factors that can contribute to whether someone is more introverted or extroverted. For example, some people may be naturally more introverted or extroverted due to their genetics or brain chemistry. Other people may become more introverted or extroverted based on their life experiences and the way they were raised. So, in short, people become introverts or extroverts due to a combination of their natural tendencies, their environment, and their life experiences. It\'s important to remember that everyone is different and that there is no ""right"" or ""wrong"" way to be. It\'s okay to be an introvert or an extrovert, and it\'s important to embrace your unique personality and the way you like to interact with the world.']",1

Other people may become morbidly obese due to unhealthy eating habits and a lack of physical activity. It's also possible for people to have a combination of these and other factors that contribute to their weight gain.\r\n\r\nOne way to think about it is that when we eat more calories than we burn through physical activity and everyday life, our bodies store the excess calories as fat.

On the other hand, when we eat fewer calories than we burn, our bodies use stored fat for energy, which can lead to weight loss.\r\n\r\nIt's important to note that everyone's bodies are different, and what works for one person in terms of diet and exercise may not work for another.

People can become physically addicted to a substance even if they take breaks from consuming it while sleeping. This is because the body can build up a tolerance to the substance, which means that it takes more of the substance to achieve the same effect as before. As a result, people may feel the need to use the substance more often or in larger amounts in order to feel the desired effects. Additionally, the body can also go through withdrawal when a person stops using a substance that they have become physically dependent on.

"How do people construct tunnels underwater ? Like the one between France and the Uk . It may be a silly question , I know . I just do n't have a clue how they get rid of the water and stuff ! Explain like I'm five.","[""Building a tunnel underwater is a complex process that requires careful planning and the use of specialized equipment. Here's a simplified explanation of how it works:\r\n\r\nFirst, engineers will survey the area to determine the best route for the tunnel to take. They will consider factors such as the depth of the water, the type of soil and rock beneath the water, and the distance between the two points the tunnel will connect.\r\n\r\nOnce the route has been determined, a trench is dug in the seabed to create a path for the tunnel. This is usually done using a machine called a tunnel boring machine, or TBM. The TBM digs through the soil and rock, creating a tunnel as it goes.\r\n\r\nAs the TBM digs, it also installs segments of pre-cast concrete to line the walls of the tunnel. These segments are placed one after the other, forming a continuous ring around the tunnel.\r\n\r\nThe water in the tunnel is pumped out as the TBM digs, using a system of pumps and pipes. This helps to keep the tunnel dry and safe for workers.\r\n\r\nOnce the tunnel is complete, it is sealed and waterproofed to prevent water from seeping in. This is usually done using a layer of concrete or other waterproof material on the outside of the tunnel.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.""]",1

"How do people decipher ancient writing / symbols ? For example , hieroglyphics . How do you even begin to understand them ? Is there a standard procedure ? Please explain like I'm five.","['To understand ancient writing, historians and archaeologists use a variety of techniques and tools. One way to decipher ancient writing is by finding texts that are written in both the ancient language and a language that is already known. For example, the Rosetta Stone is a famous stone slab with inscriptions in three different scripts: Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics, Ancient Egyptian Demotic, and Ancient Greek. By comparing the texts in the three scripts, historians were able to figure out what the hieroglyphics meant.Another way to decipher ancient writing is by studying the context in which the writing appears. For example, if the writing is found on a temple wall, historians might look at the images and symbols that appear alongside the writing to try to understand its meaning.There are also many scholars who specialize in studying and interpreting ancient writing systems, such as hieroglyphics. They use their knowledge of the language, culture, and history of the people who used the writing system to help decipher it.It can take a lot of time and effort to decipher ancient writing, but it can be a very rewarding and exciting process!']",1
"How do people decipher ancient writing / symbols ? For example , hieroglyphics . How do you even begin to understand them ? Is there a standard procedure ? Please explain like I'm five.","['Well , every case is unique . In the case of hieroglyphics , as others here have already pointed out , linguists were very fortunate to have found the Rosetta Stone . But mostly , it \'s a case of using the same kind of techniques used to crack codes and ciphers , except it \'s much more difficult . What linguists are looking for is some kind of pattern , so you really need to find as many examples of the script as you can . It \'s then a laborious process of cataloguing every symbol that appears . How often does it appear ? What other symbols appear with it ? How is it distributed in the text ? For example , suppose a Martian found a few books in English and wanted to decipher it . One of the first things he might notice is that at one corner of each page is a sequence of signs that follow a very regular pattern . He might guess that this is a counting system , and that each page was carefully numbered . This is actually a huge help , because not only does he know that we use a decimal counting system , but he knows which order the pages are intended to be read in , which also allows him to deduce that we read from left to right . On looking at the text , he notices that there is a relatively small number of different symbols , but they are grouped into clusters . So perhaps he \'s looking at a writing system that uses an alphabet , with symbols representing sounds grouped into words . Some of these words appear quite often : "" the "" , "" a "" , "" an "" , "" it "" , "" is "" and so on are very common , so perhaps they have some kind of grammatical function . A lot of words seem to end in "" ing "" or "" ed "" , so maybe those are grammatical markers as well . He would probably notice that the sequence "" the "" never occurs at the beginning of a line or after a "" . "" symbol , but in those positions he often sees the sequence "" The "" . If he \'s really on the ball here , he \'d realize that "" T "" and "" t "" are two variants of the same letter . Looking back at all the statistics he \'s collected about the frequency of certain symbols and where they occur , he \'ll notice many more such pairs , and this would allow him to deduce that English uses an alphabet with two forms for each letter , and one of those forms ( which is usually bigger and more "" blocky "" looking than the other ) has some significance . It \'s through this kind of process that he gradually builds up a picture of the English language . If he has a way of knowing what kind of book he \'s holding in his tentacles ( "" Wait , is that a representation of an atom ? Could this be a chemistry textbook ? "" ) , he \'s well on his way to deciphering the text ( "" If this represents a proton and an orbiting electron , then that must be the word for \' hydrogen \' "" ) .', 'The story of the Rosetta Stone is great . I visit it at the British Museum a few times a year , and the story of it is just fantastic . In 1799 a soldier involved in Napoleon \'s Egyptian expedition finds this stone , and straight away it \'s obvious it could be useful because its context suggests that it \'s the same text in multiple languages . It has upon it a decree from King Ptolemy V in 196 BC in three languages : hieroglyphs , demotic script and ancient Greek . The decree is basically a "" Yo , Ptolemy V and his wife are totally boss and all the priests are like super impressed and stuff , and you should be too , \' k ? "" style of message . By 1801 they were still struggling with understanding the Greek . Basically , whilst scholars have a good handle on ancient Greek , it \'s full of weird administrative jargon and bits of it were missing , so it took a while to sort that out . Then there is the middle section in Demotic . Hardly anybody knew how to read this , but there was this Swedish guy who had a bit of a handle on it , and could confirm that it was indeed the same text as the Greek , so that meant the hieroglyphs were likely to be the same text too . In 1811 a man called Silvestre de Sacy is thinking about the problem and considering a suggestion that the foreign names in hieroglyphs are phonetic . He does nothing about it until another guy called Thomas Young , wrote to him about the stone in 1814 , when de Sacy suggests he finds the cartouches that might contain Greek names , and see if he can find phonetic characters in them . Thomas Young does so and decodes the name of Ptolemy and a bunch of other characters as a result . This is good result . Later that year he is exchanging letters with a teacher in Grenoble who has written scholarly works on Egypt called Jean - François Champollion . Champollion takes another look at his lithograph of the stone and is able to find the cartouche for "" kleopatra "" and realises he can build a phonetic alphabet . It takes another 20 years for Champollion to fill in the gaps , but he and others do so and by 1832 there is a good understanding of what \'s going on . Those 20 years were spent trying to understand grammar and making all sorts of leaps of faith and trying to figure out how closely it resembled Demotic script and Greek . It \'s slow , methodical work . So in this case it \'s clear that the trick was a bunch of accidents and sharing of knowledge based on hunches and publication of pieces of the puzzle and a lot of hard work .', 'In 1799 , the [ Rosetta Stone ! ] ( URL_0 ) was found which provided a decree in three different languages : Greek , Demotic , and Hieroglyphic .

The time difference from when you first see the Flames to when you are literally being burned by the Flames can be 2 to 3 minutes . Now you might say that it is possible to get away from a fire in 2 to 3 minutes but I 'll remind you that in most places of the world roads do not go directly away from disasters . Especially in places that are literally valleys or Canyons where there are only one or two roads out of an area meaning sometimes your last evacuation route is actually towards the flames and you need to just shelter in place . Sheltering in place can be an acceptable Last Resort but considering the raw power of a firestorm there 's really no hope , we 're even seeing melted engine blocks from the devastation areas so there 's really nothing you can do to hide from it . For those in the path if they did not evacuate when it was 25 miles away ( the next town over ) they may not have had a chance to leave at all . So stop and consider what is 25 miles away from you , and think that if that was a natural disaster , would you evacuate from your city just because of what 's happening 25 miles away ? Also the next time you 're on the freeway think about a wall of flame the height of a large building going that speed ."", 'a wildfire breaks out 50 miles from you . do you evacuate ? probably not . with wind , fire can travel 10 mph . that fire that was 50 miles away from you when you went to bed is now on top of you when you wake up in the morning .']",0
"How do people die in wildfires ? It ’s not like the area spontaneously combusts , do n’t people have ample time to get to safety ? Explain like I'm five. ","['Wildfires are fires that burn out of control in natural areas such as forests, grasslands, and prairies. They can be caused by lightning, but most are started by people. Wildfires can be very dangerous and can cause people to die in several ways.\\n\\nFirst, the fire itself can burn people. If someone is caught in the middle of a wildfire, the flames and heat can burn their skin and clothes, causing serious injuries or even death.\\n\\nSecond, the smoke from a wildfire can be very dangerous to breathe in. Wildfires produce a lot of smoke, which can make it hard to see and can make it difficult to breathe. People who are caught in a wildfire and try to escape may inhale too much smoke, which can cause them to have trouble breathing and can even cause them to lose consciousness.\\n\\nFinally, people can also die in a wildfire if they are unable to escape the fire or find a safe place to shelter. Wildfires can spread very quickly and can be very hard to predict. If someone is in an area that is being burned by a wildfire and cannot find a way to escape, they may be in danger.\\n\\nIt is important for people to be prepared for wildfires and to know what to do if one occurs. This includes having an evacuation plan and knowing how to stay safe during a wildfire.\\n']",1

Because there is no gravity in space, food and drinks don't stay in one place like they do on Earth. This can make it a bit tricky to eat and drink, because the food and drinks can float around and be hard to hold onto. \nTo eat in space, astronauts use special utensils that are designed to be used in zero gravity. These utensils are often attached to the food packaging or to a tray so they don't float away. The food itself is also often packed in special containers that are easy to open and eat from in space. \nDrinking in space can be a bit trickier, because liquids tend to float around and can be hard to control. To drink in space, astronauts use special containers with straws or tubes that they can suck on to get the liquid to flow into their mouths. They also have to be careful not to drink too much at once, because the liquid could float out of their mouths and make a mess. \nOverall, eating and drinking in space requires some special tools and techniques, but it's not too different from how we do it on Earth. It just takes a little bit of practice to get used to it!""]",1

Crossing the border between North and South is a very bad idea - It 's littered with mines , heavily guarded and it 's almost guaranteed you 'll be shot . Although the Chinese border is also heavily guarded , this factor can be overcome by bribes - normally cigarettes , money and/or food will be sufficient . A position on the Border is a highly desirable role for this reason . Nonetheless , the hardest part is the actual crossing . The Tumen is typically very cold and very deep - if you watch some of the documentaries covering this topic , they may show scenes of the vast number of dead bodies scattered across the river . However , the river is occasionally frozen making the crossing somewhat easier . Once in China , your safety is far from secure . China has an agreement with North Korea that any refugees caught will be sent back - it 's been rumoured this will be abolished in the near future due to friction between the two countries . If you are caught , chances are you 'll be sent to a prison camp and possibly released in the future . However , if caught again it 's almost certain you 'll be executed . Futhermore , defecting in China is increasingly strenuous due to the embassies in China being heavily guarded to stop defectors claiming assylum . If you do set foot on the embassy 's land , the Chinese government will permit individuals to leave for South Korea . In this [ video ] ( URL_0 ) , a family of North Koreans attempt to enter the South Korean embassy . Anyway , from China there 's several other options as to get to South Korea .

"How do people get "" upgraded "" seats on planes ? I sometimes hear about people getting upgraded to business / first class seats . Is this something that happens randomly ? Or does it have anything to do with being a frequent flyer ? Please explain like I'm five.","[""There are several ways that people can get upgraded to a better class of service on a plane, such as business or first class. Here are a few possibilities: \n1. Being a frequent flyer: Some airlines offer their frequent flyers (people who fly with them a lot) the opportunity to get upgraded to a better class of service as a reward for their loyalty. This is often done through a frequent flyer program, where passengers earn points for every flight they take and can then redeem those points for upgrades or other rewards. \n2. Having a higher fare class: Sometimes, people who purchase more expensive tickets are more likely to get upgraded to a better class of service. This is because the airline may have more availability in the higher classes and may be more willing to offer upgrades to people who have paid more for their tickets. \n3. Asking at the airport: It's always worth asking at the airport if there are any upgrades available, especially if you are willing to pay a little extra. Sometimes, airlines will have a few seats available in a higher class and will be willing to sell them at a discount, especially if the flight is not full. \n4. Being a VIP or celebrity: Sometimes, people who are well-known or important are offered upgrades as a gesture of goodwill. This is often done to help ensure that these high-profile individuals have a pleasant travel experience. \nOverall, getting upgraded to a better class of service on a plane is not something that happens randomly, but it can be influenced by a variety of factors such as frequent flyer status, fare class, and even celebrity status.""]",1

There are rare instances where we upgrade for out of convenience ( upgrading to redistribute the weight of the aircraft , when coach is oversold , or when we need to seat a family together and you just get lucky ) , but these situations are pretty unusual . There are also instances where an agent may spontaneously just upgrade people ( dependent on airline policy ) . If there are seats available and I know you are experiencing a major life event ( marriage / honeymoon , anniversary , family member death / dying / severe illness ) , but this generally because of something written in your reservation and not because you have been parroting up and down the concourse .

Explain like I'm five.,"[""Cigarette smoking is not immediately addictive for everyone, but for many people, it can become addictive over time. This is because cigarettes contain a drug called nicotine, which is highly addictive. When a person smokes a cigarette, the nicotine is quickly absorbed into their bloodstream and travels to the brain, where it can cause changes in the brain's chemistry that make the person feel good. At first, smoking may not seem addictive because the effects of nicotine are relatively mild. However, as a person continues to smoke, their body becomes used to the nicotine and may start to crave it when it's not there. This is what can lead to addiction. It's important to note that smoking is a very unhealthy habit and can cause serious health problems, including lung cancer, heart disease, and many other diseases. It's not easy to pick up this habit, and it's best to avoid it altogether if possible.""]",1

And it was comfortable , so much that I was able to sleep there like I was sleeping in the softest king bed . Until my mother woke me up , telling me a client of hers we both knew was coming , and she should really not see me sleeping in the office . I said okay , made an effort and sit up on one chair and took off the cardigan I usually take on if it \'s a bit cold . Yawned some and started to talk about the client \'s tax problems with my mother ... Except she was waking me up again , and I had to realize that the last few happenings were just a very , very realistic dream . I thought it kinda sucks , sometimes I experienced this when waking up in the morning , when the snooze alarm goes on while I \'m dreaming about brushing my teeth . So I got up again , took off the cardigan , walked to the desk where I left some tea in a cup , drank it , and started to talk with my mother ... Only she was waking me up again . I started to feel really annoyed at this point but had to carry on , so I woke up , took of the cardigan , started talking to mom . The client arrived , I greeted her , asked her about her kids ... And then mom was waking me up again . And I dreamed something awfully realistic , again . And then she woke me up again . I ca n\'t quite remember how many times this repeated , but at the end it became unbearably awful . To top this , upon one realization , a mean little voice was kind enough to tell me that no matter how many times I \'ll wake up , it \'ll never be real . Finally I managed to wake up for real ( or at least that is what still think , ha - ha ) , and I sat there on one of the chairs , hugging my legs , wondering if I have gone insane or not , if it is real or not , asking mom again and again if it is really happening . Slowly the feeling started to pass and finally I snapped out of it but that ten or so minutes were like , well , peeking into the room where craziness dwells through the keyhole and seeing a bloodshot eye looking back at you . I believe I came really close to the edge that time . I guess if my mother did n\'t realize how serious it was and made joke like \' yeah , you \'re still dreaming , fun , ai n\'t it \' , I might have gone loony . tl;dr Coming close to the edge after not being able to wake up properly .

"How do people go crazy ? I 've heard about people "" going crazy , "" or insane , and I 'm just wondering how that actually happens . Could a perfectly healthy person go crazy later in their lives ? Explain like I'm five.","['Going ""crazy"" or ""insane"" is not a medical term, and it\'s not something that happens to people in the way that you might catch a cold or break a bone. Mental health problems, including conditions like depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia, can cause people to feel and behave differently than they usually do. These conditions can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetics, life experiences, and brain chemistry. It is possible for a person who was previously healthy to develop a mental health condition later in life, just as it is possible for a person to develop a physical health condition. It\'s important to remember that mental health problems are not the person\'s fault, and that with the right help, most people can get better.']",1

Could an old money prepster from Connecticut pass as white trash if he dressed a certain way and maybe spoke a bit differently ? Sure . It 's not really an ethnic thing .

However , I \'m pointing out the fact that I live in an upper middle class area and so my answer will reflect my understanding and observations of this question , as compared to answering your entire question definitely . As all societies , class is relatively easily distinguished between . The area you live in , the way you speak , dress and behave all act as identifying factors . With caste , it \'s not so simple . There are thousands of castes in India , I \'m not sure of the exact number . Now , with the progression of society , many of the lower castes have risen up to make a decent living for themselves and can be indistinguishable from the general public . Of course , you could recognise the caste of people based on the general area and general physical features but you can never surely identify someone based on this . The last names of people usually can be an identifying factor of their caste , as people of the same caste share a set of last names . This is not true in all cases as the ancestors of certain lower caste members changed their surnames to something that was not associated with their caste in order to prevent discrimination from people from "" upper castes "" In today \'s day , I would say it \'s hard to identify someone \'s caste off hand but it \'s really not required day to day . Almost no one uses the old caste system , so it does n\'t really matter what caste you belong to . I doubt anyone apart from people living in extremely rural areas still maintain the practice of using a person \'s caste to judge their worth . Although one major fact that should be known is the governments current view on castes . Government institutions especially colleges and universities have reserved seats for SC / ST(Scheduled Castes / Scheduled Tribes ) so that they are not at a disadvantage in gaining seats for a course because of their background . While this does help people from less priveleged backgrounds get good education , it also causes a lot of people to take unfair advantage of the system . A lot of people who are well off and have a good education and living condition get to use the reserved quota system for their benefit even though they do n\'t need it . This reservation system also causes a whole lot of problem for the general category of people(which is a lot of people ) to get seats in university because barely any seats are left for them because of the reserved seats .

Assuming your conceptual vocabulary veers towards normal , you \'d know you ca n\'t write with a banana and you ca n\'t drive a banana . This is based on an entire lifetime of seeing bananas , eating bananas and just in general , your brain \'s natural association with an abstract sound connecting to a piece of our reality that associates meaning back to our brain . When we learn language as a child , our brains are connecting the dots between the language around us and the world around us . That \'s why it \'s so important to expose kids to a variety of different experiences , as well as explaining those experiences and things to the child . Babies and kids need to hear and interact with language while growing up because it activates their brain for more language . The usual rule is that kids really need to be exposed to vast amounts of language and experiences by age 5 because our brains are hardwired to use those first five years to really absorb all those really complicated parts of a language , such as grammar and cultural factors and social cues . Research has been done on young children about their understanding of grammar and it \'s amazing how they understand really complicated abstract grammar simply based on them knowing what "" sounds "" right and what "" sounds "" wrong . That \'s based on exposure , parents and adults teaching them how to use it , correcting them when they use it wrong . If you want to read up more about this need for constant stimulus required for language development , you can look into the story of Genie . She was a kid who was locked in a crib since birth and who was basically neglected and alone until she was discovered at 13 . Even after she was rescued , she never developed language skills because she was so deprived for so long at so young that her brain never trigger first language . Her language skills improved while some researchers were working with her , but once the researched stopped and she was put in a home for the mentally ill , her skills rapidly regressed because she just was n\'t being exposed to language anymore . If you \'re talking about how we can move to a different country and slowly grow to learn the language , it \'s about how we \'re connecting the dots of the new language around us with our existing knowledge of conceptual vocabulary as well as our understanding of our first language . It \'s similar to how we learn language as a child , but since we already have our first language , learning a second language is more based on connecting the world , our existing language and our conceptual language together . That \'s why learning nouns and verbs are always easier when learning a second language , while grammar is probably a bit more difficult when it \'s not related to our first language . That \'s why we point and gesture and try to mine actions if we \'re in a country where we do n\'t speak the language . I can hold up a banana and I call it a banana while a person who only speaks Tagalog knows it as saging , but we both understand the banana , when green it \'s underripe , yellow is good , mushy or black spots is bad , etc . etc . It \'s when you start discussing abstract things that you need to begin factoring in cultural social elements and how it affects reality and how your first language / culture understanding of the world and its relation to the second language / culture \'s understanding of the world . The biggest obstacle on why a lot of people "" ca n\'t "" learn a second language is mostly psychological and contextual rather than sheer ability . We correct children all the time when they use improper grammar or use a vocabulary word incorrectly , we also go out of our way to explain things to children so their understanding of the world keeps on growing . A lot of adult language learners might have a hard time taking corrections or what they perceive as "" criticisms "" . We also have to immerse and surround the learner with an environment just filled with fluent speakers . When someone moves to another country , if they completely immerse themselves , meaning no exposure to their first language , then they will pick up the language so much faster compared to someone who frequents ex - pat areas or still uses their first language to write and read . Conversing with fluent speakers helps us test our language ability and for us to read and note when we say things right and when we say things wrong . We self - adjust and that just accumulates to the point where if we correct often enough , we \'ll get to a point where we do n\'t make many mistakes anymore . While bilingual children have an easier time learning a third or fourth language compared to monolingual children , if you have an ability to speak and understand a language , you can learn another language . It \'s just a factor of effort and placing yourself in the right context with the right frame of mind .', ""I think the human brain is hardwired for it .

When you first start, you might not understand much of what's going on, but as you keep playing and practicing, you'll start to understand more and more. One way that people learn a new language is by listening to others speak it. They might not understand every single word at first, but they can start to pick up on patterns and sounds that are common in the language. They can also try to use context clues, like the person's body language or the things around them, to figure out what is being said. Another way to learn a new language is by speaking it yourself. Even if you don't know all the words, you can try to imitate the sounds and rhythms that you hear. As you practice speaking, you'll start to learn more words and phrases, and you'll get better at using them correctly. Finally, it can be helpful to study the grammar and rules of the language, so you can understand how it all fits together. This can be especially helpful if you're having trouble understanding more complex conversations. So, to summarize, learning a new language takes a lot of practice and patience.

The usual rule is that kids really need to be exposed to vast amounts of language and experiences by age 5 because our brains are hardwired to use those first five years to really absorb all those really complicated parts of a language , such as grammar and cultural factors and social cues . Research has been done on young children about their understanding of grammar and it \'s amazing how they understand really complicated abstract grammar simply based on them knowing what "" sounds "" right and what "" sounds "" wrong . That \'s based on exposure , parents and adults teaching them how to use it , correcting them when they use it wrong . If you want to read up more about this need for constant stimulus required for language development , you can look into the story of Genie . She was a kid who was locked in a crib since birth and who was basically neglected and alone until she was discovered at 13 . Even after she was rescued , she never developed language skills because she was so deprived for so long at so young that her brain never trigger first language . Her language skills improved while some researchers were working with her , but once the researched stopped and she was put in a home for the mentally ill , her skills rapidly regressed because she just was n\'t being exposed to language anymore . If you \'re talking about how we can move to a different country and slowly grow to learn the language , it \'s about how we \'re connecting the dots of the new language around us with our existing knowledge of conceptual vocabulary as well as our understanding of our first language . It \'s similar to how we learn language as a child , but since we already have our first language , learning a second language is more based on connecting the world , our existing language and our conceptual language together . That \'s why learning nouns and verbs are always easier when learning a second language , while grammar is probably a bit more difficult when it \'s not related to our first language . That \'s why we point and gesture and try to mine actions if we \'re in a country where we do n\'t speak the language . I can hold up a banana and I call it a banana while a person who only speaks Tagalog knows it as saging , but we both understand the banana , when green it \'s underripe , yellow is good , mushy or black spots is bad , etc . etc . It \'s when you start discussing abstract things that you need to begin factoring in cultural social elements and how it affects reality and how your first language / culture understanding of the world and its relation to the second language / culture \'s understanding of the world . The biggest obstacle on why a lot of people "" ca n\'t "" learn a second language is mostly psychological and contextual rather than sheer ability . We correct children all the time when they use improper grammar or use a vocabulary word incorrectly , we also go out of our way to explain things to children so their understanding of the world keeps on growing . A lot of adult language learners might have a hard time taking corrections or what they perceive as "" criticisms "" . We also have to immerse and surround the learner with an environment just filled with fluent speakers . When someone moves to another country , if they completely immerse themselves , meaning no exposure to their first language , then they will pick up the language so much faster compared to someone who frequents ex - pat areas or still uses their first language to write and read . Conversing with fluent speakers helps us test our language ability and for us to read and note when we say things right and when we say things wrong . We self - adjust and that just accumulates to the point where if we correct often enough , we \'ll get to a point where we do n\'t make many mistakes anymore . While bilingual children have an easier time learning a third or fourth language compared to monolingual children , if you have an ability to speak and understand a language , you can learn another language . It \'s just a factor of effort and placing yourself in the right context with the right frame of mind .', ""I think the human brain is hardwired for it . There was a dude on I Almost Got Away With It who said he learned Spanish / Portugese this way ( ca n't remember which ) . Basically he showed up in South America and for a few months just asked random people what this and that word meant , and before long he was speaking the language fluently . Another couple months he had a job as a teacher which he kept for years until he got busted .""]",0
How do people make aimbots ? Something I 've always been curious about . Explain like I'm five.,"[""An aimbot is a type of software that is designed to help a player aim more accurately in a video game. It does this by predicting where the player's target is going to be and automatically aiming the player's weapon towards that location. Here's a simple example of how an aimbot might work: The player starts a game and begins aiming their weapon at an enemy. The aimbot software runs in the background and constantly tracks the position of the enemy. When the player pulls the trigger, the aimbot calculates the trajectory of the bullet and determines where it will hit the enemy. The aimbot then adjusts the player's aim so that the bullet hits the enemy. Aimbots are often used in first-person shooter games, and they can give players an unfair advantage over their opponents. Because of this, many online games have strict rules against the use of aimbots, and players who are caught using them can be banned from the game. I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.""]",1

How do people reverse engineer a piece of software ? I 've read about it but still not entirely sure . A good eli5 would be greatly appreciated Please explain like I'm five.,"['Any piece of software that runs on an end - user \'s machine is reverse engineerable to a determined enough adversary . The trick is to make it sufficiently difficult that people are disincentivized to try to reverse engineer it . The reason is because by definition , if your computer is running a piece of software , it must know all the necessary information to run that program in the form of binary code , and by extension so do you ( who controls the computer and has lots of time to spare ) . If you open any exe program on your computer in Notepad , you \'ll see what looks like a bunch of gibberish - this is the binary data of the executable . Some of it is metadata about the file and some hard - coded data that your program needs , but a lot of it is code in the form of [ Opcodes ] ( URL_1 ) . Opcodes are like the DNA of a computer program . Each one is short and signifies a specific action ( move this data here , check to see what this data is , jump to this location next , etc . ) and together , all the opcodes make up your program . The art of reading and writing opcodes is mostly lost today , because almost everyone writes in a human - readable programming language ( like C , Java , Python , etc . ) that is later compiled down into opcodes . However , it \'s still critical to certain professions such as malware writers and anti - malware writers . But determining what a program does by its opcodes is still an almost impossible task -- it \'s like trying to figure out how the human brain works if you can only see individual neurons at a time . There are some tricks to this - as others mentioned , testing the program with various inputs will give you hints as to what you should be looking for . It should be noted that trying to figure out what a program does purely by looking at its output ( so - called black - box testing ) is not true reverse engineering -- for one , software can be infinitely complex , and there \'s no guarantee what a program does in one environment is at all what it will do in another environment . For instance , malware will often attempt to detect when they \'re being run on a malware researcher \'s machine , and deliberately change their behavior to act in a more benign manner and throw the "" good guys "" off . [ Stuxnet ] ( URL_0 ) is another good example - it was designed specifically to be harmless on almost all computers , and drop its devastating payload on one and only one machine ( the controller at Tehran \'s nuclear facility ) . The other tool is a good debugger . Just about all operating systems and hardware support some level of debugging . This is where a specialized piece of software ( the debugger ) will tell the operating system "" hey , I see you \'re currently executing another program ( the debugee ) . I \'d like to debug it please . "" The operating system will say "" sure "" , halt the debugee and give the debugger full control over it . The debugger can see the full memory space , what opcodes are currently being executed , it can arbitrarily start and pause the program , mess with the data , set it to pause when certain conditions are met , etc . Going back to the neuron analogy , it would like if brain scientists had the ability to alter or remove whole sets of neurons at will and see how it affects the brain . With a debugger , one of the big things to look for is the pattern of API calls to the operating system . Basically , the operating system acts like a gatekeeper for some of the more advanced features of a computer . Any time a program wants to write memory to disk , access the Internet , print something , or do anything else that extends beyond its capabilities , it needs to ask permission from the operating system thorough what \'s called the OS \'s API . If you \'re using Windows , this API is fairly well documented and well known , and you can hook into these calls using a debugger and be notified any time the program makes one of these calls . It can give you a really good starting point for reversing the rest of the program . The way to circumvent software reverse engineering is to not have the program run on the user \'s machine at all -- make it run somewhere on the Internet instead . This is the idea of "" Software as a Service ( SaaS ) "" . Instead of giving the user a potentially sensitive program to use and trusting them not to reverse it , you ( as a software company ) have the user send you their input , you run the program somewhere on your own machines , then you give them the output back . The user is completely oblivious as to what happened behind the scenes in this scenario .', 'A computer program - or a piece of software - is just a list of instructions . An * incredibly complex and long * list of instructions , mind you . But a list of instructions , nonetheless . What else is a list of instructions ? Baking a cake ! So let \'s use cake as our example instead , because cake does not lie . So , you see a cake sitting on the counter in your kitchen : A frosted black forest chocolate cake , with cherries on top . You wonder how it got there , this miraculous cake . For our purposes , there \'s two different ways to make this cake . > You steal the recipe , follow the instructions , and make the cake or > You know a cake consists of sugar , eggs , water , oil , flour , cocoa , vanilla extract , and cherries . You start blindly throwing ingredients together , baking each concoction , until something that resembles a cake comes out of the oven This is how you reverse engineer software . The first example is * highly * illegal , because someone else made the recipe - it \'s thieving someone else \'s intellectual property ( the recipe on the card ) . Although you have the recipe - you might need to test it out a couple times before you get the correct end result . Regardless , the cake is n\'t your work as you did n\'t write the original recipe . For number two , it \'s completely legal and legitimate because you \'re creating the recipe yourself through trial and error , to * hopefully * come up with an identical end - result . This is called "" clean - room "" engineering , and since you \'re creating the recipe ( or code ) to make the cake , it \'s your own property as you are n\'t stealing from someone else . Be prepared to bake 100 \'s of cakes until you start getting something remotely similar to what \'s on your counter . In software terms - it \'s not necessarily the end result that matters , it \'s how you go about doing it . * * EDIT :* * removed incorrect terms and replaced with "" clean - room "" engineering', 'Reverse engineering is done by looking at the outside of a construction ( software or otherwise ) and by observing how it works , guessing how it \'s built . Sometimes , this means that you get something really , really close to the original , sometimes , you get a colmpletely different construction , which , outwardly , behaves like the original . Occasionally , som constructions allow you to "" get a peek under the hood "" . In that case , you still do n\'t have the original plans , but you get more accurate information on how it \'s build , and can build something more like it . So , for example , ReactOS is a Windows - compatible free operating system . It \'s made by observing how Windows works , and looking at the official documentation of all the calls you as a programmer can do in Windows . So , they see that Windows have a call you can use to , for example , draw a text with a certain font at a specified position of the screen . So , they do their own version of that call . Once they can properly do all the calls you can do in Windows , they have basically done a free Windows clone that does n\'t contain a single line of the original Windows source code .']",0

The homeowner contacts their lender and explains that they need to sell their house but owe more on the mortgage than the house is worth. \n2. The lender reviews the homeowner\'s financial situation and determines whether they are eligible for a short sale. The lender will look at factors such as the homeowner\'s income, the amount of equity in the house, and the homeowner\'s ability to make the mortgage payments. \n3.

The lender will then use this money to pay off the remaining balance on the mortgage. \n5.

How do people smell whiskey / scotch ? All I can really smell when i drink a glass of scotch / whiskey / bourbon is pure alcohol . How do these connoisseurs distinguish the specific smells ? Please explain like I'm five.,"[""When people smell whiskey, they try to pick up on different aromas in the drink. These can include things like the scent of oak barrels that the whiskey was aged in, as well as other smells like honey, vanilla, and caramel. Some people are also able to detect more subtle scents, like flowers or fruit. To smell whiskey, you can take a small sip and then breathe out through your nose, or you can simply sniff the drink from a distance. It can be helpful to take a few small sips and try to identify the different aromas each time, as this can help you pick up on more subtle scents. It's also important to remember that everyone's sense of smell is different, so what one person smells in a whiskey might be different from what someone else smells. With practice and experience, it is possible to become more skilled at detecting different aromas in whiskey.""]",1

"How do people solve rubix cubes in < 10 seconds ? Edit : Rubik 's , my bad . Please explain like I'm five.","['Solving a Rubik\'s Cube quickly involves using a series of specific algorithms and techniques. Here\'s a simplified explanation of how it works:First, the solver looks for any ""solved"" faces on the cube (faces that are all one color). They might start by looking for a white face, for example.Next, the solver tries to get the edge pieces (pieces that have two colors) in the correct position. They might do this by matching up the edge pieces with the center pieces (pieces that only have one color) on the white face.Once the edge pieces are in the correct position, the solver works on getting the corner pieces (pieces that have three colors) in the correct position. They might do this by matching up the corner pieces with the center and edge pieces on the white face.Finally, the solver uses algorithms (a set of steps to follow) to rearrange the remaining pieces so that the whole cube is solved.There are many different algorithms and techniques that people use to solve Rubik\'s Cubes quickly. Some people use a method called the Fridrich method, which involves using a series of specific algorithms to solve the cube in a particular order. Others use a method called the CFOP method, which stands for Cross, F2L (First 2 Layers), OLL (Orient Last Layer), and PLL (Permute Last Layer).To solve a Rubik\'s Cube in less than 10 seconds, a person would need to be very skilled at using these algorithms and techniques, and would also need to be able to execute them quickly and accurately.

Please explain like I'm five.","[""A hunger strike is a protest in which a person refuses to eat in order to bring attention to a particular issue or cause. People who go on hunger strikes usually stop eating solid food, but may still consume liquids such as water, juice, or other beverages in order to stay hydrated. Hunger strikes can last for a few days, or in some cases, even longer. It's important to note that hunger strikes can be very dangerous, and can lead to serious health problems, including malnutrition, weakness, dizziness, and even death. People who go on hunger strikes need to be monitored closely by medical professionals to ensure that their health does not deteriorate too much. In order to survive a hunger strike, people may have to rely on their body's reserves of energy, such as fat and muscle, to keep them going. They may also need to take supplements to ensure that they are getting enough nutrients. It's also important for people who are on hunger strikes to drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated.

For example, they might believe that the similarities between parents and their children are simply due to genetics, and that genetics works in a way that is unrelated to evolution. \nIn any case, it is important to note that the scientific theory of evolution explains these phenomena through the process of natural selection, in which certain traits are passed down from one generation to the next because they help the organisms that have them to survive and reproduce.

But in the context you are asking about , "" philosophy "" is not simply a way you do things , it is a way of organizing ideas . Some factors philosophers consider might be : * Is it more important to act on ideas our emotions push us to ? Or to act on the fact of the situation and ignore emotion ? * Is it smarter to let nature take its course , or to challenge nature ? Why , and under what conditions should you practice the opposite ? * Do ideas we act on originate from our imagination ? Or does imagination and experience create new ideas ? Or are they a circle ? * How do we know what is truth ? How do we know the facts we use to support truth are themselves true ? * Is an action or idea valuable in its own right ? Or is it necessary to reference a source outside ourselves to know what is good or right ? These are by no means the only questions . There is also the construction and testing of logical sequences . For example , is : * I always get wet | when I take a shower the same as * I am wet | therefore I must have taken a shower ? The first statement lists a condition which is true in all situations where the qualifier is present . Is the second statement also true in all conditions ?

"How do phone networks work ? Phone networks keep getting better and faster , with faster internet access on phones . Is there a limit to this ? How can we transfer so much information in a second through the air ? Explain like I'm five.","[""Phone networks work by using a series of towers and antennas to transmit and receive signals from phones. When you make a call or send a text message, your phone sends a signal to the nearest tower, which then sends the signal to the recipient's phone through another tower. The towers are connected to each other and to the phone network through a series of cables and other equipment.\n\nAs for the internet, phone networks use a similar process to transmit and receive data. When you access the internet on your phone, your phone sends a request for data to the nearest tower, which then sends the request to a computer server that stores the data you requested. The server then sends the data back to the tower, which sends it to your phone.\n\nThere is a limit to how much information can be transmitted in a second through the air, but technology is constantly improving, which means that phone networks are able to transmit more and more information in a shorter amount of time. This is why phone networks keep getting faster and faster.\n\nTo explain it simply: phone networks use towers to send and receive signals from phones, and these towers are connected to each other and to the phone network through a series of cables and other equipment. This allows us to communicate with each other and access the internet on our phones. As technology improves, phone networks are able to transmit more and more information in a shorter amount of time, which makes them faster and more efficient.""]",1
"How do phone networks work ? Phone networks keep getting better and faster , with faster internet access on phones . Is there a limit to this ? How can we transfer so much information in a second through the air ? Explain like I'm five.","[""Okay for once I am knowledgeable about a topic here . I work IT at a conference center which has me managing both data and phone networks . Now as of now I am self taught , so I am corrected , it is probably for good reason . So there are a couple limiting factors on speed when you are talking about networks , and i 'm going to try to keep this at a 5Y old level . So the stuff you want to get and the stuff you want to send from your computer are all data , which need to physically move from your computer to their intended location . Right off the bat we can see that distance is an issue , the farther away you are from your target destination the longer it will take to send data . Now we got ta pick a way to send that data . We could use literally anything , if we wanted to have the computer print out our data and make it into a paper airplane and throw it to its destination we could , but obviously that is n't very secure , nor it is fast or efficient . We could use electricity , but even the speed of electricity in wires is n't really fast enough . Now right now we are using Fiber Optic lines for much of today 's data transfer . Fiber Optic wires are made of bits of glass and can carry light across great distances . Now I doubt we are going to think of a faster medium than light any time soon , but that is n't the only factor . When you want to send data from your computer to a location like Google when you are telling it what to search for , your data needs to make it from your computer to their server . Unfortunately it is n't that easy . Data bounces in a network between intermediate servers that are like highway intersections for the Internet . Every jump is taking time to figure out which server to go to next , and that 's time you would rather have your data going to Google . On top of the server bounces , there is also no set way for data to bounce . Two signals from the same area might bounce very differently to the same location . Networks get faster when the number of bounces gets limited and better directed so that data can be better optimized . Now there are absolutely other factors , but those are really out of the scope of this post . So now when AT & T says they are on a new speed , like 4 G lte , they have better optimized those intermediate servers and they have replaced their old wires and connections with Fiber Optics . Now there is also different and better hardware that constitutes 4 G lte that I do n't know about , because getting data from a phone and moving it to a phone tower where it can then enter the system , as well as moving data from the tower to your phone is a really hard and costly process compared to the rest of the system . Anyways hopefully that answers something and that is roughly a 5th grade level . If I got anything wrong , or if anyone can clarify any of this , please call me out on it , I would rather know correct things ."", '14 Year Telecom Professional here . I have worked on wireless , optical systems , switched networks , and I had a stint as a systems / network administrator . Telephone networks depend on what you mean . There are cell phone networks , and there are land line networks , and there are data networks . While many people have transitioned away from land lines at their home , most people still use them at their jobs . Increasingly , many land - lines and cell phone signals are being run over data networks , but they still interface with the "" traditional "" phone networks and must be able to interface with those networks correctly to complete a call . In simplest terms , Cell phone networks are just a different way of taking your data / call back to the same type of systems that handle your land line calls , or cable / dsl internet at home . Wireless signal carriers do have a limit that is governed by physics on how fast the signal can transmit that signal through the air . Air is a finnicky medium , as it has things like water vapor , rain , and buildings in it . Currently , more because of the expense of upgrading data backhaul networks past the tower , the fastest is around 30 megabits per second . When you make a call from a cell phone , it has to travel back to your local tower , which then travels over a copper or fiber - optic line ( most often fiber anymore ) back to what telcom people call a switch site , and then back out over the same process in reverse to whatever phone you were calling , or whatever website you wanted to see . Now , each tower has a number of antenna , that each point in a different direction . Typically there are three in a residential area , and two on a highway site . Each one of these antenna can handle a specific number of connections , and a specific amount of data throughput . Until recently , these antenna were separate systems for calls and data , but now the newer types are allowing carriers to use the increased data throughput and better internet protocol technology to enable them to place the phone calls onto the same data stream as your internet traffic , and separate the two later . So , the limiting factors are many . The availability of fiber to each tower is actually more important currently than the ability to make a wireless signal that will go faster . The current wireless technology out there could do up to 100mbit , but it is only being utilized up to 30mbit because fiber , and the equipment to utilize it , is expensive . It is even more expensive to utilize it efficiently . Each fiber strand can carry many , many , signals on it . Each fiber cable has many of these strands , some have in excess of 700 strands , each with the ability to carry hundreds of separate signal wavelengths . These large cables are reserved for inter - city routes , as that size of cable is very expensive to install . Each one of these wavelengths of light can carry what we call an OC192 . ( Newest system is OC768 , but this is not common currently ) . Each OC192 can carry the equivalent of 10 GIGAbits of information . The systems that I work on can currently carry 160 of these OC192 signals , for a total of 160Gbits / sec of information passing through them . There are systems that can do more . If the system were natively OC768/40Gigabit , then the shelf would carry 640 Gigabits . The problem here , is that each of these systems can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars , meaning they can cost more than a reasonably price house in the midwest , per box . At minimum , you need two of these systems to even start . The current network I am working on between typing this , has roughly 1000 nodes of this type . These systems are not used for backhaul from cell phone towers . At most , because of the extreme cost , and the number of towers that need to have a drop point , an OC12 - OC48 type system , or 640mbit to 2.5Gbit . Generally , this bandwidth is shared between around 10 sites in a "" ring "" configuration . This system provides redundancy , in case the fiber is cut on any section between each tower . This will provide 64mbit / OC12 ring per site , or 250mbit / OC48 ring per site . Predictably , the cost increases as you add higher bandwidth systems that can handle entire OC192s , or multiples thereof . TLDR ; Phone networks are very expensive , and that \'s currently the largest hurdle in getting faster cell networks .', 'One huge issue is communication between the tower and the phone . There are only so many available frequencies and yet hundreds of phones . So what do carriers do ? There are multiple techniques , one of the popular ones is CDMA . CDMA is like a crowded room full of people trying to talk to each other . They all speak a different language , so while everyone is speaking at the same time , the listener ignores it as noise . By creating more and more independent languages and speaking fast , communication increases .']",0

How do photographers make the sun / moon look massive ? [ Like this ] ( URL_0 ) Explain like I'm five.,"['To make the sun or moon look larger in a photograph, the photographer can use a technique called ""forced perspective."" This involves positioning the camera in such a way that the sun or moon appears larger in relation to other objects in the scene.\n\nFor example, if the photographer wants to make the sun look larger, they might position the camera closer to the sun and farther away from other objects in the scene. This causes the sun to appear larger in the photograph because it takes up more space in the frame.\n\nAnother way to make the sun or moon look larger is to use a lens with a long focal length. A long focal length lens has a narrow field of view, which means that it zooms in on a smaller area of the scene. This can make the sun or moon appear larger in the photograph because it takes up more of the frame.\n\nFinally, the photographer can use post-processing techniques to adjust the size and position of the sun or moon in the photograph. This can involve using software to crop the photograph or to adjust the size and position of the sun or moon using tools like the clone stamp or the healing brush.\n\nOverall, making the sun or moon look larger in a photograph requires a combination of techniques, including careful camera placement, lens choice, and post-processing.']",1
How do physicists entangle particles in quantum entanglement ? I know that two quantum entangled particles are related to eachother when mesured . But how are these particles made ? Please explain like I'm five.,"['This is an excellent question and very hard to explain at an elementary school level . With that said , let \'s start off by saying that two particles are considered entangled when their correlations satisfy Bell inequalities . This does n\'t answer how to explain it without knowing what correlations or bell inequalities are , but it \'s the technical working definition . Picture two light particles separated by a very large distance , and measure their polarizations . If they \'re so far apart that light could not have gone between the two of them in the time it took you to measure their polarization , AND their is a relationship between the two polarizations , then they are entangled . So we know how to tell if they \'re entangled . So how do we actually entangle them ? One way is through quantum interference . In quantum mechanics , the "" state "" of a particle is represented by a "" wavefunction "" . Unlike an electric wave , there is nothing we know of that is actually waving . It does tell you the probability of measuring a particle or particle properties , though . Since it \'s a wave , however , it posses wave properties like interference . If a crest and trough line up , the wave amplitude goes to zero at that point . One experiment where they tested this was the "" Hong - Ou - Mandel "" experiment . They sent two identical photons in two sides of a "" beamsplitter "" ( a device which splits light 50:50 ) and measured how often the two photons came out different sides or the same side . It turns out that the path for photons to come out different sides ( since there \'s two ways for that to happen ) cancel out , and you only ever see two come out either side . The final state of the system is entangled : the two possible output states are in an equal "" superposition "" . There are other ways of entangling particles , though . Another commonly cited entanglement phenomena is in positronium ( an electron and its antiparticle orbiting each other ) . When the electron and positron ( anti - electron ) annihilate they have a certain probability to emit two photons in opposite directions with unknown but correlated polarizations . That is , when you measure the two photons they will always have polarizations at 90 degrees to each other no matter how far apart they are .', ""The simplest example I can think of is by creating two particles that are entangled when they are made . If you 're not familiar with spin , it 's a number that is a measure of angular momentum . You can think of it as just an intrinsic property of particles without actually worrying about what it means . You take a particle(s ) with spin of 0 , then turn it into two particles having spin of , say , 1 . An example might be electron - positron annihilation . If the electron has a spin of +1/2 and the positron has a spin of -1/2 , the total spin of the system is 0 . When they run into each each other they will make two photons . Each photon must have spin of +1 or -1 . There 's a law that says that the total spin of a system must be conserved , the same way energy is conserved . Because the spins have to be 0 , this forces one of the photons to be +1 and the other to be -1 , they ca n't both have the same spin . The thing is , the quantum nature of the photons mean we do n't know which one is which , furthermore , they do n't have a well defined spin until something actually measures it . Say we go in and measure one of the photons . It could be either spin , but let 's say when we measure it as +1 , this forces the second particle to be of spin -1 . If we had measured the first as -1 , the second would be +1 . The key is that neither of these particles had a well defined spin until the moment it was measured , at which point it forced the other to be the opposite direction ."", 'From what I know there are many different ways to entangle "" particles""(You got ta be carefull with that term since quantum objects can be seen as wave and particle ) . One possibility to entangle photons is per example the so called \' Spontaneous parametric down - conversion \' , where photons pass through a ( nonlinear ) crystal and have a chance to become two entangled photons with opposite polarisation . Another possibility is one or more objects that emmit two new objects , which are entangled . This can be an p.e . a molecule which gets "" destroyed "" into two atoms which are entangled or a particle and a anti - particle which \' destroy \' each other and emmit two photons .

Please explain like I'm five.,"['Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon that occurs when two particles become ""linked"" in a way that allows them to affect each other even when they are separated by large distances. In order to create entangled particles, physicists typically start by preparing two particles in a specific quantum state. \nOne way to do this is to use a process called ""pair production,"" which involves smashing together two particles with a lot of energy, such as high-energy photons or particles from a particle accelerator. When these particles collide, they can create two new particles, called ""particle-antiparticle pairs,"" which are entangled. \nAnother way to create entangled particles is to use a special type of crystal, called a ""nonlinear crystal,"" which can produce pairs of entangled photons when it is exposed to light. \nOnce the entangled particles have been created, physicists can study their behavior by measuring the properties of one particle and observing how it affects the other particle, even when the two particles are separated by large distances.

Mental disorders are conditions that can affect a person's thinking, mood, and behavior. They can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetics, environment, and life experiences.

Personality, on the other hand, refers to an individual's unique pattern of thoughts, emotions, and behaviors that make up their character. Personality is generally considered to be stable over time, but it can change somewhat as a person grows and develops. There are several ways that doctors and other healthcare professionals can differentiate between mental disorders and personality when trying to diagnose a person.

Personality traits, on the other hand, may not cause significant problems for the person or those around them.\nDuration: Mental disorders tend to be ongoing and may last for months or years, while personality traits are typically more stable over time.\nCauses: Mental disorders can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetics, brain chemistry, and life experiences. Personality traits, on the other hand, are thought to be influenced by a combination of genetics and environment.\nSymptoms: Mental disorders can cause a wide range of symptoms, including changes in mood, behavior, and thinking. Personality traits do not typically cause these kinds of changes. It is important to note that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to diagnosing mental disorders and personality traits.

"How do pilots manage to land on runways so perfectly , and not go 10 meters to the left or right and crash ? Edit : Thanks for all the great responses ! Explain like I'm five.","['FAA licensed flight instructor here ! I get excited when an ELI5 is in my wheel house . The short answer is ... practice . In calm winds , lining up with the runway \'s dashed centerline is actually one of the least challenging parts of a landing . It \'s basically not too much harder that tracking your car down the middle of the lane . Student pilots ( and experienced pilots ) tend to have much more trouble maintaining a safe and stable speed and "" glidepath "" down to the runway . Where things get tricky is when you have a crosswind . Pilots will line up with the runway in a "" crab angle . "" In this case , the nose of the plane is pointed slightly into the wind and the aircraft track slightly sideways towards the runway . It \'s like a boat going across a river . In order to go directly across , you have to point the bow slightly into the current so you do n\'t drift downstream . You do n\'t want to land sideways , so just before touchdown the pilot will point the nose straight down the runway with the rudder and then bank the wings slightly into the wind . This is called a "" sideslip "" and it ensure the plane will be pointed straight down the runway while the bank angle of the wings prevents the plane from drifting downwind . The upwind wheel will often touch before the downwind wheel . Here \'s more info .... URL_1 Most of the time pilots are landing using visual references out the cockpit window and flying by hand , even passenger jets at major airports . This is called a visual approach . It sounds kinda crude , but air traffic controllers at big airports prefer them because they can usually get more planes lined up for a runway at once , thereby increasing an airport \'s capacity . But what if you ca n\'t see the runway ? Most runways at big airports are equipped with an Instrument Landing System ( ILS ) . Basically , the pilot follows a radio signal through the clouds / fog / rain / snow down to the runway . The goal is to break out of the clouds or get close enough to the runway that you can see it and land on it . A basic ILS approach will get you down to 200 ft and 1/2mi from the runway before you have to go around and land somewhere else . Some airports are equipped with CATIII ILS approaches where you can land at almost zero visibility . URL_0 These days , GPS based approaches are becoming increasingly popular because you can create curved approach paths and the airport does n\'t have to invest in a ground - based radio signal system . As for autopilot ... it \'s very rarely used all the way down to the ground . Normally the pilots will turn it off when they drop the landing gear and fly by hand . Sometimes they might use the autopilot to intercept an ILS but then turn it off once the runway is in sight . Fully automated landings are only done in very low visibility . They require so much extra button pushing to set up that it \'s usually easier to hand fly the plane when conditions permit . * I should note that while I \'m a flight instructor , I \'m not an airline pilot and have n\'t flown any big jets . I do n\'t want to give away my job but I work pretty closely with them .', 'Airstrips are much bigger than you think . Any that land large commercial airliners are 150 - 200 ft across .

You get pretty good after a while .', ""Repitition . Do you drive and park in a garage ? If so , do you vear off and hit your side mirrors on the side of the garage often ? I 'm guessing not .

A few of my coworkers have recently gotten their pilots license ( small craft ) and numerous times during their training all they do is take off , circle , and land .

It typically occurs when natural erosion and weathering occur in an area with certain types of rock.\n\nThe first step in the process is the formation of the rock itself. Different types of rock are formed through different processes, such as the cooling and solidification of lava, the sedimentation of particles in water, or the metamorphism of existing rock.\n\nOnce the rock has formed, it is subjected to various forces that can cause it to wear away or change over time. These forces can include wind, rain, and the flow of water. As the rock is worn away, it can create openings or holes in the rock, which can eventually grow larger and become a natural arch or bridge.\n\nIn the case of a natural arch or bridge, the process is usually aided by the presence of a joint or crack in the rock, which provides a natural weak point for erosion to occur. Over time, the rock surrounding the joint or crack is worn away, leaving the arch or bridge standing on its own.\n\nI hope this helps to explain the process a little bit!

How do planes / subs know when missiles have a ' lock ' ? Or have I been watching too many movies Please explain like I'm five.,"['Missile systems generally consists of a radar to detect where the target is and send commands to the missile to tell it where to go . The radars have several modes which have their different use cases and a target can detect the signals from the radar to see what mode it is in . A radar might start out using low frequency and large sweeping scans to detect the rough placement of all planes in the sky . However this does not give accurate enough and frequent enough updates to be able to hit anything . So they change to a higher frequency radar with a more narrow sweep . This means they can only detect the airplane in the direction they aim the radar but they will be more accurate . This change of mode can be detected in the target airplane but still have to be interpreted correctly . A lot of radars had different modes of operation in peace and war so that the enemy would not be able to analyze their signals before the war .', 'I always use the flashlight analogy . Two planes trying to find each other in the sky with radar is like you and your buddy playing flashlight tag at night in pitch dark . Each plane \'s radar is normally in a "" search "" mode , where it just sweeps back and forth , searching a huge swath of sky in front of the aircraft . This is just like you , sweeping your flashlight back and forth in front of you , scanning in the dark for your friend . When your flashlight \'s beam passes over him , you can see him for a split second , before your flashlight sweeps past him and continues on . You keep sweeping your flashlight back and forth , so every few seconds , when your flashlight beam passes back over your buddy , you get another "" update "" on where he is . Now lets say you want to start chasing your friend so you can tag him ( in the context of a plane , you \'re launching a missile ) . You ca n\'t chase your friend very well when you can only see him once every few seconds as your flashlight passes over him . So you point your flashlight directly at your friend and track him with it . From your friend \'s point of view , every few seconds , he sees a flash of light from your flashlight as the beam passes over him . He knows you \'re searching for him , but he has no way of knowing if you have seen him yet . Then , your intermittent flashes of light change to a constant beam , as your turn your flashlight and point it right at him . Now , he knows you \'ve seen him , he knows that you know exactly where he is , and you are either getting ready to start chasing him , or already have . This is getting "" locked on "" . Now lets put this back into the aircraft context : A radar basically works like a giant , invisible flashlight . Each plane normally has it \'s radar in a "" scan "" or "" search "" mode , where it sweeps back and forth , scanning the whole sky for potential enemies . When it sees something ( i.e , when something bounces the light back at the radar ) the radar takes note of the position , [ puts it on a display in the cockpit for the pilot to see ] ( URL_0 ) , and continues scanning . If the pilot wants to track something ( or more importantly , try and shoot at it ) , he instructs the radar to point directly at the object it found earlier . Now , instead of sweeping around and only seeing the object intermittently , the radar points right at the target and delivers constant information on it \'s direction and speed . This is getting "" locked on "" or "" tracking "" . It \'s important to the other pilot , because like your friend playing flashlight tag , he knows when the light from your radar is hitting his aircraft . When the light switches from an intermittent ping to a constant stream , it means you are tracking him , know where he is , and either have already shot at him or are preparing to shoot . This is why getting "" locked on "" is a big deal . Edit : Now missiles . Going back to the flashlight tag analogy , let \'s say you \'re a big , heavy guy . You ca n\'t run too well or too fast , so if you tried to chase your friend yourself , he would easily run away . So , instead , you carry with you a lighter , smaller friend , who can run much faster and is much more agile than you are ( a missile ) . However , in order to run so fast , your little friend does n\'t carry his own heavy flashlight , he relies on the light from your flashlight so he can see the guy he \'s supposed to tag . So you have to keep your flashlight pointed at your target . This is Semi - Active Radar Homing ( SARH ) . In truth , I simplified the Radar system a bit in my first explanation . A radar system is not just a big , invisible flashlight , it also includes a special "" camera "" that allows you to see the light that bounces back from the target . So just like a flashlight just produces the light that allows your eyes to see your friend , the radar dish is just sending out light that the "" camera "" can then see reflected back from the target . The idea with semi - active radar homing is that in order to make our missiles as small , light , fast , and agile as possible , we do n\'t have to put a big radar dish in them , we can just put a little radar camera in them , and as long as * someone * is locked on with their radar ( the person that shot the missile , his friend in another plane , someone on the ground , etc . ) , the missile will use the light from their radar to see the target and guide itself in .', ""Warplanes can detect when they get hit by a radar pulse . When a radar system is just looking around for stuff , it will ping pretty infrequently , because it 's looking around at the whole sky . As it gets interested in something , say a plane , it will focus the area it 's looking , and be able to send more pulses to that area , which will increase the resolution and give its operators a better idea of where the object they 're looking for is . Once a missile is fired the radar , either on the ground or in the missile , will narrow down , further and further , as it wants to increase the accuracy and the refresh rate of the target , because smaller movements of the target plane become much more important to determining whether the missile hits , and become more important the nearer a the missile gets . All this means that planes receive an increasing number of radar pings and can consequently tell when the missile is getting nearer . You see this portrayed in films as pilots sitting in cockpits with increasingly frantic beeping as the missile gets nearer .""]",0

The radar system sends out a beam of radio waves, which bounces off the airplane and returns to the missile. By measuring the time it takes for the waves to bounce back, the missile can determine the distance to the airplane and use this information to guide itself towards the target.In the case of a submarine, a missile might use sonar (which is like radar but uses sound waves instead of radio waves) to detect and track the submarine. The missile sends out a pulse of sound and listens for the echoes that bounce back when the sound waves hit the submarine.I hope that helps to explain it!']",1
"How do planes fly sideways ? Surely the wind flow over the wings in that case is creating the lift in the horizontal plane , not the vertical , so why does n't it fall out of the sky ? [ Example ] ( URL_0 ) Explain like I'm five.","[""Planes are able to fly sideways by using their rudder, which is a hinged surface located at the back of the plane's tail. The pilot can use the rudder to steer the plane left or right by turning it in the desired direction. When a plane is flying straight, the air flows smoothly over the wings from front to back. This creates lift, which is the upward force that keeps the plane in the air. But when a plane is flying sideways, the air doesn't flow smoothly over the wings. Instead, it hits the wings at an angle, which changes the way the lift is generated. Instead of lifting the plane straight up, the lift acts more like a sideways force that pushes the plane in the direction it's moving. Despite this, planes are still able to fly sideways because they are designed to be stable in the air. This means that they are able to maintain their balance and stay in the air even when they are flying at strange angles or in unusual conditions. So to answer your question, planes are able to fly sideways because they are designed to be stable in the air and can use their rudder to steer in different directions.""]",1

You can do things to make it longer , to generate more lift . You can use speed and deflection and adjust the wing chord . As you turn , you will always lose lift and the vertical component drops . So , we increase our angle of attack to maintain altitude . At a 30 degree bank , we have to pull bank as well as maintain the turn to keep level . At 60 degrees bank , you feel close to or around 2 G 's continuously . As you near 90 degrees bank , the airplane would not physically or mathematically be able to increase its lift enough to fly perfectly level . It is possible to use yaw to hold onto some lift , but even that wears off . It is possible to appear level and complete a major arc at 90 degrees , losing only a small amount of altitude , but it requires significant speed . The gravity vector pulls only so much , and so long as the bank does n't exceed 90 degrees , the aircraft can use maximum lift and maximum G 's to render the gravity vector negligible for the purpose of a 5 second maneuver .

As the material in this disk cools, it begins to clump together, forming small particles that eventually grow into larger objects.

When a planet is forming, the particles are constantly smashing into each other, but they are also being pulled together by the force of gravity. This causes the particles to become more and more compact, eventually forming a sphere.\n\nThe force of gravity also helps to smooth out any bumps or unevenness on the surface of the planet, which is why planets are generally very smooth and rounded.

How do police trace bullets back to the gun they were shot from ? Or is this something you only see on tv ? Explain like I'm five. ,"['Tracing a bullet back to the gun it was shot from is a process called ""ballistic fingerprinting."" It\'s something that can be done in real life, but it\'s not as simple as it might seem on TV.\\n\\nHere\'s how it works:\\n\\nWhen a gun is fired, the bullet leaves the barrel of the gun and travels through the air. The gun also leaves behind certain markings on the bullet, called ""lands and grooves."" These markings are unique to each gun and are caused by the barrel of the gun as the bullet passes through it.\\n\\nWhen the bullet is found at a crime scene, it can be collected and sent to a laboratory for analysis.\\n\\nIn the laboratory, the bullet is examined under a microscope to look at the lands and grooves.\\n\\nThe lands and grooves are then compared to a database of known firearms to see if there is a match.\\n\\nIf there is a match, it means that the bullet was likely fired from the same gun that is in the database. This can help investigators determine which gun was used in the crime.\\n\\nIt\'s important to note that ballistic fingerprinting is not a perfect science. There are many factors that can affect the markings on a bullet, such as the type of gun, the type of ammunition, and even the environment in which the gun was fired. This means that it is possible for there to be more than one gun that matches the bullet\'s markings.\\n\\nI hope that helps to explain how ballistic fingerprinting works!

How do power plants know how much electricity to generate ? Are power plants constantly overproducing electricity to be safe ? What happens to the excess energy ? What happens if there is n't enough energy to supply the grid ? Explain like I'm five. ,"['There are many different kinds of power plants with different performance characteristics , and they \'re used in combination to ensure that the supply of electricity matches the demand as demand changes throughout the day . In one group , you have the "" base load "" power plants . These are typically things like large coal and nuclear plants that produce electricity very cheaply , but need to run at 100 % production all the time , and take a long time to turn on or off ( on the order of several hours up to several days ) . These just run at 100 % production all the time . Next you have the "" peaking "" power plants . These are typically natural gas plants that produce electricity more expensively , but can be turned on and off quite quickly ( sometimes within a few minutes ) . These are used to handle the times of highest demand , and only run for a few hours a day , if that . Finally , you have "" load following "" power plants . These are plants that can modulate their output to ensure that the right amount of power is available when it \'s needed . There are a lot of different kinds of plants that can do this , though sometimes they have to have some modifications from the standard design to allow load following operation . These are used to handle the fluctuations in demand outside of peak hours , when they \'ll be running at full output and the peaking plants will be used to produce the extra supply necessary . The grid is constantly monitoring the amount of load currently connected and feeding that information back to the power producers in order to ensure the correct amount of supply is available . Small fluctuations are handled by the grid itself : the miles and miles of power lines and other infrastructure act as a giant capacitor and can either store up excess energy when there \'s an oversupply or discharge it if there \'s an undersupply . The grid changes frequency slightly when that happens , and the grid operator tries to ensure that those frequency changes balance out so that the average frequency of the power system is consistent over the long term . If there \'s so much load that there is n\'t enough power generation supply available to satisfy it , the grid will disconnect some customers to bring things under control . The details depend on the specific legal framework and operational systems in place . In some places , large power consumers like factories or office buildings can agree to be the first ones disconnected in exchange for getting a deal on their power bills . In other places , the grid operator will impose rolling blackouts via some specific schedule . There are some other ways to do it as well .', 'The simplest and most correct answer is frequency . For the most part power plants turn physical energy into electricity via a generator or turbine , so lets talk about how that works first . In both cases there is a rotating object inside of a circular case and some wire . Typically the wire is attached to the part that does n\'t move and looped in specific patterns , and the rotating part can have magnets or it \'s own specially placed wires . When rotation happens the changes in magnetic fields cause electricity , or in this case better called current , in the wires . The power that comes to your house is "" AC "" which means Alternating current . That means that unlike a battery the electricity changes direction over time , this happens very fast , about 50 to 60 times every second depending on the country you live in . In order to create electricity that does that the generator or turbine needs to spin at a specific speed , that speed depends on the wires inside but for ease of thinking about it lets imagine that it must rotate once all the way around per full cycle of AC . Now lets think about something else for a second , riding a bike . When you ride your bike on a nice flat road you can go a certain speed , but when you climb a hill you ca n\'t go that fast anymore . The demand of trying to climb the hill is too much for you to do at the same speed , so your bike slows down and you need to put in more effort to keep moving . Electrical generators are very similar , when there is more demand ( usually called load ) it takes more energy to turn the generator at the same speed , so at first the generator starts to slow down . If the power plant can supply more energy to the generator , for example the turbine at a dam could have it \'s valve opened more allowing more water to turn it , then it will speed back up and everything is good . Now , lets imagine everyone goes to make a cup of tea or hot chocolate all at the same time so a whole bunch of stoves and kettles and microwaves all get turned on . Well now all of the generators start slowing down as they no longer turn as easy ( just like a bike going up hill ) and the people that run the various power stations can see that the frequency is going down . As a response to this power plants that can react faster either by supplying more energy to their generators , or turning some on that were previously off , start doing that and provide more power to the power grid . As more power is supplied all of the generators start spinning a little faster . It takes less effort to turn so since they are mostly still being turned as hard they go faster , like when you finally get to the top of a hill . Now what happens when everyone is done making a hot drink ? All of the generators now turn a little too easily , and the people running the power plants can see the frequency going too high so certain power plants might turn off generators or reduce power going to them . Some modern power stations and solar can be more complicated than that , but they still try to emulate that behavior . As far as how which power stations know when to do what , that comes down to agreements between the various power stations and the types of stations .', 'good answers so far in a local scope , but there are also a series of ISOs ( and RTOs ) that help manage the power at the grid scale . These organizations collect data points from many different power plants , and points across the grid , and help all those power companies in their footprints to determine which power plants to turn on and off , and to help schedule out the next day or so with things like maintenance , predicted demand , transmission constraints , etc all factored in .

Explain like I'm five. ,"['Power plants are designed to generate a certain amount of electricity to meet the demand for electricity from homes and businesses in a particular area.

Instead, they try to produce the right amount of electricity to meet the current demand. If there is more electricity being produced than is needed, the excess electricity is often sent back into the grid for other people to use.\\n\\nIf there is not enough electricity to supply the grid, power plants may try to increase their production of electricity to meet the demand. If they are unable to do this, the grid may experience a power outage, which means that the electricity supply is temporarily shut off until the problem can be fixed.']",1

"How do processed foods increase the risk of cancer ? In other words , how do foods cause uncontrollable mutation of cells ? Explain like I'm five. ","['The uncontrollable mutation of cells is a result of something damaging the DNA of cells . All sorts of things can damage their DNA , including chemicals you ingest or inhale . The claim that processed foods increase the risk of cancer is likely because they are more likely to have preservatives or other chemicals as a result of how the food was made and prepared . If these chemicals do in fact damage DNA when a cell absorbs them , then they are likely to increase your risk of cancer .', 'The mechanisms for how chemicals can increase the risk of cancer is very interesting ! First let ’s quickly go over the genetics of cancer . We have at two categories of genes that are involved in cancer : oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes . Oncogenes are naturally there for cell division ( for healing wounds and growing and such ) . However , if a mutation occurs in an oncogene , this can result in uncontrolled growth and division of the cell . Meanwhile , tumor suppressor genes are there to STOP or mediate cell division and growth . Mutation of a tumor suppressor gene is usually recessive ( you would need the gene on both copies of the chromosome to be mutated for it to have an effect ) , however , this can also lead to uncontrolled growth . Now , the way these chemicals can increase our risk of cancer is by increasing the chance of mutations in our DNA . Mutations occur when there is a mistake in our DNA when the cell divides ( because the DNA has to be replicated , so those mistakes will be passed on to the daughter cells ) . This can be cause by DNA damage . The chemicals may have certain groups of atoms that are particularly dangerous . For example , the chemical may introduce “ free radicals ” . Free radicals are single electrons that wreak havoc in their path to find a partner . This can damage our DNA . When our molecular machines repair our DNA it is another opportunity for a mistake to happen . If this mistake is n’t caught by the time the cell divides , well , you should get it by now haha . All it takes is a mutation in an oncogene to lead to a tumor . Also , certain chemicals are not harmful to us until our own enzymes metabolize them . The reason why we metabolize them is so that we can change the molecules into a form that can dissolve in water ( so we can pee it out ) . Otherwise , an “ oil and water ” effect will occur and we will never be able to pee out the chemical . However , these water - soluble forms or their intermediates ( the forms in between their oil - soluble and water - soluble forms ) may end up being carcinogenic ( increase the risk of cancer ) . Not all processed foods increase the risk of cancer . It ’s a factor of studying the various chemical preservatives they use in the food .', 'I \'m no expert by any means , but there \'s a book "" the metabolic approach to cancer "" that relates cancer back to mitochondrial malfunction which then causes problems in DNA . Processed foods might affect mitochondria , but I \'m not that far into the book . It \'s a great read and actually cites sources giving it much more credibility than many other non fiction books .']",0

The actors can then be filmed in front of the green screen, and the digital image of the empty city can be added in later during post-production (editing) to make it look like they are really in an empty city. Another way to film empty streets is to actually go to a location that is naturally empty, such as very early in the morning before people are out and about, or to a location that is not heavily populated. The crew can then film the actors in these naturally empty locations and use special effects to remove any people or cars that might accidentally be caught on camera.

If you \'re doing a lock - off shot ( i.e. , no camera movement ) , you could shoot a street with cars and people moving normally , and just let the camera run for a while . Then you can build up an empty frame by stepping through the footage frame by frame and taking different parts of the frame where there are no cars or people . So , in frame 1 , car is at point a , but by frame 10 , it \'s moved onto point b. Use a bit of frame 10 to cover up point a in frame 1 . For parked cars and other elements that do n\'t move and need to be removed , you either clone bits of nearby elements ( walls , street , etc . ) , or you use bits from photographs that you took while on set from different angles , where you could see the bits of the buildings behind the parked cars . If the camera is moving , it gets a little more tricky , but the principle is still the same . You still create an empty plate by combining the techniques I \'ve described above , but then you have to track that frame to match the camera movement .

Here\'s a simple explanation of how it works:\r\n\r\nFirst, the program needs to be ""trained"" on lots of examples of handwriting. This means showing it many different handwritten characters and telling it what they are supposed to spell.\r\n\r\nThe program uses this training data to learn patterns in the way different characters are written. For example, it might notice that the character ""爱"" is usually written with a certain stroke order and certain shapes.\r\n\r\nWhen you write a character and show it to the program, it looks at the shapes and strokes you used to write it.

How do protesters have time to protest for days on end ? Do n't these people have jobs or other responsibilities that require their attention ? Explain like I'm five.,"[""Protesters are people who take time out of their regular schedules to attend protests and speak out about something they feel strongly about. Some protesters may have jobs or other responsibilities, but they are able to make time to attend the protest by taking time off work or rearranging their schedules.

They ca n't stand around forever . Please explain like I'm five.","['Protests can have an effect on lawmakers and decision-makers in a variety of ways. Here are a few possibilities: \n1. Attention: When a large group of people come together to protest, it can draw the attention of the media, lawmakers, and the general public. This attention can help to raise awareness of the issue being protested and put pressure on decision-makers to address it. \n2. Public opinion: Protests can also influence public opinion on an issue. When people see others expressing strong feelings about an issue, it can make them more likely to support the cause as well. This can create a groundswell of public support that lawmakers may feel compelled to respond to. \n3. Voter pressure: If a protest movement is successful in rallying a large number of people to its cause, it can put pressure on lawmakers to address the issue in order to win the support of those voters. \n4. Direct action: In some cases, protests may involve more than just standing around. They may involve sit-ins, strikes, boycotts, or other forms of direct action that disrupt business as usual and make it more difficult for decision-makers to ignore the issue. \n5. Negotiations: Finally, protests can sometimes lead to negotiations between the protesters and decision-makers. This can provide an opportunity for both sides to come to an agreement and find a solution to the issue at hand. \nOverall, the effectiveness of a protest depends on a variety of factors, including the size of the protest, the level of public support for the cause, the strategies used by the protesters, and the willingness of decision-makers to engage with them.']",1
How do public-company buyouts work?,"[""A public company buyout, also known as a merger or acquisition, is a transaction in which one company buys the assets or ownership stakes of another company. This can be done through a variety of methods, including cash payments, stock swaps, or a combination of both.There are several steps involved in a public company buyout:Offer: The acquiring company makes an offer to purchase the target company. This offer can be made publicly or privately, depending on the size and complexity of the transaction.Negotiation: The acquiring and target companies negotiate the terms of the deal, including the price, financing, and any other conditions.Due diligence: The acquiring company conducts due diligence to ensure that the target company is a good fit and that there are no major issues or liabilities that could affect the deal.Approval: The deal must be approved by the boards of directors of both companies and, in some cases, by the shareholders of both companies.Closing: If the deal is approved, the transaction is completed and the acquiring company takes ownership of the target company.It's important to note that public company buyouts can be complex and involve a variety of legal and financial considerations. It is often advisable to seek the guidance of legal and financial professionals to ensure that the transaction is handled smoothly and efficiently.""]",1
How do public-company buyouts work?,"['As a TL;DR version of JAGAnalyst\'s excellent answer: the buying company doesn\'t need every last share; all they need is to get 51% of the voting bloc to agree to the merger, and to vote that way at a shareholder meeting. Or, if they can get a supermajority (90% in the US), they don\'t even need a vote. Usually, a buying company\'s first option is a ""friendly merger""; they approach the board of directors (or the direct owners of a private company) and make a ""tender offer"" to buy the company by purchasing their controlling interest. The board, if they find the offer attractive enough, will agree, and usually their support (or the outright sale of shares) will get the company the 51% they need. Failing the first option, the buying company\'s next strategy is to make the same tender offer on the open market. This must be a public declaration and there must be time for the market to absorb the news before the company can begin purchasing shares on the open market. The goal is to acquire 51% of the total shares in existence. Not 51% of market cap; that\'s the number (or value) of shares offered for public trading. You could buy 100% of Facebook\'s market cap and not be anywhere close to a majority holding (Zuckerberg himself owns 51% of the company, and other VCs still have closely-held shares not available for public trading). That means that a company that doesn\'t have 51% of its shares on the open market is pretty much un-buyable without getting at least some of those private shareholders to cash out. But, that\'s actually pretty rare; some of your larger multinationals may have as little as 10% of their equity in the hands of the upper management who would be trying to resist such a takeover. At this point, the company being bought is probably treating this as a ""hostile takeover"". They have options, such as: However, for companies that are at risk of a takeover, unless management still controls enough of the company that an overruling public stockholder decision would have to be unanimous, the shareholder voting body will often reject efforts to activate these measures, because the takeover is often viewed as a good thing for them; if the company\'s vulnerable, that\'s usually because it has under-performing profits (or losses), which depresses its stock prices, and the buying company will typically make a tender offer well above the current stock value. Should the buying company succeed in approving the merger, any ""holdouts"" who did not want the merger to occur and did not sell their stock are ""squeezed out""; their shares are forcibly purchased at the tender price, or exchanged for equivalent stock in the buying company (nobody deals in paper certificates anymore, and as of the dissolution of the purchased company\'s AOI such certs would be worthless), and they either move forward as shareholders in the new company or take their cash and go home.']",0

How do racoons and other creatures carry rabies without dying / going extinct ?

While rabies is a serious and often fatal disease, not all animals that are infected with the virus will become sick or die from it. This is because some animals are able to develop immunity to the virus and are able to survive the infection.Rabies is a virus that affects the central nervous system of animals. It is most commonly transmitted through the bite of an infected animal, but it can also be transmitted through scratches or abrasions. When an animal is bitten by another animal that has rabies, the virus can be transmitted through the saliva of the infected animal and enter the body of the animal that was bitten.Once the virus enters the body, it begins to multiply and spread to other parts of the body, including the brain and spinal cord. This can cause symptoms such as fever, weakness, and difficulty swallowing. If left untreated, rabies can be fatal.However, not all animals that are infected with rabies will develop symptoms or die from the disease.

How do railguns work ? I would like some clarity on the act of actual projectile being fired . Please explain like I'm five.,"[""Sure! A railgun is a type of gun that uses electricity to launch a projectile instead of gunpowder. It works by using two metal rails and a sliding armature to create a strong magnetic field. \nFirst, a very strong electrical current is passed through the rails. This creates a magnetic field that pushes against the armature, which is a conductive metal bar or rod that is mounted between the rails. When the magnetic field is strong enough, it can overcome the force of gravity and friction, causing the armature to slide along the rails at high speed. \nThe armature is connected to the projectile, which is a small metal object that is meant to be launched from the gun. As the armature slides along the rails, it carries the projectile with it, propelling it out of the railgun and through the air. \nThat's the basic idea, but there are a lot of technical details and engineering challenges involved in making a railgun work properly. Some railguns use additional components, such as a pulsed power supply or a plasma armature, to achieve even higher speeds and greater accuracy. \nI hope that helps!

In it simplest for , it 's a conductive metal ball or slug . When the gun is fired , current flows through the hunk of metal and it is pushed out as others have described . This method is rather primitive though . The large amount of friction , on top of the heating from the current , cause both the projectile and rails to heat of immensely which can damage the rails giving them a short lifetime . As well , this forces you to use copper or aluminum for the projectile , as you want as high as conductivity as possible , but this is counter productive to making a good weapon . More advanced railgun projectiles , like those that are actually being tested for military purposes , are a little more complex than a piece of metal stick between the rails . Firstly , the actual projectile does n't actually touch the rails nor is it mean to carry the current . It 's a dense metal , like tungsten or depleted uranium , shaped like a dart which makes for deadly projectile even at very long ranges that can peirce pretty much anything . The actual projectile is incased in what is known as a sabot . This is a little casing that surrounds it that fits the rail gun barrel .

How do really expensive HDMI cables work better than cheap ones ? Is it not all ones and zeros ? example 1 [ expensive ] ( URL_1 ) example 2 [ cheap ] ( URL_0 ) Explain like I'm five.,"['HDMI cables are used to transmit video and audio signals from one device to another, such as from a DVD player to a TV. The cables work by sending digital data, which is made up of a series of ones and zeros, from one device to another. The difference between expensive and cheap HDMI cables is the quality of the materials used and the construction of the cable. Expensive HDMI cables are often made with higher-quality materials, such as gold-plated connectors, which can help to improve the signal quality and reduce interference. They may also be made with thicker, more durable cables and have better shielding, which can help to reduce the risk of signal loss or interference. On the other hand, cheap HDMI cables may be made with lower-quality materials and may not have as good of shielding or durability. This can result in a lower-quality signal and a greater risk of interference or signal loss. In general, it is important to use a good-quality HDMI cable to ensure that you are getting the best possible signal quality.

How do refrigerators work ? How does the cooling process work ? What 's going on at the back in that little tank ? Explain like I'm five.,"[""Sure!

As the alcohol evaporates , it absorbs the heat on the surface of your skin , making your skin cooler . This is essentially the same process as your refrigerator . A special coolant known as a refrigerant functions in a refrigerator the way that the rubbing alcohol works on your skin , except in a refrigerator , the coolant is trapped inside a series of coils . As the refrigerant travels through this circuit , it changes from being a liquid to gas and back again . In order to do this the refrigerator needs 4 main components , * Compressor * Heat exchange pipes inside and outside ( Ones you can see at the back of the refrigerator ) * Expansion valve * Refrigerant Say for example the refrigerant is ammonia in a gaseous form ( Boils at -27 degrees F ) the compressor will suprisingly compress the gas , which then heats up . The coils at the back of your refrigerator let the gas dissipate its heat , which will then condense into a liquid . This high pressure liquid will flow through the expansion valve , essentially a small hole with high pressure ammonia liquid and on the other an area of low pressure as the compressor is sucking gas out that side .

This heat is released on the back side of the fridge where the tube is welded to a metal structure which helps getting rid of all that heat . After that the now compressed coolant flows into the fridge and a valve reduces the pressure . Just like a sponge which is compressed the coolant "" soaks up "" heat inside the fridge ( again , the coolant tube makes a few turns and there is a metal structure attached , so a large amount of heat can be transferred ) . The coolant now is pumped to the compressor and the cycle begins again . All of these processes happen at the same time : when the compressor runs , a portion of the coolant is compressed while the other part soaks up heat in the fridge . Note : You can observe the process in the fridge somewhere else : When you take a can of deodorant and spray for a longer time ( do it outside of the house ) , the can will get a little bit cold on the bottom .

How do sail boats go faster than the wind ? The Americas Cup sailboats can go nearly 2 times windspeed . How do they go faster than the wind is blowing them ? Please explain like I'm five.,"[""They are actually sailing parallel to the wind and/or upwind , which is not with the flow of the wind . The sails act like a wing , creating lift which is counteracted by the keel to result in forward motion . Since they are sailing into the wind , they never outrun the wind , instead as they go faster , the apparent wind speed increases . Sailing straight downwind ( with the wind ) , you ca n't go faster than the wind ."", 'The common way that a lot of people think of a sail is as if it were a big parachute . With this conceptualization you have a big sheet of cloth and the wind pushes it from behind . This kind of sailboat can only go as fast as the wind pushes it . However , that \'s the wrong mental picture . The goal of a sail is actually to get the wind to move along the sail , like the air moves over the wing of an aircraft . Just as an aircraft gets lift from its wings a sailboat gets "" lift "" from its sail , but that "" lift "" is directed forward instead of up . This approach does not limit the speed of the boat to the speed of the wind . It even allows the boat to sail nearly directly upwind .', 'There are two basic ways a sail can drive a boat onward . 1 . If the wind is coming from behind , or at not too big an angle behind , the boat , then the sail is trimmed ( basically , aimed ) so that the wind fills the sail from behind . The wind pushes the boat along , as you \'d expect . If the boat were to reach the speed of the wind , any further increase in the boat \'s speed would cause the wind to start pushing it * back * . So , in that configuration , the boat ca n\'t go faster than the wind . 2 . Once the wind is more than about 45 degrees off from the stern ( rear ) of the boat , though , the sail is trimmed such that the * front edge * of the sail is pointing into the wind . The wind is now flowing * along * the sail on both sides of it . As the boat turns further and further towards the wind , the sail gets pulled in further and further , so that its front edge is aimed into the wind and the wind is flowing along both sides . This works until the boat is heading about 45 degrees upwind - that is , the wind is coming in at a 45 degree angle off the bow ( front ) of the boat . How the sail works in this case , I \'ll explain a bit further down . 3 . When the boat is pointing closer than 45 degrees into the wind , that will stop working . You can no longer get the right sail shape , and the wind will just push against the boat and slow it down and eventually stop it . So the people in other comments saying you can sail almost directly upwind are mistaken . You ca n\'t practically sail very close to directly upwind , you have to be a significant angle off . This is why , when boats are trying to get directly upwind , you \'ll see the zigzag , and you \'ll notice each zig and zag is approximately a 90 degree turn - because they \'re close to 45 degrees off the wind in one direction , and then the other , as they work their way upwind . So , how does the sail work when the boat is pointing somewhere between about 45 degrees upwind and 45 degrees downwind ? It \'s all about the shape of the sail . Imagine yourself looking down on the boat from directly above the mast . The wind is blowing the sail into a sort of billow form . If it could , the wind would blow the sail all the way straight in whatever direction the wind is going , like a flag , but it ca n\'t . A sail is not like a flag in a very important way - the bottom of it is attached to a big straight bar , called the boom . So the sail must stay straight at the bottom , all the way to the rear corner . But , and this is just as important , the sail is n\'t a plain flat triangle either . It has a bunch of extra fabric ; it \'s bigger in the middle than is needed to fill the space between the lines if it were just flat . So there \'s extra material to billow out , and the wind , trying to blow the sail off to the side , turns it into a curve . Because of the shape of the sail and how much extra material is in which parts , the sail forms a shape with a sharper ballooning out right at the front , and a shallower curve towards the rear . If you \'re looking at this from above , this shape looks very much like what the cross - section of an airplane wing looks like from the side . It works in the same way . I \'m not going to fully ELI5 how that works right here , but the simplest way to imagine it is that the wind creates * suction * on the rear side of the sail . Think of it like this , sort of : Along the inside of the sail \'s curve , the side in the direction the wind is coming from , the wind is directly hitting the sail and being curved by it . So here , the wind is partly pushing against the sail . But on the outside of the sail \'s curve , the side away from the direction the wind is coming from , the wind going past the mast would just keep on moving past where the sail is , except that direction of motion of the air would pull some air away from the sail . It causes the wind to curve in towards the sail after it has passed it , but it \'s not actually blowing against the sail , it \'s still blowing kind of away from the sail . It \'s pulling air away from the sail . It \'s creating a kind of suction , sucking the sail in that direction . It \'s pulling the sail towards the direction in which it \'s billowing . Now , you might \'ve noticing , looking down at the boat from above , that this direction the wind is sucking the sail towards is n\'t actually directly towards the front of the boat . And you \'re right - if the boat were flat on the bottom , it would start sliding partly sideways , partly forward . But sailboats have something called a keel ( if it \'s permanently fixed ) or centerboard ( if it \'s made to slide into and out of the water ) , which sticks out from the bottom of the boat deep into the water . This keel is a thing but wide blade shape that allows the boat to easily slide forward or backward , but presents a lot of resistance against sliding sideways . So all of the sideways component of the force coming from the sail gets wasted pushing water against the side of the keel / centerboard , but the forward component of the force from the sail moves the boat forward . Even though the boat is actually being pushed at an angle sideways - forward , it only moves forward . Now here \'s the most important part for answering your question : This motion of the wind along the sail on both sides , creating a force that sucks the sail towards where it \'s billowing ... this force is going to keep on being there as long as the wind is flowing along the sail . It does n\'t matter how fast the boat is moving . This force is stronger when the wind is faster , and this force weakens when the wind is slower , but this force is not affected at all by how fast the boat is moving ! It \'s the same amount of suction - force on a boat standing still , or on a boat slowly , or a boat moving fast . If the boat happens to be moving at a speed that happens to be higher than the speed of the wind ? So what ? There \'s no relationship , per se , between the speed of the wind and the speed of the boat in that sense . The only relationship is that the speed of the wind determines how much suction - force acceleration is being applied to the boat . In theory , this could eventually accelerate the boat to "" infinite "" speed ( well , eventually relativity and speed of light limitations start to matter :) , as long as the wind kept flowing along the sides of the sail like that . It does n\'t , of course , because there \'s drag on the boat . That is , resistance to its forward motion , mainly from the water , though somewhat from air too . For any specific amount of forward suction - force , there \'s a maximum speed it can get the boat to , where the amount of force from water and air resistance is equal to amount of forward force from the sail \'s suction , and the boat stops getting any faster . Obviously , the stronger the wind , the faster the boat can go before reaching that point , because the stronger the wind , the stronger the suction - force from the sail . But the point is , that maximum speed is * not * determined by a comparison of the boat \'s speed and the wind \'s speed . Rather , it \'s determined by the relationship between the amount of suction - force you can get from that particular size & shape of sail at whatever the current speed of the wind is , vs. the amount of resistance on the boat ( determined by its mass and design ) . Of course skill matters too , because the boat wo n\'t actually get the true maximum force from the sail . How close it is to the maximum possible , depends on how well the sailors trim the sail to just the right point , and keep up with changes in wind direction , with a combination of subtly steering the boat and moving the sail in or out .']",0

The box will not move as easily as the paper because it is much heavier and more difficult to push. \nSailboats work in a similar way. The wind pushes against the sails, but the boat is much heavier than the paper, so it doesn't move as easily.

"How do satellites stay with the earth 's orbit with out being pulled back down to the ground ? Talked about satellites and orbit in physics today , and sparked this question . Thanks in advance ! Please explain like I'm five.","[""Sure! A satellite stays in orbit around the Earth because it is constantly falling towards the Earth due to gravity, but it is also moving very fast horizontally. This combination of falling and moving horizontally means that the satellite follows a curved path around the Earth. Imagine you are standing on a hill and you roll a ball down the hill. The ball will roll down the hill and then continue rolling across the flat ground. If you give the ball a big enough push, it will keep rolling and rolling without stopping. This is similar to how a satellite stays in orbit around the Earth.

If the Earth was not pulling on the satellite or it \'s moving too fast , it would be launched into space . If the satellite is moving too slowly it \'s pulled down . It \'s the balance between centripetal force and centrifugal force that keeps the satellite in orbit . The velocity or "" speed "" of the satellite is achieved when the satellite is launched and left to maintain its own course once it is in the correct location .

"How do schools justify limiting free speech ? I know there have been tons of supreme court cases with students suing their schools because they violate free speech , but the schools always win . How do they keep winning ? Explain like I'm five.","['There are several reasons why schools may limit free speech, and these limits are generally considered to be acceptable under the law. First, it\'s important to understand that the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects the right to free speech, but this protection is not absolute. The Supreme Court has recognized that there are certain circumstances where the government (including schools, which are a part of the government) can regulate or limit speech without violating the First Amendment. One of these circumstances is when the speech in question causes a ""substantial disruption"" to the operation of the school. For example, if a student makes a speech during class that is so disruptive that it interferes with other students\' ability to learn, the school may be justified in limiting that speech. Another reason why schools may limit free speech is to ensure that all students have an equal opportunity to learn. For example, if a student is making racist or sexist comments that are disrupting the classroom environment and making it difficult for other students to focus, the school may be justified in limiting that speech. Finally, schools also have a responsibility to maintain a safe and orderly environment. If a student\'s speech is threatening or violent, the school may be justified in limiting that speech in order to protect the safety of other students. So, to summarize, schools can limit free speech if the speech causes a substantial disruption to the operation of the school, if it interferes with other students\' ability to learn, or if it threatens the safety of the school community.']",1

If you do this , you will be promptly arrested , searched by dogs , and the school will be evacuated .

These rocks can be picked up and directly studied to determine base properties for rocks , and they can be compared all over the world to get a general idea of the type of rocks that come from specific forming events . Next up is Seismic data . Effectively we hit the world really hard and see what happens . Of course , short of nuclear devices we can not produce the energy that natural earthquakes can ( but we are now discovering that we can make earthquakes more likely with various things we do ) . We understand very well how waves travel in solid and liquid mediums , how that relates to the properties of the medium and what the waves do when they hit edges or transition zones . It 's the transitions that are interesting , because it 's from earthquakes being recorded at measuring stations on the other side of the world that we saw things that could only happen if the centre of the planet was a liquid . That was almost as mindblowing at the time as the theory that the Earth 's surface could in fact move . The next easiest one is gravity . The Earth has an average gravity , but the gravity in a specific area depends on how far you are away from the centre and what 's in between the centre and you . Rocks under mountains or under the ocean are denser and result in higher gravities . Rocks carrying heavy elements such as gold , lead , practically everything else worth money , are denser and have more gravity . So by measuring the gravity over lots of points on the Earth 's surface we can work out the differences between the material underneath that point . For fun we can measure the change in gravity over time , which occasionally comes up with bizarre results , like Greenland is getting lighter . The ice cap is melting with the higher average temperatures taking weight off the island which then results in the whole island rising out of the sea by a few centimetres . After those two , things get weird . Induced Polarisation is the use of large electric currents through the Earth to determine the conductivity and capacitance of rocks . Only good for the first 700 m , but really good at determining what is within that depth . Magnetics uses the Earth 's magnetic field and measures very small area changes in it . These occur largely because of conductive masses within the Earth , and by watching the differences as you move you can work out where the conductive section is . The existence of the magnetic field itself tells us about the inside of the planet , because we must have a moving electric field to create the magnetic field . More interesting is evidence from rocks in places where the crust is splitting open that the magnetic field is not stable , but varies in strength and can in fact reverse direction . Ground penetrating radar uses reflections from radio waves to determine where things are under the ground . Good for fairly shallow things only but can tell you precise depth and location . Then we get to the various radioactive measures , which use the presence of radioactive elements , their relative quantities and their distribution to determine how the rocks were formed . Most useful for surface features and the top layer of soil over the rocks . Many of these techniques can be applied to other celestial bodies .

By studying these meteorites, they can learn about the chemical and physical properties of celestial bodies, including their cores. Overall, scientists use a combination of observations, experiments, and calculations to learn about the cores of celestial bodies, even if they can't physically dig into them.""]",1

"How do scientists seperate particles from the rest of their groupings ?

","['There are many ways that scientists can separate particles from their groupings, depending on the specific type of particles and the properties they have. Here are a few examples:\\n\\nFiltering: This method involves using a filter or sieve to separate particles based on size. For example, if you wanted to separate sand from pebbles, you could use a filter with small holes that only allow the sand to pass through, while the pebbles are too big to fit through the holes and stay on the other side.\\n\\nCentrifuging: This method involves using a machine called a centrifuge to spin a sample at high speeds. The particles in the sample will be separated based on their weight and density, with the heavier particles settling to the bottom and the lighter particles remaining at the top.\\n\\nMagnetic separation: This method involves using a magnet to attract and separate particles that are magnetic from those that are not. For example, if you had a mixture of iron filings and sand, you could use a magnet to pull out the iron filings and leave the sand behind.\\n\\nChromatography: This method involves separating particles based on their chemical properties. Scientists can use different techniques, such as paper chromatography or column chromatography, to separate different substances from a mixture.\\n\\nIn the ""Gold Foil Experiment,"" scientists used a method called alpha particle scattering to separate particles. They shot alpha particles (which are made up of two protons and two neutrons) at a thin sheet of gold foil and measured how the particles were deflected or absorbed. By analyzing the data, they were able to learn more about the structure of atoms.']",1

How do scientists split atoms ? I still do n't get it . How does one actually get something that can cut an atom ? Explain like I'm five. ,"['Splitting atoms is a process called nuclear fission. It happens when a neutron hits the nucleus of an atom and causes it to break apart into two smaller atoms. This releases a lot of energy, which is why nuclear fission is used to generate electricity in power plants.\\n\\nTo split atoms, scientists use special machines called reactors. These reactors use uranium or plutonium as fuel. When the atoms in the fuel are hit with neutrons, they split and release energy. This energy is used to heat water, which makes steam. The steam turns a turbine, which generates electricity.\\n\\nScientists can also split atoms using another process called nuclear fusion. In this process, two lighter atoms are combined to make a heavier atom, releasing a lot of energy in the process. However, nuclear fusion is much harder to do than nuclear fission, and scientists are still working on finding a way to use it as a practical source of energy.']",1

But in the best case , the book has an index in the back , which makes it easy ; you find "" rose "" in the index , and it tells you which of the pages in the book talk about roses . How did the book \'s index get made ? Well , some people went through every page in the whole book and wrote down what topics are mentioned in which page . They might have used one index card for each topic ; as they went through the book , when they found a page that talks about roses , they took the index card for "" rose "" and added that page number to it .

When people feel sexually aroused, their bodies automatically start to do certain things in response. For example, men might get an erection, and women might experience vaginal wetness. These reactions are controlled by the nervous system, which is a part of the body that helps us feel things and respond to them. The nervous system sends signals to different parts of the body, telling them what to do. So when someone is sexually aroused, their nervous system sends signals to their genital area, which causes the body to prepare for sexual activity.

How do share buybacks work?,"['The short version of JB King\'s excellent answer is that the company will typically buy back shares from the open market at market price. Sometimes, it will specifically target larger stakeholders, even controlling interests, who are making noise that they want to divest; if such an investor were to just dump their stock on the open market, neither the investor nor the company would be very happy with the resulting price collapse. In those cases, the company may offer an incentive price above market rates. In recent times, the investor looking to divest has often been the U.S. Government, who received stock in return for bailouts, and (with notable exceptions) turned a modest profit on many of them. Not enough to break even on the entire bailout, but the Government didn\'t just throw $700 billion in taxpayer money down a hole as conservative pundits would have you believe. In the \'80s, a specific type of buy-back was made famous, called the ""leveraged buyout"". Basically, the company took out a huge loan against itself, and used that money to buy up all the company\'s publicly-traded shares, essentially becoming a private company. This became a popular tool among private equity groups, for better and worse.']",0
How do share buybacks work?,"['A share buyback, also known as a stock buyback, is when a company repurchases its own outstanding shares from the market. This reduces the number of shares that are available for trading, and can increase the value of the remaining shares. There are several reasons why a company might choose to buy back its own shares.One reason is to increase the value of the remaining shares. When a company buys back its own shares, it is effectively saying that it believes the shares are undervalued. This can lead to an increase in the price of the remaining shares, as investors may see the buyback as a sign of confidence in the company.Another reason is to return value to shareholders. If a company has a large amount of cash on hand and no good investment opportunities, it may choose to buy back its own shares as a way to return some of that cash to shareholders. This can be an attractive option for shareholders, as they can receive a cash payout without having to sell their shares.There are several ways that a company can buy back its own shares. The most common method is to conduct a tender offer, in which the company offers to buy a certain number of shares at a fixed price. Shareholders can choose to sell their shares back to the company or hold onto them. Alternatively, the company can buy shares on the open market through a process known as open market repurchases.It is important to note that share buybacks can be controversial, as some people believe that they can be used by companies to manipulate their stock price or to avoid paying dividends. However, if done for the right reasons, share buybacks can be a legitimate way for companies to return value to shareholders and to address imbalances in their capital structure.', ""A share buyback, also known as a stock buyback, is a way for a company to repurchase its own outstanding shares from the open market. The company typically does this to reduce the number of shares outstanding, which can increase the value of the remaining shares by lowering the supply. Share buybacks can also be used to return capital to shareholders, or to make strategic acquisitions.There are several ways that a company can execute a share buyback. One method is through an open market purchase, where the company buys back its shares on the open market through a broker. Another method is through a tender offer, where the company offers to buy back a specific number of shares at a predetermined price.Share buybacks can be funded through the company's cash reserves, or through the issuance of debt or additional shares. The specific details of a share buyback, including the number of shares to be repurchased, the price, and the funding source, are usually announced in a press release or Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing.It's important to note that share buybacks are not the same as dividend payments, which are a distribution of the company's profits to shareholders. Share buybacks can have a similar effect of returning capital to shareholders, but they do not involve the distribution of the company's profits.""]",1
How do share dilution scams make money?,"[""!Share dilution scams are fraudulent schemes that involve the issuance of new shares of a company's stock, often without the knowledge or approval of the company's legitimate shareholders. The goal of these scams is typically to raise funds for the scammer, either by selling the new shares to unsuspecting investors or by using the proceeds from the sale of the new shares for personal gain.Here's how a share dilution scam might work:The scammer establishes a fake company or acquires control of a legitimate but struggling company.The scammer issues a large number of new shares of the company's stock, often through an initial public offering (IPO) or other means.The scammer then sells the new shares to investors, often at a discounted price to make them more attractive.The scammer pockets the proceeds from the sale of the new shares, either for personal gain or to fund other fraudulent activities.As the number of outstanding shares increases, the value of each individual share decreases, diluting the value of the stock held by the legitimate shareholders.Share dilution scams can be difficult to detect, as the scammer often goes to great lengths to create a legitimate-looking company and marketing materials. It's important for investors to do their due diligence before investing in any company, including researching the company's financials and management team and seeking the advice of a financial advisor.This content may violate our content policy. If you believe this to be in error, please submit your feedback — your input will aid our research in this area."", ""Share dilution scams often involve the sale of new shares in a company at a price that is significantly lower than the current market price of the company's shares. The scammer will typically use various tactics to promote the sale of the new shares, such as making false or misleading statements about the company's financial performance or prospects for future growth.Once investors have purchased the new shares, the scammer will often sell their own shares in the company, which will dilute the value of the new shares that the investors have purchased. This can result in a significant loss for the investors, while the scammer will profit from the sale of their own shares.Share dilution scams can also involve the use of insider information to manipulate the price of the company's shares. For example, the scammer may make false or misleading statements about the company's financial performance in order to manipulate the market price of the shares and then sell their own shares at the inflated price.It is important for investors to be cautious and to thoroughly research any investment opportunity before committing their money. It is also a good idea to consult with a financial advisor or professional before making any investment decisions.""]",1
How do share dilution scams make money?,"['For this to work, those who control the dilution must also control their salaries because the only way for them to be paid off when it\'s the corporation itself selling is to gain access to the proceeds. When a corporation sells newly issued equity, the corporation itself owns the money.  To at least have the appearance of propriety, the scammers must be paid those proceeds.  Both actions imply that the board is captured by the scammers. There are many corporations that seem to do this even with persistently large market capitalizations. The key difference between this and pump-and-dump is that its a fraudulent group of investors selling in this case instead of the corporation itself. A detailed simple example Corporations are mandated by law to be little oligarchies; although, ""republic"" is now becoming more appropriate with all of the new shareholder rights.  A corporation is controlled at root by the board of directors who are elected by the shareholders.  The board has no direct operational control, as that is left to the ""king"", the CEO; however, the board does control what everyone wants access to: the money. Board members have all sorts of legal qualitative mandates on how to behave, and they\'ve functioned fairly decently efficiently over the long run, but there are definitely some bad apples. Boards are somewhat intransigent since it\'s difficult to hold board elections, and usually only specific board members are put up for election by a shareholder vote, so a bad one has the potential to really get stuck in there.  Once a bad one is in there, they don\'t care because they know it will be tough to get them out, so they run roughshod over the company\'s purse. Only the board can take action on major funding such as the CEO\'s operating budget, board compensation, financing, investment, etc, some with shareholder approval, some without.  The corporation itself owns all of those assets, but the board controls them. In this example, they scheme with most likely the top executive, but a rubber stamp top executive could allow a lower rung to scheme with the board, but the board is always constant until the law is changed. Because there\'s no honor amongst thieves, the board votes which can require some combination of executive and shareholder approval are taken very close together: sell shares, increase salaries to key executive schemers, increase board compensation.  The trusting shareholders believe this is in the best interests of the company at large so go along. So the money flows from existing & new shareholders to the corporation now controlled by a malicious board and then finally to the necessary malicious executive and the vital malicious board.']",0

While humans need to sleep in order to rest and restore their bodies, fish and sharks do not have the same kind of sleep-wake cycle.

Digg was a lot like reddit , with user submitted content and up and down votes to determine exposure ( IIRC anyway , obviously been a while ) . Digg was a fantastically popular website in its heyday , and generated tons of traffic . However , they went the way of Icarus and flew too close to the sun . They were n\'t content with their advertising revenue , and started curating sponsored posts in exchange for money . This led to Digg deleting posts , changing content , and hiding submissions , since the companies paying did n\'t want their brand associated with anything controversial . It turned very much into a "" walled garden , "" and word about the new fangled Reddit quickly spread through comment sections and internet forums . Unfortunately , this seems to be a natural life cycle . The last few years have seen Reddit adopt a similar business model ( just google "" Online Reputation Management "" and see how many companies are in this business now ) . A few examples from just the last 12 months would be the Rick & Morty viral marketing campaign , the McDonald \'s Szechuan sauce campaign , tons of The_Donald , and lots of the Resist / Left Wing / Bernie stuff everywhere . The entire Tiny Trumps sub is the best example . Go back and look at some of the original posts on the sub , the user accounts are usually several years old , but only began posting in 2016 , and all political . [ This Forbes article ] ( URL_0 ) goes into greater detail about it . Political astroturfing is nothing new , and both sides are guilty of it . Unfortunately their tug of war over Reddit has a great chance of eventually collapsing the platform . The long and short of it is basically websites featuring user driven content are cool . People like and use them . Companies that specialize in "" online reputation management "" create thousands of accounts and leave them dormant for months . When the site reaches a certain level of popularity , these reputation management companies are hired for viral advertising . This becomes standard practice until the bigger content creators no longer use the platform . Disaffected users eventually find each other through forums and comment sections , and the next big website is born . It develops through its infancy , and is eventually sucked back into the web of viral astroturfing . The platform is destroyed , users flee , and the Phoenix is reborn .', 'The Reddit foundes have been pretty open about the fact that their submot form had one extra field : nickname . They basically spent all day posting content and comments as different users to set the vibe they wanted the site to have . So when actual users came , it already felt like an active place . Oh and there were no subreddits as to not fragment the fledgling user base too soon .']",0

How do skydivers calculate where they 're going to land ? After watching Luke Aikins ' free fall I 'm curious as to how skydivers calculate their landing . Please explain like I'm five.,"['Skydivers use a combination of factors to calculate where they will land, including the wind speed and direction at different altitudes, the height of the jump, and the position of their body relative to the ground.To calculate their landing, skydivers will first check the weather forecast to get an idea of the wind conditions at different altitudes. They will also use a device called a ""variometer"" to measure their rate of descent and the wind speed and direction while they are in the air.Skydivers can control their speed and direction by changing the position of their body. For example, they can spread out their arms and legs to slow down, or tuck their arms and legs in to speed up.When a skydiver is getting close to the ground, they will also look for landmarks on the ground, such as roads, buildings, or fields, to help them gauge their distance from the ground and make any necessary adjustments to their position.Finally, skydivers use a parachute to slow their descent and help them land safely. The parachute is opened at a specific altitude, and the skydiver steers it towards their desired landing spot using cords attached to the canopy.']",1

One way to do this is by using a crane with a wrecking ball. The crane would swing the wrecking ball into the building to knock out chunks of concrete and steel. Another way to take down a skyscraper is by using a machine called a hydraulic excavator, which has a long arm with a big bucket on the end. The operator of the excavator would use the arm to grab onto pieces of the building and pull them off.Regardless of the method used, it is important to be very careful when demolishing a skyscraper, especially if there are other buildings close by.

Customers who are looking for healthier or more high-quality food might choose the small restaurant over McDonald's.\r\n\r\nAnother way that small businesses can compete is by offering a more personalized experience. For example, a small fast food restaurant might get to know their regular customers and offer them special deals or personalized service. This can make the small business feel like a more welcoming and friendly place to eat, which can be a big advantage over a big chain restaurant.\r\n\r\nFinally, small businesses can also try to compete by being more convenient or easier to access than big businesses. For example, a small fast food restaurant might be located in a part of town where there aren't any big chain restaurants, so it's the only option for people in that area.

How do small cap stocks perform vs. large cap stocks (like Dow constituents) during bear trends?,"[""In general, small cap stocks tend to be more volatile and may underperform large cap stocks during bear markets. This is because small cap companies typically have less financial resources and a smaller market capitalization, which can make them more vulnerable to economic downturns. They may also have less diversification in their business operations, which can make them more susceptible to industry-specific challenges.However, it's important to note that the performance of small cap stocks relative to large cap stocks can vary significantly depending on the specific circumstances of the bear market and the individual characteristics of the companies involved. Some small cap stocks may perform relatively well during a bear market, while others may underperform.It's also worth noting that bear markets are typically characterized by a broad-based decline in the stock market, so it's not uncommon for both small cap and large cap stocks to experience declines during these periods. In general, it can be helpful to diversify your portfolio by including a mix of small cap, mid cap, and large cap stocks to help manage risk and potentially improve your overall returns over the long term.""]",1
How do small cap stocks perform vs. large cap stocks (like Dow constituents) during bear trends?,"[""To a certain extent, small cap companies will in general follow the same trends as large cap companies. The extent of this cointegration depends on numerous factors, but a prime reason is the presence of systemic risk, i.e. the risk to the entire market. In simple terms, sthis is the risk that your portfolio will approach asymptotically as you increase its diversification, and it's why hedging is also important.  That being said, small cap businesses will, in general, likely do worse than large cap stocks, for several reasons. This was/is certainly the case in the Great Recession.  Small cap businesses have, on average, higher betas, which is a measure of a company's risk compared to the overall market. This means that small cap companies, on average outperform large cap companies during boom times, but it also means that they suffer more on average during bear times. The debate over whether or not the standard beta is still useful for small cap companies continues, however. Some economists feel that small cap companies are better measured against the Russell 2000 or similar indexes instead of the S&P 500.  Small cap companies may face problems accessing or maintaining access to lines of credit. During the Great Recession, major lenders decreased their lending to small businesses, which might make it harder for them to weather the storm.  On a related point, small businesses might not have as large an asset base to use as collateral for loans in bad times. One notable large cap company that used its asset base to their advantage was Ford, which gave banks partial ownership of its factories during hard times. This a) gave Ford a good amount of cash with which to continue their short-term operations, and b) gave the banks a vested interest in keeping Ford's lines of credit open. Ford struggled, but it never faced the financial problems of GM and Chrysler.  Despite political rhetoric about Main Street vs. Wall Street, small businesses don't receive as much government aid in times of crisis as some large cap companies do. For example, the Small Business Lending Fund, a brilliant but poorly implemented idea in 2010, allocated less than $30 billion to small businesses. (The actual amount loaned was considerably less). Compare that to the amounts loaned out under TARP. Discussions about corporate lobbying power aside, small businesses aren't as crucial to the overall stability of the financial system Small businesses don't always have the manpower to keep up with changes in regulation. When the Dodd-Frank Act passed, large banks (as an example), could hire more staff to understand it and adapt to it relatively easily; small banks, however, don't always have the resources to invest in such efforts.  There are other reasons, some of which are industry-specific, but these are some of the basic ones.  If you want visual confirmation that small cap businesses follow a similar trend, here is a graph of the Russell 2000 and S&P 500 indexes:  Here is a similar graph for the Russell 2000 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average.   If you wanted to confirm this technically and control for the numerous complicated factors (overlap between indexes, systemic risk, seasonal adjustment, etc.), just ask and I'll try to run some numbers on it when I have a chance. Keep in mind, too, that looking at a pretty picture is no substitute for rigorous financial econometrics. A basic start would be to look at the correlation between the indexes, which I calculate as 0.9133 and 0.9526, respectively. As you can see, they're pretty close. Once again, however, the reality is more complicated technically, and a sufficiently detailed analysis is beyond my capabilities. Just a quick side note. These graphs show the logarithm of the values of the indexes, which is a common statistical nuance that is used when comparing time series with radically different magnitudes but similar trends.  S&P500 and Russell 2000 data came from Yahoo! Finance, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average data came from Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) Per usual, I try to provide code whenever possible, if I used it. Here is the Stata code I used to generate the graphs above. This code assumes the presence of russell2000.csv and sp500.csv, downloaded from Yahoo! Finance, and DJIA.csv, downloaded from FRED, in the current directory.  Fidelity published an article  on the subject that you might find interesting, and Seeking Alpha has several pieces related to small-cap vs. large-cap returns that might be worth a read too.""]",0

This motion is similar to the way a person might crawl on their hands and knees, but without the use of hands or knees.\n\nSome snakes, like rattlesnakes, also have a special adaptation called a rattle on the end of their tail.

How do snipers avoid being detected from their muzzle flash ? Especially at night .

There are a few ways that they can do this:\n\nUse a suppressor: A suppressor, also known as a ""silencer,"" is a device that is attached to the end of a gun\'s barrel. It helps to reduce the amount of noise and flash that is produced when the gun is fired.\n\nUse special ammunition: Some types of ammunition produce less flash when they are fired. Snipers can use this type of ammo to help reduce the amount of flash that is visible.\n\nShoot from a covered position: If a sniper is shooting from a covered position, such as from inside a building or behind a tree, the flash from their gun may be less visible to their enemies.\n\nShoot at a distance: The further away the sniper is from their target, the less visible the flash from their gun will be. This is because the light from the flash will become less intense as it travels through the air.\n\nUse night vision equipment: Many snipers use night vision equipment, such as goggles or scopes, to help them see in low light conditions. This can help them to see their targets without the need for a muzzle flash.\n\nI hope this helps to explain things! Let me know if you have any other questions.']",1

How do soccer players curve the parabolic trajectory of the soccer sphere ? Scratch that : ELI4 Please explain like I'm five.,"[""To curve the ball in soccer, a player kicks the ball with the inside of their foot (the part closest to their other foot) and applies spin to the ball. This makes the ball spin around its center as it moves through the air. Because the ball is spinning, the air flows differently over one side of the ball compared to the other. This difference in airflow causes the ball to curve, or bend, in the direction of the spin. Just like a spinning top, the ball will lean towards the direction it is spinning in. Another way to curve the ball is to kick it with the outside of the foot (the part furthest away from the other foot). This also causes the ball to spin, but in the opposite direction. Kicking the ball with the outside of the foot will cause it to curve in the opposite direction of the spin. It takes a lot of practice and skill to be able to kick the ball with the right amount of spin and force to make it curve the way you want it to.

So the controller chip translates between what the PC \'s operating system may expect , thinking it is talking to a hard disc drive , into the memory organization that is actually there in the SSD . The controller chip also does some other functions to help maximize reliability and throughput on the SSD . The big advantage of an SSD is speed . Writes are a bit slower than reads , but both are much faster than on a hard disc . On a hard disc , the read / write head may have to wait 10 \'s or even 100 \'s of milliseconds for the data track / sector it wants , since the head has to move in and out and wait for the proper sector to spin around to it . Since SSDs use integrated circuits , their access times are on the order of 1000 times faster . An SSD should also be more resistant to mechanical shocks , since there is nothing moving inside at all . Of course , they are n\'t indestructible . One thing to know about SSDs that is n\'t obvious : They slow down as they fill up . Data can be written to an empty SSD faster than one that is nearly full , because the controller chip has to do a lot of "" housekeeping "" when the memory is getting full .

This combination is then accessed whenever you are trying to open something that is saved on it . Perhaps a quick example would help explain this : Lets say you are trying to save a picture onto an empty SSD . Let 's all assume that all the switches in the empty drive are open / off , meaning the are n't working . You save the picture , and the solid state drive connects to 5 switches , which are all connected to a main path switch , and turns them all on . It then deactivates the main path to those 5 switches , but those 5 switches stay turned on . They currently are n't working , but the switch configuration is set in the drive . When you try to open up the picture later , it reconnects that main path switch , those other 5 switches start working , and it opens up the picture ."", 'Trying to put the "" five "" into the ELI5 ...

Changes in pronunciation over time: The way words are pronounced can change over time, especially if the word is borrowed from another language. For example, the word ""colonel"" was borrowed from French, and it used to be pronounced with a ""k"" sound at the beginning, like it is spelled. However, over time, the pronunciation changed to a ""k"" sound at the beginning. Differences in regional accents: People in different parts of the world or even different parts of a country may pronounce words differently due to their regional accents.

Some of these systems use chemical reactions to produce a force, while others use electricity or radiation. \nOne type of propulsion system that is commonly used on space probes is called a rocket engine.

Here\'s how it works: A rocket engine has a fuel, like gasoline or rocket fuel, and an oxidizer, which is a chemical that helps the fuel burn. When the fuel and oxidizer are mixed together and ignited, they create a chemical reaction that produces a lot of hot gas. This hot gas shoots out of the back of the rocket engine at high speeds, and it\'s this gas that propels the rocket forward. As the gas shoots out of the back of the rocket, the rocket is pushed in the opposite direction, just like how a balloon fills with air and floats up into the sky when you let go of it. The force that pushes the rocket forward is called the ""thrust"" of the rocket engine.

The movement of the diaphragm creates changes in air pressure, which are then detected by our ears as sound.\n\nThe size of the speaker and its diaphragm can affect the types of sounds it can produce. Larger speakers and diaphragms can generally produce lower frequency sounds, such as bass, more easily because they have more mass and can move more air.

How do speakers generate sound ? Subquestion : why is it that smaller heaphones usually ca n't product strong bass sounds compared to bigger speakers ? Explain like I'm five.,"['What we know as sound is our response to pressure waves in the air around us . The frequency ( how close together ) and amplitude ( the size ) of these waves make different sounds . A speaker creates pressure waves by moving a cone back and forth . By moving at different speeds and over different distances , it creates waves of specific frequencies and amplitude . The cone of the speaker has a magnet attached to it . Near that magnet inside the speaker housing is a coil of wire . When electricity is run through the coil of wire the magnet gets pulled toward the coil . When the electricity in the coil stops , the magnet springs away from the coil due to the shape of the speaker cone . Running electricity through the coil at differing frequencies and for differing durations cause the speaker cone to move sound waves at various frequencies and amplitudes . Headphones usually have very small speaker cones and very small magnets . Because of this , they are usually not very good at creating low frequency sound waves .', 'Sound is the result of vibrations . Everything we touch is surrounded by air . Take your cat for instance . He is surrounded by air . If he wants to move , he has to push the air out of the way to make room for himself . So if the cat swishes his tail once , his tail will push air out of the way to make room . The air will also rush to take the place where his tail used to be . Now instead of all of the air in the room immediately rearranging to make room for the cat \'s new position , the air closest to the cat \'s tail is going to get squeezed together like a spring while most of the air stays still . But then the compressed air needs to spread out again , so it \'s going to push more air out of the way in order to expand . Now the air near the cat \'s tail is spread out again , but we have more compressed air further away that also needs to expand and it \'s going to push more air out of the way . This is called a compression wave and it will keep moving around the room until all of the air in the room is spread out as evenly as possible . Now imagine the cat is really wagging its tail . This is a form of vibration . The cat \'s tail is going to create a compression wave each time it moves . If it is wagging fast enough , you might have multiple compression waves in the air at the same time . If his tail is wagging REALLY fast , the compression waves get really close together , and if he is wagging more slowly , the compression waves get further apart . The speed of the wagging - the speed of vibration - is called "" frequency "" and the distance between compression waves is called "" wavelength "" . When those compression waves from the tail reach our ear drums , it vibrates our ear drums at the same frequency as the cat \'s tail . That vibration is channeled from our ear drums into our inner ear where nerve cells interpret the vibrations as "" electrical "" signals to our brain . If the cat \'s tail was vibrating fast enough and pushing enough air around , our brain would receive the signal from the vibrations and interpret the signal as sound . When the frequency is high , we hear high pitch noises from things like flutes or tweeters , and when the frequency is low , we hear low pitch noises from objects like bass drums and subwoofers . A microphone works in a similar way to our ears and brain - the compression waves from the cat \'s tail move a diaphragm ( a slim layer of material similar to our ear drums ) and the diaphragm vibrates at the same speed as our cat \'s tail . The diaphragm is connected to a coiled wire , so when the diaphragm moves , the coil moves with it . When you move the coil over a magnet , it creates electricity , which we use as an electrical signal to represent the sound . A speaker works like a microphone in reverse - there \'s a diaphragm and a magnet and a coil . But in this case , we send the electrical signal back to the coil where it creates a magnetic field and pushes or pulls against the magnet . Since the coil is pushing and pulling it starts moving and since the diaphragm is attached , the diaphragm moves with it . So now the diaphragm is moving at the same speed as the original sound from the cat \'s tail , creating compression waves that are VERY similar to the original compression waves from the cat \'s tail . The reason small headphones ca n\'t produce lots of strong bass is because of the size of the speakers . Every time the speaker moves , it moves a certain amount of air . The amount of air a speaker can move is determined by the diameter of the speaker and the distance it can travel ( excursion ) . As a sound gets lower in frequency , we have to move more air to hear it at the same volume . So high frequencies can be played by speakers with small diameters and tiny excursions ( 1 inch tweeter with half a millimeter excursion ) , whereas low frequencies need to be played by large speakers with large excursions ( 8 inch woofer with half inch excursion ) .', 'Speakers generate sound by vibrating a diaphragm which in turn makes vibrations in the air . Bass is difficult because it requires slower vibrations which must move more air to maintain equal volume . This generally requires a larger diaphragm and more power , both of which are in short supply for headphones .']",0
"How do speakers make more than one frequency at a time ?please !

If you throw in a pebble into still water , there will be a simple ripple pattern of a certain frequency . If you throw in that pebble and another anywhere next to it , they will each make their own ripples which will then crash into one another and make a more complex ripple . This is the superimposed frequency . Our minds are able to deconstruct this complexity into its component fundamental frequencies even if you are unaware , and as such , when speaker cones vibrate they vibrate according to this complex waveform which we then hear as sound composed of many different frequencies ,', ""If I understand correctly , speakers use the superposition principle . Basically , waves can move through one another and overlap . When waves overlap , they pretty much just add together like you 'd expect them to : peaks add together to become taller , and overlapping peaks and troughs level out . When a speaker simulates a complex sound , it really just plays the result of superimposing the individual frequencies ."", 'A drum is a vibrating surface that makes a sound with a lot of frequencies . If you look at the waveform of a drum , it is not a sine wave but very complex . To reproduce the drum sound the complex waveform is played through a loudspeaker and the speaker cone follows the complex shape of the waveform to produce the various frequencies . The same is true for other sound sources . Edit : you can produce two frequencies with you hand . First , wave you hand with quick small movements . Now while still doing that move your hand up and down slowly . Imagine waving at someone who is bungy jumping past you . The small fast movements and the slow up and down movements are two frequencies and you are making at the same time .']",0

Any simple explanations for me ? Explain like I'm five.","[""Sure! A speaker is able to produce multiple frequencies at the same time by vibrating its cone in different ways. The cone is attached to a coil of wire called a voice coil, which is suspended in a magnetic field. When an electrical current is passed through the voice coil, it creates a magnetic field that interacts with the magnetic field of the speaker. This causes the voice coil to move back and forth, causing the cone to vibrate.\n\nThe cone of the speaker is made of a flexible material, such as paper or plastic, and it is shaped like a cone. When it vibrates, it pushes and pulls the air around it, creating sound waves that travel through the air to our ears.\n\nThe pitch of the sound produced by a speaker is determined by how fast the cone is vibrating. Different frequencies correspond to different pitches, so to produce multiple frequencies at the same time, the speaker needs to vibrate its cone at different speeds. This is done by sending different electrical signals to the voice coil, which cause it to move at different speeds and produce different frequencies.\n\nSo, in summary, a speaker is able to produce multiple frequencies at the same time by vibrating its cone in different ways, using different electrical signals to control the voice coil and alter the speed of the cone's vibration. I hope this helps to explain the concept! Let me know if you have any other questions.""]",1
How do speakers of tonal languages figure out the words in songs ? I was thinking about this today ... is it all context ? Edit : thanks for answering this everyone ! ! ! Explain like I'm five.,"['In tonal languages, the pitch of a syllable can change the meaning of a word. For example, in Mandarin Chinese, the word ""ma"" can mean mother, scold, hemp, or horse, depending on the tone in which it is spoken. When listening to a song in a tonal language, speakers of that language use the context of the lyrics and the melody to figure out which words are being sung. They also use their knowledge of the grammar and vocabulary of the language to help them understand the meaning of the words in the song.\n\nFor example, if a Mandarin speaker is listening to a song and hears the word ""ma"" being sung with a high, level tone, they might guess that the word means ""mother"" because this is a common meaning of the word ""ma"" when it is spoken with this tone. If the context of the song makes it clear that the singer is talking about their mother, then the listener can be more confident that they have guessed the correct meaning of the word.\n\nIt is also common for tonal languages to have written transcriptions of songs that show the correct tones for each syllable, which can help speakers understand the words in the song more easily.\n\nOverall, understanding the words in a song in a tonal language involves using context, knowledge of the language, and, if available, written transcriptions to figure out the meaning of the words.']",1

How do speakers virtually produce any sound ? From my understanding speakers are made up of some vibrating cone of a fixed shape . It just seems to me that such a thing could only produce one sound like a drum . Explain like I'm five.,"['It \'s the * way in which it vibrates * that counts . Different sounds are made from different pitches and amplitudes . Pitch is determined by how fast the speaker vibrates , and amplitude is determined by how "" hard "" it vibrates . When your computer pumps music to your speakers , it is really pumping a voltage waveform . This waveform represents the sound of the music ( it \'s what the music looks like on the computer , with the wavy lines ) . The waveform represents different sounds with changes in frequency ( pitch ) and amplitude ( loudness ) . Now , inside the speaker is the cone , a solenoid ( solenoids turn into magnets when current runs through them ) and a permanent magnet . When a voltage is applied to the solenoid , it becomes a magnet , the solenoid and permanent magnet move each other , and the cone ( attached to the solenoid ) moves . In fact , if you wanted , the computer could send a signal to the speaker that would make it move the cone once , then hold this position . Whatever voltage waveform is pumped to the speaker , the speaker will move accordingly . So , for example , if the voltage waveform is a perfect sine wave , the speaker cone will move like a sign wave . Incidentally , this movement will cause the air surrounding the cone to move in a sine wave and produce a single pitch . In the whole process , the music waveform is converted to a voltage waveform , which electromagnetically moves the cone in the same waveform , reproducing the sound . So , by changing the frequency of the voltage waveform , you change how fast the speaker vibrates and change the pitch ( i.e the sound ) made by the speaker .', 'Your * [ eardrum ] ( URL_0 ) * is a thin membrane that translates the sound emanating from * any * source into the audible sensations you hear .

For example, a small speaker with a thin, lightweight diaphragm might be good at producing high-pitched sounds, like a tweet or a chirp, while a larger speaker with a heavier diaphragm might be better at producing lower-pitched sounds, like a bass drum or a bass guitar. By using different combinations of speakers, an audio system can produce a wide range of sounds, from deep bass to sparkling highs.']",1

How do student loans contribute to the rising price of higher education ? ? Explain like I'm five.,"[""\\nStudent loans are a way for people to borrow money to pay for their education. When students take out loans to pay for college, they are borrowing money that they will need to pay back later, with interest.

This is because students are willing to pay more for their education, even if it means taking out loans to do so. If students weren't able to take out loans, they might not be able to afford to pay the higher prices, and colleges and universities might have to lower their prices in order to attract students.\\n\\nSecond, the rising price of higher education can also contribute to the increasing amount of student loan debt. As the price of college goes up, students have to borrow more money to pay for their education. This can lead to a cycle where the price of college continues to increase, and students have to take out even more loans to pay for it.\\n\\nOverall, student loans can contribute to the rising price of higher education by making it easier for colleges and universities to increase their prices, and by leading to a cycle where the price of college continues to increase as students have to borrow more money to pay for it.""]",1

Why not just seal up the basement to prevent water from coming in ? Explain like I'm five.,"['A sump pump is a device that is used to remove water that has accumulated in a sump pit, which is a small hole or depression in the floor of a basement or crawl space. When water enters the sump pit, the sump pump turns on and pumps the water out of the pit and away from the building.\n\nSump pumps are used for a number of reasons. One of the main reasons is to prevent basements from flooding. When it rains or when there is a lot of melting snow, the ground can become saturated with water. This can cause the water table to rise, which can cause water to seep into the basement through cracks in the foundation or through other openings.\n\nSump pumps are also used to prevent basements from becoming damp or moldy. Water that accumulates in the basement can create a humid environment, which can lead to the growth of mold and other harmful bacteria. Sump pumps help to keep the basement dry by removing excess water.\n\nIt is not always possible to completely seal a basement to prevent water from coming in. Even if a basement is sealed, it is still possible for water to find its way in through cracks in the foundation or other openings. Sump pumps provide a way to remove water that does enter the basement, so it is not necessary to completely seal the basement in order to keep it dry.']",1

The body ’s complex processes that keep our skin free from infection are the same ones that allow ink to live forever in our skin . It should very difficult for anything to stay in the skin : humans shed about 40,000 skin cells per hour , or around 1,000,000 per day . Anything drawn onto the skin would gradually flake or get washed off .

They do that by pushing small needles over and over , quickly , pushing the ink deep into the fibers of the dermis . Pushing so far into the skin is essentially a wound , and the body reacts as you ’d expect it to . The immune system reacts to what it considers to be an attack by sending cells to the wound and start repairing the skin — that process might sound traumatic , but it ’s actually what allows tattoos to stick around for so long . The cells , known as macrophages , travel to the site of the wound and start eating up the ink that has been deposited there . Other cells and parts of the skin , such as fibroblasts , suck up the tattoo ink . But they ca n’t do anything with it , and so stay stuck in that layer , visible through the skin . Some of the ink will go into the upper layer of the skin , and that will then be shed as normal . That ’s why the process of getting a tattoo also includes time letting your skin heal , with the body taking two to four weeks to initially heal .

The dermis contains blood vessels, nerve endings, and connective tissue, and it is much thicker and more stable than the epidermis. The cells in the dermis are not replaced as quickly as the cells in the epidermis, which are constantly being shed and replaced. This is why tattoos do not disappear when the cells in the epidermis are replaced every 7 years or so.However, tattoos can fade over time due to a variety of factors, such as exposure to sunlight, skin trauma, and the natural aging process. The ink in a tattoo can also be broken down by the body's immune system, which can cause the tattoo to fade or become distorted.

That bracket gave you $ 0 in taxes and accounted for $ 10k of your income . You still have $ 35k left , so you look at the next bracket . It takes up to $ 15k of your income , and that portion of the income is taxed at 10 % , so it adds $ 1,500 to your taxes . You still have $ 20k left , so you look at the next bracket . That takes all your remaining income and taxes it at 30 % , giving you another $ 6,000 in taxes . That handles all your income , so you just sum up the amount of tax from each bracket -- $ 0 + $ 1,500 + $ 6,000 → $ 7,500 total . There are other types of tax , but that 's probably the one you 're talking about ."", 'For the US : 1 . You estimate how much tax you will owe when starting a job . This will mainly be based on whether you have any dependents ( such as children ) . Your job will give you a form to fill out that does this for you . 2 . That estimated tax gets deducted from each paycheck and sent to the federal , state , and local governments . Once per year , you file a tax return : 1 . Your job will mail you your tax information , called W-2 forms . 2 . Figure out your total tax liability ( how much you owe the government ) 2 . Figure out how much tax credit you get ( how much the government owes you ) 3 . Subtract the credit from the liability to find out how much tax you should actually be paying . 4 . Compare the tax you actually owe to the estimated tax that was withheld in Step 2 . 5 . Figure out whether you underpaid or overpaid over the course of the year . If you underpaid , you owe the government more money . If you overpaid , you get a refund . 6 . Repeat for both state and local . Protip : [ Just use software to do it for you . ] ( URL_0 ) It \'ll ask you stuff like , "" Are you married ? "" or "" Did you buy a house this year ? "" or "" What does your W-2 say in box 3 ? "" and you just fill in the answers and hit "" submit . ""', 'I \'m going to assume you mean taxes as in income tax / the frenzy people get into about "" tax day "" ( normally on / around April 15th ) and "" tax return / refund "" that you hear people talking about . So here \'s the deal , baring some exceptions , every dollar you earn at a job is taxed . When you started working you might have been asked to fill out several forms , one of which might have asked you things like "" how many dependents do you have . "" Then it gives you a very rough ( and usually very bad , more on this later ) estimate of how much federal income tax you \'ll owe for the working year . So let \'s say it says "" we estimate you should withhold 15 % of your wages for taxes "" and you say fine . Now , your paycheck is 15 % less , but the important thing is you have n\'t lost any money . That 15 % that they take -- it \'s still there , it \'s still yours , you just do n\'t have it * now * . ( In a real paycheck there would be other deductions taken off too : social security , local taxes , etc . ) Now around February - April , most people will * * file * * their federal taxes . This is nothing more than filling out a few pages of documentation to let the government know how much money you earned , so they can figure out how much money you need to pay . So you \'ll typically get some forms from your job around this time called the W2 that lists how much money you \'ve earned , how much you \'ve paid in taxes , and how much you \'ve withheld for taxes . Let \'s say that the gross salary is 50k over the course of the year . Gross means absolute total , before any taxes etc were taken out . This is the theoretical amount you \'d have earned if you did n\'t pay taxes , pay social security , etc . The US federal income tax system is one called a "" progressive tax "" system . Another tax system you might have heard in the news is called a "" flat tax "" system , which is also known as a "" regressive tax "" system . The flat / regressive tax system is simple to understand : you pay the same percentage of taxes no matter your income . So if the flat tax was say 10 % , then your 50k income means you pay $ 5000 , and someone \'s 500k income means they would theoretically pay 50k . This is n\'t actually a good thing because imagine a person earning 20k / year gross : for him paying $ 2000 in taxes is a huge amount of money leaving him with less to spend for necessities . For that rich guy making 200k , he \'d pay 20k , which is the entire income of the poor guy , but he still has 180k left to spend on things like "" food "" and "" housing . "" Sales tax is a form of a regressive tax because poor people pay the same in taxes for that chicken that needs to feed his family for the entire week , whereas for a rich person the measly dollar or two in sales tax for the chicken is literally pocket change . Back to the income tax / progressive tax . The system is split into several brackets . I do n\'t recall them off the top of my head , but let \'s say the following are the brackets : * From $ 0 to $ 30000 you pay 0 % taxes * From $ 30001 to $ 50000 you pay 20 % taxes * From $ 50001 to $ 100k you pay 30 % taxes * Etc So back to your 50k gross income : this means that the money you earn up to 30k will * * always * * be taxed at 0 % . It does n\'t matter if you make 50k , 25k , 500k . The first 30k will always be 0 % . The money you earned between 30k and 50k are now taxed at 20 % , always and forever . So you do some math : you have $ 20000 left untaxed , and on that 20k ( and * * only * * on that 20k ) you will pay 20 % on taxes . The total amount you owe is just added up from all the brackets . This is important to understand because every now and then you \'ll hear conservative talking points like "" I was given a raise which pushed me into the next tax bracket and now I take home less money because I pay more in taxes ! "" which is 100 % factually incorrect . Even if you were "" pushed into the next tax bracket "" , the only additional taxes you would pay is the amount in only that next tax bracket , so unless that next tax bracket had a tax percent over 100 % then it is impossible to pay so much more in taxes that you take home less money , due to income tax . Now when you do your taxes you might also hear people talking about "" deductions "" . What are these ? These are ways to make your income look "" less "" so that you pay less taxes overall . Remember that your gross income was 50k . If you support yourself ( ie , your parents do n\'t claim to support you ) then you are allowed to take a personal deduction . Let \'s say this deduction is worth $ 5000 . You subtract it from your gross income to get your "" adjusted taxable wage "" , which would be 45k in this example . This would now lower your tax burden : the first 30k is still taxed at 0 % , but now you only need to pay 20 % on 15k for the next bracket , instead of 20 % on the original 20k . There are quite a few ways to lower your tax burden . Donating to charity for example would lower it . I think you get a tax credit if you bought an electric car , so that lowers your taxable wage as well . I think first time home buyers get a credit as well . If you deposit money directly from your salary into a retirement plan ( IRA , 401k , etc ) then it lowers your taxable wages as well . Ok , so you now have figured out how much money you owe the federal government in income taxes . How do you pay it ? Well actually , you \'ve already essentially been paying it . Remember that federal withholding we talked about ? That \'s money that has been set aside ( withheld ) from your paycheck to be used to pay federal income taxes . So after one year of working , let \'s say they have withheld a total amount of 10k from your wages , and now you figure out you only need to pay 5k in taxes . You fill out your forms and give the IRS a bank account for them to deposit the remaining 5k into . A couple weeks later you get a huge 5k "" bonus "" and you \'re happy and go out and buy a brand new car with this "" free money . "" Only that \'s not free money . That \'s money that you actually earned . That \'s money that you told the government to withhold for you to pay taxes with , but that extra amount you get back means that he government has withheld too much money and are just giving it back to you . This money was just sitting there this entire time , earning no interest for you , not letting you access it to buy things , etc . The best way is to actually sit down and do the math to figure out how much you \'ll need to pay , and tell them to withhold as close to that amount as possible , but this is a much harder subject to talk about .']",0

How do teams qualify for Champion 's League ? Europe has so many major and minor leagues . Can you explain the qualification process to someone who knows next to nothing about how football is organized ? Explain like I'm five. ,"['A full answer is complicated . On a basic level , a certain number of slots are awarded to each league . Some of these slots are "" Automatic "" slots that immediately put a team into the group stages , others a qualifying slot that put teams into a short two - leg knock - out tournament that takes place before most of the European leagues begin for a spot in the real thing .

The Coefficient is supposed to be a ranking of the quality of leagues , and it is determined by the performance of teams in UEFA competitions over the past five years . Two points are awarded for each win in European competition , one point for a draw . bonus points are awarded for reaching the later stages of competition . Then , the total of each country is divided by the number of clubs that participated that year ( from that country ) . So , right , you use that to rank all the leagues in order .

As you move down the rankings , proportionally less places are awarded , until you get to the 53rd ranked league , Kosovo , who get one single slot into the earliest section of the qualifying competition .', 'Most leagues in Europe have automatic qualification ( top 2 - 4 teams ) , other leagues need to qualify via playoffs .

In the ""trip without acid"" videos, the creators use a series of still images or short video clips that are displayed in rapid succession, creating the illusion of a continuous, flowing image. The images are often carefully chosen and arranged to create a sense of movement or change, and they may also use techniques like color shifting or flickering to further enhance the illusion. The effect can be quite striking and can produce a feeling of disorientation or altered consciousness in some viewers. However, it is important to note that the videos do not actually produce any psychoactive effects or alter the viewer\'s mind or consciousness in the same way as drugs like LSD or other psychedelics. The effect is purely visual and does not have any actual psychoactive properties.']",1

"How do the ' remaster ' old movies to HD format For instance , how is it possible to produce a blu - ray , or similar high definition video of an old school movie like ( the original ) Star Wars ? Explain like I'm five.","['To ""remaster"" an old movie means to take the original film or video recording and improve its quality by cleaning it up and making it look better on modern screens. This process can be done with old movies that were originally shot on film, as well as with movies that were originally recorded on video.\r\n\r\nTo remaster a movie in high definition format, like Blu-ray, the first step is to find the best quality version of the original movie. This might be an original film print, or it might be a digital copy that was made from the film.\r\n\r\nOnce the best quality version of the movie has been found, the next step is to clean up any scratches or other defects on the film or video. This can be done using special software that can remove blemishes and improve the overall image quality.\r\n\r\nOnce the movie has been cleaned up, the next step is to transfer it to a digital format. This is done by scanning the film or video into a computer, or by converting the digital file to a different format.\r\n\r\nOnce the movie is in digital form, it can be edited and improved even further. This might include color correction to make the colors look more accurate, or adding special effects to make the movie look more modern.\r\n\r\nFinally, the remastered movie can be converted into a high definition format, like Blu-ray, and burned onto a disc or made available for streaming online.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps to explain the process of remastering an old movie in simple terms!

Later on , I text you , but you are n't sure that it is me , so you ask for the number on my device . If it matches yours , you can be pretty sure it is really me . That 's basically what is going on . The secret formula is designed so that every device can have its once unique version , and that is it is very , very hard to figure out the formula from just the numbers . One device is your key fob , and the other is a program running on the computer you are trying to connect to .

To overly simplify things , the database would just have a list of username : password , you enter your username and the correct password for that username - voila ! You get in ! The RSA SecurIDs add a 2nd level of protection , otherwise known as 2 - phase authentication . There is additional software installed on the authentication server ( i.e. : the server where that username : password database is stored ) which adds a 3rd item you have to enter in order to get logged in successfully . Each keyfob ( the grey keychain thing shown in that post ) has a unique serial number written on the back . If you \'ll notice one of the top comments said "" DO NOT POST THE BACK OF IT ! !

There is an algorithm used to generate a code on the keyfob , which is the same one used inside the server side software . With the same algorithm on each side , the authentication software knows what code should be displayed on your keyfob at any given time . To add * * another * * layer of security , you typically have to provide a personal pin on TOP of what \'s displayed on the keyfob . This is typically a 4 - 6 digit number that you choose yourself .

You can enter my house if you have the key , as well as the secret code on the pinpad . Here \'s where the fun starts . If i just told you "" the pin is 12345 "" ( that \'s the combination to my luggage ! ) then anyone could just extract that information from your head ( a la inception style ) and would have the same problem as me giving you the key .

The RSA SecurID works in the same way by being connected to a server and agreeing upon an equation and several other things . It uses AES-128 to generate the key ( iirc ) so it \'s secure . Every minute ( or whatever interval is set ) it generates a new value , and at the same time , so does the server .

Xelopheris writes : > Pi is what is known as an irrational number , in that it can not be expressed as an algebraic equation . Actually , there are plenty of irrational numbers that are solutions to algebraic equations , sqrt(2 ) being one of them -- both sqrt(2 ) and -sqrt(2 ) are solutions to the equation x ^ 2 = 2 . You probably wanted to write that pi is a * transcendental * number . If you start with the irrational numbers and take out any number that you can get by doing algebraic operations ( sums , differences , multiplications , divisions , exponents , roots , and these in any combination ) on any number of rational numbers , you * still * have some numbers left over . The ones left over are called the transcendental numbers , and pi is one of these . > And how do we know ? Well , this one is complicated . It started with an old problem in constructive geometry ( which means basically drawing figures with a straightedge and compass , using only inherent mathematical relationships in your drawing and not measuring as in , say , with a ruler ) . The problem was whether or not , given a circle , you could construct a square with the same circumference . You could think of this as starting with a rational number ( the length of a line ) and using basic operations ( constructing new lines and circles ) and getting to pi ( another line whose length was the circumference of the circle whose diameter was the line you started with ) . It was n't until the 19th century , when we had a lot more math than we did when the problem was posed , that we were able to prove that it could n't be done . I know I really have n't answered your last question , but if someone could explain the Lindemann - Weierstrass theorem in plain English ( because I ca n't ) , that would be the answer you are looking for . > And why is it random ? Simply put , we do n't know that it is . All we know is that it goes on forever and does not repeat . Strictly speaking , it is n't random at all , the digits of pi are a fixed , calculable set of numbers . But you might guess that the digits are pseudorandom and uniform -- namely that any given decimal place is equally likely to be any one of the digits from 0 to 9 . When we look at finite sections of the digits , it appears that the longer the section , the closer each of the digits get to showing up the same number of times . As yet , though , nobody has been able to prove that this will be the case no matter how far out we look . EDIT : typo and added the answer to the last question"", ""1/3 does the same thing except the random part . Obviously though PI is more than just a simple fraction . There are a variety of methods of calculating pi , but all of them kind of rest on an infinite repeating pattern that can always be added on to for more precision . For example , since we know pi to be a ratio between the circumference and the radius or diameter , all we really need for a given circle is to get the most precise measurement of it 's circumference and we can calculate pi from an easily measured radius . The problem is how to measure the circumference precisely . So for one method , imagine dividing a circle into slices , like a pizza . We can use the assumption that the ends ( the crust ) is flat so they make triangles to calculate perimeter by using simple trig to get all the lengths of the slices ' crusts and adding them up . With four slices to start , it 'd look horrible and be pretty inaccurate , we 'd calculate the perimeter of a square basically . But then we up the ante and maybe do 8 slices . The perimeter is of an octagon but much closer to the circle now . As you may start to see , this can go on infinitely and theoretically , it will never perfectly match up to the circumference of a circle . It 's a method such as this ( not exactly , but in a similar infinite series way ) that is used to calculate pi , and hence why no matter how many decimals we calculate to , we can always calculate more .""]",0
"How do the numbers after the decimal in pi just "" go on forever "" Why does it go on forever when virtually no other number does ? And how do we know ? And why is it random ? Explain like I'm five.","['Pi, denoted by the Greek letter π, is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. The value of pi is approximately 3.14, but it goes on infinitely without repeating in a predictable pattern. This means that if you tried to write out all of the numbers after the decimal point, you would never run out of digits. In other words, the digits of pi are ""random"" in the sense that they do not follow a pattern that we can predict.\r\n\r\nOne way to understand why pi is an infinite, non-repeating decimal is to think about trying to measure the circumference and diameter of a circle using a ruler. No matter how carefully you measure, there will always be some small amount of error in your measurement. This error will be especially noticeable when you try to measure a very large circle, because the ruler will be a very small part of the circle\'s circumference. As a result, the value of pi will always be an approximation, and the digits after the decimal point will never end.\r\n\r\nIt is also possible to prove mathematically that pi is an infinite, non-repeating decimal. One way to do this is to use a concept called ""transcendental numbers,"" which are numbers that cannot be expressed as the solution to any algebraic equation with a finite number of steps. It has been proven that pi is a transcendental number, which means that it cannot be expressed as the solution to any equation and therefore must be an infinite, non-repeating decimal.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps!

The molecules are called melanosomes and they are molecules that color feathers , usually these are "" down "" type of feathers , the light fluffy feathers you see .

As for the dinosaurs scales ; I do nt think we know .', 'There \'s a HUGE difference between "" colour "" and "" texture "" so they need to be examined differently . Colour is caused by dyes or pigments or the way in which light reflects off of microscopic structures ( such as a hummingbird \'s neck feathers ) . During fossilization , color can be preserved when the chemicals and materials are locked into an unchanging matrix that \'s completely protected from outside influence , such as a fly in amber ( the amber actually fossilizes , not the fly ) . But normal fossilization does not work that way - it replaces organic material with rock over time , chemically destroying or slowly leaching away the dyes . So you do n\'t know what color a dinosaur is , but you can make guesses . However , TEXTURE is entirely different . Many fossils are preserved because the organic material sits between two layers of mud or sediment ( example : many small fish fossils or clams ) , or because it makes an impression on one layer of mud ( touch clay and you \'ll leave a skin imprint ) . The lower layer of mud or silt or sediment is then covered by another layer . These layers then turn to rock . When you crack open that rock , the two layers separate out and leave a clear impression of the difference between the two layers , which could be the clear "" fingerprint "" of the skin texture . There are lots of examples of fossilized dinosaur skin that retain the skin \'s "" texture "" due to this fingerprinting process , but the colours are dissolved chemically and so disappear .']",0

How do the reproductive systems of female mammals that have full litters of offspring differ from human reproductive systems ? What enables them to have so many offspring at once ? Explain like I'm five.,"['In female mammals that have full litters of offspring, their reproductive systems are adapted to produce and carry multiple offspring at once. This is different from the human reproductive system, which is adapted to produce and carry only one offspring at a time. One key difference between the reproductive systems of these mammals and humans is the number of eggs that are released during ovulation. In humans, only one egg is released each month, while in mammals with full litters, many eggs are released at once. This allows the female to become pregnant with multiple offspring at the same time. Another difference is the size and structure of the uterus, which is the organ where the baby grows and develops. In humans, the uterus is small and only has enough room for one baby. In mammals with full litters, the uterus is larger and has multiple compartments, allowing it to hold and nourish multiple babies at once. Finally, the duration of pregnancy is often shorter in mammals with full litters compared to humans. This allows the babies to be born at a stage of development when they are better able to survive on their own. Overall, the reproductive systems of female mammals that have full litters of offspring are adapted to produce and carry multiple offspring at once, which enables them to have so many offspring at once.']",1

As the TBM digs, it creates a tunnel ""ring"" which is made up of segments of pre-cast concrete that fit together like puzzle pieces.

Streaming is when you watch a movie or TV show online, without downloading it to your device. Instead, the movie or TV show is sent to your device in small chunks, or ""streamed,"" as you watch it. It is generally harder to catch people who are streaming copyrighted content, because they are not actually downloading the file.

( Satellite ) Explain like I'm five.","[""Television ratings statistics are determined by measuring the number of people watching a specific television channel at a specific time. There are several different ways to measure television ratings, and each method has its own strengths and limitations.\r\n\r\nOne way to measure television ratings is through the use of Nielsen ratings, which are collected by a company called Nielsen Media Research. Nielsen uses a panel of households across the United States that agree to have their television viewing habits tracked. The panel is representative of the U.S. population as a whole, so Nielsen can use the data collected from the panel to estimate the number of people watching a particular television show or channel at a specific time.\r\n\r\nAnother way to measure television ratings is through the use of set-top boxes, which are devices that are connected to a television set and track what the television is being used to watch. Set-top boxes are often used by cable and satellite television providers to track their customers' viewing habits.\r\n\r\nIt is also possible to measure television ratings through the use of online streaming services, such as Hulu or Netflix. These services track the number of people who watch a particular show or movie on their platforms and can use this data to estimate the number of people who are watching at a specific time.\r\n\r\nOverall, there are many different ways to measure television ratings, and each method has its own benefits and drawbacks. It is important to keep in mind that no single method is perfect and that different methods may produce slightly different results.""]",1
"How do they digitally remaster old movies , and make them higher quality/ resolution ? Can someone please explain this to me ? Explain like I'm five.","['Sure! Digital remastering is a process that is used to improve the quality of a movie that was originally filmed on film or videotape. It involves taking the original movie and transferring it onto a computer, where it can be edited and enhanced using special software.\n\nThere are several ways that the quality of a movie can be improved during the remastering process. One way is to clean up any visual imperfections, such as scratches or dirt on the film, or to fix any audio issues, such as hissing or background noise. This can be done using specialized software that is designed to remove these types of imperfections.\n\nAnother way to improve the quality of a movie is to increase its resolution, which is the number of pixels (small dots) that make up the image. The higher the resolution, the clearer and more detailed the image will be. This can be done by using software to add more pixels to the image, or by using techniques like ""upscaling"" to make the existing pixels larger.\n\nOverall, digital remastering is a way to take an old movie and make it look and sound better by using modern technology.

How do they filmmakers take shots in front of mirrors without having the camera being in the reflection ? Is it just CGI ? Explain like I'm five.,"['Filmmakers can take shots in front of mirrors without having the camera being in the reflection by using a technique called ""keyhole blocking."" This involves carefully positioning the camera and the actors in the scene so that the camera is hidden behind a small gap, such as a gap between two objects or a door that is slightly open. This allows the camera to capture the action in the scene without being reflected in the mirror.\n\nAnother way to avoid having the camera reflected in the mirror is to use a special type of mirror called a one-way mirror. A one-way mirror is a mirror that is partially transparent, meaning that it is possible to see through it from one side but not from the other.

The filler is a thick, gooey substance that can be smoothed over the dent to fill in the damaged area. Once it's dry, the mechanic will sand the area down until it's smooth and even with the rest of the car.\\n\\nPainting the repaired area: After the dent has been repaired, the mechanic will need to paint the area to match the rest of the car. They will first apply a layer of primer, which helps the paint adhere to the surface. Then they will apply several layers of paint, using a special tool called a spray gun to apply it evenly.

How do they make decaffeinated coffee ? I would really like to know . Explain like I'm five.,"[""Sure! Decaffeinated coffee is made by removing most of the caffeine from regular coffee. Here's how it's done:\n\nFirst, the coffee beans are soaked in water to extract the caffeine and other flavors.\n\nThen, the water is treated with a special substance that removes the caffeine. This can be done using chemicals like methylene chloride or ethyl acetate, or it can be done using natural methods like carbon dioxide or water.\n\nAfter the caffeine has been removed, the water is drained off and the beans are dried.\n\nFinally, the decaffeinated coffee beans are roasted and ground just like regular coffee beans, and they can be brewed and enjoyed just like regular coffee.\n\nI hope that helps!

Explain like I'm five.","['Making a processor (also called a microprocessor) involves a lot of complex steps and specialized equipment. Here\'s a simplified version of the process:\n\nFirst, engineers design the processor using computer-aided design (CAD) software. This design includes the layout of the transistors (tiny switches that control the flow of electricity) and other components that make up the processor.\n\nNext, the design is printed onto a thin wafer of silicon using a process called photolithography. This involves using a special machine to shine light through a mask (a patterned film) onto the wafer, which transfers the pattern onto the silicon.\n\nAfter the pattern is transferred onto the silicon, the wafer is subjected to a series of chemical processes to create the transistors and other components.\n\nOnce the transistors and other components are created, the wafer is cut into individual processor ""chips,"" which are tested to make sure they are working correctly.\n\nThe finished chips are then packaged and sent to computer manufacturers, who use them to build processors for use in their products.\n\nThe term ""x nanometer process"" refers to the size of the transistors on the processor. Transistor size is measured in nanometers (nm), which are extremely small units of measurement (one nanometer is about 1/1000th the width of a human hair). A smaller transistor size means that the transistors can be packed more closely together, which allows for more transistors to be placed on a single chip. This can lead to faster and more efficient processors, since the transistors can communicate with each other more quickly. For example, a processor made with a 22 nm process will have smaller transistors than a processor made with a 32 nm process, which could make it faster and more efficient.']",1

By measuring the distance between the satellite and the receiver at different times, scientists can calculate how fast the continent is moving.For example, let's say that there is a GPS receiver on a continent, and a satellite orbiting the Earth above it.

"How do they recover deleted data from a HDD ? Does it remain on the disk ? If so , how does it free up space on the disk ? Please explain like I'm five.","[""Usually when you delete a file on a HDD the data is n't actually deleted . Instead , the drive is just told that the area where the data is stored is n't important anymore and it can be written over . If you keep using the HDD , it will eventually overwrite the old data , but the data will remain on the drive until then . Your operating system tells you that the space on the disk is free because it 's available to use for storage whenever you need it , but the computer is n't going to go changing the data until you have something else to store there . You can use a file shredder to clear the data out , but most people do n't do that . Additionally , HDDs use a magnetic field to store information . A strong field indicates a 1 and a weak field indicates a 0 . However , magnetic fields are n't binary and with a lot of work you can sometimes figure out what deleted data was based on the strength of the magnetic fields that remain . Edit : You ca n't actually recover any meaningful data this way . On older , less dense magnetic storage media it may have been a possibility , but that 's not the case with any relatively modern HDD . The idea comes from a guy named Gutmann who wrote a paper on it in 1996 . It would have been hard to do then and Gutmann himself has said it would be next to impossible these days . It works differently with internal SSDs . Those usually clear the data out after it 's deleted because and SSD can only store data in an empty spot . Consequently , your computer goes ahead and clears out the data after it 's deleted to speed up the process of writing new data to that area in the future ."", ""Do you know how a record works ? Do you know what an ice cube tray looks like ? Memory on magnetic media disks are allocated in chunks of space around the disk similarly to the track on a record . The chunks can be visualized using ice cube trays . No water in a cube block equals 0 . Water filled in the cube equals 1 . It 's not absolute empty or filled though . And I 'm skipping some info , but this should be good enough . Let 's say there are 10 cube slots in a standard tray . The first slot is used to denote the trays ' sequence numbers with regard to all others along the record track and whether a particular tray is available to modify water levels . The next eight are used for data water . The last one is used to either denote the end of the data or the location of the next tray in the sequence used to store the data which could not fit in this tray . If the data fits entirely within one tray , then the cube block after the last cube block used for the data is marked end of file and any remaining blocks remain unaltered . When you send something to the Recycle Bin what you 're actually doing is only changing that first cube block from telling the computer that tray is being used to store data the user wants to telling the computer the tray is available to be used to store new data . If the new data only takes up the first three cube blocks then the data left over from the previous file remains in those left over unaltered cube blocks . If you have lots of ice cube trays available , then the ones you thought you deleted may not have been overwritten , so your data can be recovered . If you have enough of these left over cube blocks ( slack space ) and you have a data carving program which looks at every cube block on the record track and knows how to piece together a wicked puzzle , then you can recover partially or mostly overwritten files . If you have a file shredding program designed to modify the water levels randomly in unused cube trays , then you are making recovery difficult . If you have an SSD , then all of this goes out the window ."", 'Hard drives have special sections at the start of the drive which contain an index of all the files on the drive . When a program needs to access a file , it looks at the index to find out where on the drive the file is , and then goes it gets it ( simplified , but this is ELI5 ) . When a computer deletes a file , it usually just removes it from the index . The actual data is still there on the drive , but the information about how to locate it is gone . Now , if you want to go find a file on the hard drive , you can just start looking at the actual data that is stored there . Most files have certain identifying traits . For example , JPEG files might always start with "" THIS_IS_A_JPEG_FILE "" ( again , ELI5 example ) .

This involves shooting a scene with the camera at an angle that makes objects in the foreground look larger than they are, while objects in the background appear smaller. This creates the illusion that the objects in the foreground are closer to the camera and are therefore subject to less gravity. \nAnother technique is called ""high-speed photography."" This involves shooting a scene at a very high frame rate, typically hundreds or thousands of frames per second. When the footage is played back at a normal frame rate, it appears as though the objects in the scene are moving much more slowly than they actually are. This can be used to make it look like objects are floating or moving slowly in a weightless environment. \nIn some cases, filmmakers will also use special effects and computer-generated imagery (CGI) to create the illusion of zero gravity. This can involve digitally altering the movement of objects in a scene or creating entirely digital environments that look like they are in space. \nIn the past, filmmakers have also used practical effects to create the illusion of zero gravity. For example, in the movie ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" the filmmakers used a special rig called a ""zero gravity plane"" to simulate weightlessness. The plane would fly in a parabolic pattern, allowing the actors to experience brief periods of weightlessness.

Then, the animators will watch the recording and draw the character\'s mouth movements to match the voice actor\'s spoken words. This process is called ""lip sync"" or ""lip synchronization."" Once the animators have drawn the character\'s mouth movements, they will create an ""animatic,"" which is a rough version of the scene with the voice audio and the character\'s mouth movements all put together. This helps the team check that the lip sync is working well and that the scene is timing out correctly. After the animatic is approved, the final step is to create the fully-animated scene. This includes adding in the character\'s body movements and any other details, like background art and effects. When all of these elements are put together, it creates the finished scene with the character\'s voice perfectly synced up to their mouth movements.']",1

The voice actors come in to record their lines , and then the animators have to work around those recordings , trying to translate the meaning and emotion of the voicework into the movements and expressions of the animation . After that , they just put the two together and they both sync up perfectly because the animation was tailored for the voice itself . In fact , in a lot of cases , some characters are practically born straight from the voice . Take Sherri Stoner for example , series writer and voice actress of Slappy the Squirrel from Animaniacs . The different people involved were pitching ideas for different characters to appear in the show . Sherri shared her idea of an aged retired cartoon actress which was a great idea on its own . But then she acted out the voice of the character as she saw it in her head and the rest is history with Slappy the Squirrel becoming a well known member on the Animaniacs cast . The voice acting came first before the animation , and the voice was used to help the animators sort of create a template from which they drew and animated her body and mannerisms . However , on the other hand , dubbing is a totally different scenario and is the situation most likely used in your question . Let 's say there is a foreign hand drawn animated film from Japan like Spirited Away for example . The animation and foreign voice work has already been done and there 's not much that can be done after that . Since a lot of regular people would prefer to listen to a movie rather than get subtitles , the studio rounds up a bunch of voice actors . The voice actors are given translated lines of the original script and stand in front of a huge screen that is projecting a silent version of the film . Then its up to the voice actors to try and say their lines while trying their best to either match the mouth work of what 's up on screen or just fit in as much of the line as one can in a scene ( Since in some instances , a ten word sentence in one language could be shortened to three in another language or needs four extra words in another language . ) While I know you do n't mean CGI either , CGI animated films are a lot easier to dub over . It 's the same regular schtick with voice actors dubbing over what 's happening in the film , but do n't really have to pay attention to the mouths ; they mostly have to pay attention to the timing to make sure they do n't go over or under the allotted time slot . Usually the original studio would give the dubbing studio access to the film 's files . Then the dubbing studio goes in and then edits the mouth movements so that they better match the dub 's voices while not interrupting the core animation .""]",0

How do those bladeless Dyson fans work ? How do they move air with no moving parts ? Please explain like I'm five.,"['Bladeless fans, like those made by Dyson, use a technology called ""air multiplier"" to move air. Instead of using blades to chop up the air and push it out like a traditional fan, a bladeless fan uses a small motor to draw in air and amplify it through a narrow aperture. Here\'s how it works: 1. The small motor inside the fan draws in air and pushes it through a narrow aperture (hole) at the base of the fan. 2. As the air passes through the aperture, it speeds up and creates a high-pressure zone. 3. Above the aperture, there is a loop amplifier, which is a ring-shaped tube with a smooth curve on the top. This loop amplifier helps to amplify the air coming out of the aperture and pushes it upwards. 4. The amplified air then flows over the loop amplifier and creates a low-pressure zone, which sucks in more air from the surrounding area. 5. The combination of the high-pressure air coming out of the aperture and the low-pressure air being sucked in from the surrounding area creates a continuous airflow, which cools and refreshes the room. So, even though there are no blades on a bladeless fan, it is still able to move air around the room by using a small motor and the principles of physics to amplify and circulate the air.']",1

As the bonds break and form to move from liquid to solid , they give off an excess of energy as heat ( an exothermic process ) . When you boil the gel pack in water , the heat takes it back past its melting point to turn it from crystal back to liquid and the heat from the boiling is what provides that energy ( endothermic process ) ."", 'They give off heat through "" phase change "" which is when something changes states , in this case liquid to solid . The energy involved in the actual change is a lot greater than the energy involved in just raising or lowering the material \'s temperature .

This is why the cooler of ice water can keep something cold for a long time , the changing phase from ice to water absorbs a lot of heat . The heat pack is the exact opposite change , it goes from liquid to solid which in turn gives off a lot of heat . This heat ( energy ) was put into the gel in the microwave to turn it into a liquid which ended up storing said heat . The seemingly magic part is how it is stored until it is needed . This is something called "" superheating "" and "" supercooling . "" What this means is that the material is beyond the freezing or melting point without freezing or melting . This can happen for a number of reasons , the biggest one being that phase change usually requires a starting point , called a "" nucleation site .

You might have heard that all snow flakes have a spec of dust at the center , this is because the super cooled water vapor only turned to ice when it nucleated on the dust particle .

Different substances have different freezing points and energy levels involved and this one is specifically chosen / designed for this purpose . The final part to the "" trick "" is the nucleation site which is the clicker . After you microwave the gel it sits as a liquid that wants to change into a solid but ca n\'t . Once you click the metal disk it creates a nucleation site which changes the liquid to a solid ( gel ) . This gives off the heat that was introduced by the microwave as the liquid turns rapidly to a solid .', ""The gel inside is a supercooled liquid .

You decide to test your luck and put a larger weight in the net , stretching the rope even more taut . But the net holds ! You realize the net can carry even more weight than 100 kg as long as you do n't disturb it ! This is how supercooled liquids work .

How do tilt shift filters work ? How does a filter make something look like a toy model Example : URL_0 Please explain like I'm five.,"[""Tilt-shift filters are used to give photographs a miniature or toy-like appearance. They do this by simulating the shallow depth of field that you would see in a photograph taken with a camera that has a very small aperture. When the aperture is small, only a small part of the photograph is in focus, while the rest of the photograph appears blurry. This makes the photograph look like it was taken from a distance, even if it was taken up close. To create this effect with a tilt-shift filter, you can use software or a special lens that allows you to adjust the focus of the photograph. You can choose which part of the photograph should be in focus and which should be blurry. You can also adjust the amount of blur to make the effect more or less pronounced. Here's an example of how a tilt-shift filter can be used to make a photograph look like a toy model: 1. Take a photograph of a real-life scene, such as a cityscape or landscape. 2. Use the tilt-shift filter to adjust the focus of the photograph so that only a small part of the scene is in focus. 3. Adjust the amount of blur to make the rest of the scene appear more blurry. 4.

When you download a file using a torrent, you aren't downloading it from a single source. Instead, you are downloading pieces of the file from many different sources. This is what makes it possible to download very large files quickly. To download a file using a torrent, you need a torrent client, such as uTorrent or qBittorrent. You can then use the client to search for and download the torrent file that you want. Once you have the file, you can open it with the torrent client and the download will begin. The client will connect to many different sources to download all of the pieces of the file, and it will also share the pieces that you have already downloaded with other people who are also downloading the file. As for how people obtain the files to upload on torrent sites, there are many different ways. Some people may create their own files, such as music or video, and then share them on torrent sites. Others may find files that have been shared by other people and re-upload them to different torrent sites. And some people may obtain files through illegal means, such as pirating movies or music.

However, trees are still able to produce a small amount of oxygen through a process called respiration, which occurs in all living cells. During respiration, trees and other plants take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide, just like animals do.So even though trees don't produce as much oxygen in the winter as they do during the growing season, they are still able to produce some oxygen through respiration. This is one of the reasons why it's important to plant trees and other plants in our communities – they help to clean the air and produce oxygen for us to breathe.""]",1

It all starts with a top and a bottom . Logically , it makes sense . Trees and other vascular plants have a top and a bottom . The top has a trunk , branches , leaves , or needles . The bottom is a system of roots . Each needs the other to survive . The roots hold the plant steady and grab moisture and nutrients from the soil . The top is in the light , conducting photosynthesis and helping the plant reproduce . You have to connect the two parts . That 's where xylem and phloem come in . The xylem of a plant is the system of tubes and transport cells that circulates water and dissolved minerals . As a plant , you have roots to help you absorb water . If your leaves need water and they are 100 feet above the ground , it is time to put the xylem into action ! Xylem is made of vessels that are connected end to end for the maximum speed to move water around . They also have a secondary function of support . When someone cuts an old tree down , they reveal a set of rings . Those rings are the remains of old xylem tissue , one ring for every year the tree was alive . But how does the plant eat ? Most plants have green leaves , where the photosynthesis happens . When those sugars are made , they need to be given to every cell in the plant for energy . Enter phloem . The phloem cells are laid out end - to - end throughout the entire plant , transporting the sugars and other molecules created by the plant . Phloem is always alive . Xylem tissue dies after one year and then develops anew ( rings in the tree trunk ) . What is the best way to think about phloem ? Think about sap coming out of a tree . That dripping sap usually comes from the phloem ."", ""There are standard , accepted approximate formulas for guessing a tree 's age based on its circumference . See URL_1 and URL_0""]",0

When a tree is young, it grows quickly and the cells are large and easily seen.

This new layer is called a ""growth ring."" The growth rings form a pattern that looks like a series of circles around the inside of the tree trunk.\n\nThe size of the growth rings can tell us a lot about the tree\'s life. If the tree had a lot of water and sunlight when it was growing, the growth rings will be wide. If the tree didn\'t have enough water or sunlight, the growth rings will be narrow.\n\nTo calculate a tree\'s age, you can count the number of growth rings on the inside of its trunk. This will give you an idea of how old the tree is. You can also measure the width of the growth rings to learn more about the tree\'s history.\n\nIt\'s not always possible to calculate a tree\'s age by looking at the outside of it.

In a turbofan engine ( as used on all modern airliners ) , there is more than one turbine . The first turbine drives the compressor . There may be more than one turbine / compressor shaft .

The turbine is a spinning wheel with blades on it that is turned by hot gases.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nFuel is burned in a special part of the engine called a combustion chamber. This creates hot gases.\n\nThe hot gases are sent through a pipe called a nozzle. The nozzle makes the gases go faster, which creates pressure.\n\nThe pressure from the gases makes the turbine blades spin.\n\nThe turbine is connected to a shaft, which is like a long rod. As the turbine spins, it turns the shaft.\n\nThe shaft is connected to a generator, which is a machine that makes electricity.

Explain like I'm five.","['The basic idea behind a union , is that an individual employee has very little power against the company , but all of the employees rallied together have power . The concept is called collective bargaining . So instead of each employee talking to their manager individually , and having wildly different requests , the employees get together , agree on a few things they want , and then talk to the employer as a group . Unions tend to work in cycles . As employers gain power , they want to do things like increase profits , which usually means lowering costs and increasing output , which sometimes means bad things for workers ( like making them work longer days ) . At some point , the workers get together , form a union , and fight back against the employer to improve their conditions . Then , once the power has shifted back to them , the union atrophies and becomes unnecessary or starts fighting for silly things , so it dissolves . Being able to form a union is incredibly important for our society , because the employer having all the power long term tends to be bad news for the common worker . In societies where forming a union is illegal , it tends to be very oppressive .', ""Unions came about because workers needed to be able to negotiate with employers and the only way to do that was to be a united front . In order to create an environment at a workplace that is n't killing off workers by overworking them , a union helped set limits on working hours . It also made sure that workers hired for the same job got the same wages , no matter what their race , creed or sex - a newly hired typist would make the same salary as another typist because they were hired in the same job category and level . Before unions , employers could hire people and pay them differently based on their race , creed , sex or any other difference - I 've heard stories about employers hiring women and paying them much less for the same jobs men were doing , or black workers hired at half the wages of a white worker . Unions leveled the playing field . But to do this people had to come together to create a group that could negotiate with employers . A union is a private group , like a civic organization . It collects dues from its members , and uses those dues to fund efforts to keep workers on an even playing field . It pays specialized negotiators to create working contracts that lay out wages , benefits and perks of each job under that union 's perview . It makes sure that bad - faith on the part of the employer can be stood up to by strikes that take profits out of the employers hands . Modern unions in the public sector ( such as teachers unions ) have a similar beginning , but a different outcome today . Modern public unions do not have the same recourse to strike as private sector unions do . The NYS [ Taylor Law ] ( URL_0 ) makes it harder for unions to strike , and many other states have similar law codes . Federal law is being wittled away as well . This is because employers at all levels do not like their profits being wittled away by union needs . Unions were created to help workers achieve some semblance of a good life - a working day that was n't 16 - 18 hours long , a weekend to recover and spend time with family , benefits that helped them when they got sick , pensions that took care of them in old age when they could not work anymore . But today those benefits are being pulled away little by little . Many states do n't want unions in their businesses and have Right to Work laws that make it so that a union can not force workers to be a part of their group at a workplace , can not force workers to pay into union dues . This keeps unions away from many states and keeps workers from making enough to live on or enough to pay for healthcare or other benefits . In short , unions achieve their purpose of insuring that workers are treated well and equally by collecting dues and using those dues to fund negotiations for contracts , benefits and pensions . This is an expensive proposition , so dues are high , but workers get benefits they usually do n't get without a workplace union ."", ""One person goes to the boss and demands a raise or the quit , and the boss will tell them not to let the door hit them on ass on the way out .

Unions also collect dues and use those dues to in theory help the members do things they could n't do on their own .

How do used vehicle exchange programs at car dealerships work?,"[""Used vehicle exchange programs at car dealerships, also known as trade-in programs, allow customers to trade in their current vehicle when purchasing a new or used vehicle. Here's how the process typically works:The customer brings their current vehicle to the dealership and speaks with a salesperson about the trade-in program.The salesperson will assess the value of the customer's current vehicle based on factors such as its make, model, age, condition, and mileage. They may use tools such as the Kelley Blue Book or the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) guide to help determine the value of the vehicle.The salesperson will then present the customer with an offer for the trade-in value of their current vehicle. The offer may be based on the value of the vehicle as determined by the dealership, or it may be based on the customer's desired purchase price for their new vehicle.If the customer agrees to the trade-in offer, they can use the value of their current vehicle as a credit towards the purchase of a new or used vehicle at the dealership.The dealership will then take possession of the customer's current vehicle and may sell it to another customer, wholesale it to another dealership, or send it to auction.It's important to note that trade-in values are often lower than the private market value of a vehicle, as dealerships need to make a profit when they resell the vehicle. However, trade-ins can be a convenient way for customers to get rid of their current vehicle and use its value towards the purchase of a new one.""]",1

How do video game cheat code devices ( Action Replay / Gameshark ) work ? What exactly does the device do to create a cheat code environment ?

How do video game cheat code devices ( Action Replay / Gameshark ) work ? What exactly does the device do to create a cheat code environment ? Please explain like I'm five.,"[""Games ( and any software ) will load elements that it needs to use into the device 's memory . These cheat devices find where that piece of code lives in memory and modifies it . So basically it looks in memory for where your number of lives are stored and changes it to whatever you tell it to . In the case of setting something to unlimited the cheat device prevents the game from changing what is stored in memory ."", 'The most basic type of code you would program into the device is a RAM Overwrite code . The simplest example of this would be an infinite money cheat . The developers working for AR or Gameshark load up the game on whatever developer hardware they have and play for a bit . Eventually , they would take a note of how much money the game says they have , and also take a snapshot of the contents of RAM . Then they could go buy some stuff and take another snapshot . At this point , they could do a search through the RAM snapshot for the value of money that the game showed when it was taken ( say $ 1000 ) . This would give them all the RAM locations containing the value 1000 . Doing the same for the second snapshot , they would get all the locations containing 800 ( for example ) . A simple cross - reference should yield the locations in RAM that contain a reference to the value of money the player currently has . If there \'s a lot of results , more snapshots would help narrow it down . If there are still multiple results after several snapshots are correlated , it probably means that the value for money is stored in multiple locations . This could be because one is a "" saved "" value and one is a "" working "" value , or , the value is copied at some point for computation , but not overwritten with something else when the computation is done , or the game has some sort of error checking system where all the values must match . At this point , the cheat developer would start playing around with what happens when the values are manually changed . Once they figure out which RAM locations actually control the value of money , they take those locations , along with some value ( say 9999 for example ) , and make a RAM Overwrite code . When you program this code into your cheat device , it instructs the device to periodically ( many , many times per second ) overwrite whatever value is in those RAM locations with 9999 . So , when the player goes to buy something , the new value of money is calculated for the purchase , but shortly afterwards , the cheat device rewrites the value as if it never happened . The code itself that you program into the cheat device just contains some value indicating the type of code ( RAM Overwrite in our above example ) the RAM address to overwrite and the value to write with . Also , most companies will take the code and encrypt it so that only the cheat device can decrypt it and figure out what the code is supposed to do . This just protects the work they put into developing the cheat . Another important type of code is the Enable code , and is a bit tougher . With most cheat devices , you have to have an enable code to use any other cheats for the game . This ties into our above example where we talked about RAM locations being overwritten many times per second . Doing this is actually not that simple . The cheat device does n\'t have access to RAM at all , not while the game is running . The only thing it can do is , when a request is made to get read - only data from the cartridge ( code to be executed , graphical data , audio data , etc . ) the cheat device can intercept it and send something else instead . To get access to RAM , the cheat device needs a hook , a mechanism by which it can begin inserting its own executable code into the game code . To do this , the cheat developer needs to find some spot in the game code to insert the hook , which will probably involve replacing some game instruction ( or several ) with another instruction ( or several ) that will attempt to access the cartridge in some way that the cheat device will recognize . This can only be done with expertise , as finding a good hook point involves finding some game code that is run very frequently , that can be modified without breaking the game , and that can handle being halted for significant periods of time ( while the cheat device runs its code ) without affecting the performance or responsiveness of the game . For example , the cheat developer could use a section of code that checks the status of the controller buttons , to see if any have been pressed , which pretty much every game needs . This gets run very often , but messing with it could affect the game \'s responsiveness to button presses , and the player might feel that the game is laggy . The Enable code itself will contain the following . ( A ) Information for the hook instruction(s ) such that during any normal cartridge read , if the hook instruction is part of the read , the cheat device will automatically swap the game \'s instruction out for the hook instruction and send it instead . ( B ) Optionally , as this may not need to be different from game - to - game , information about what "" special operation "" the hook instruction will perform , which signals to the cheat device that it needs to start sending its own executable code to be run . ( C ) Optionally , information about where the cheat device \'s code will be loaded into RAM . Running from RAM as opposed to ROM is much , much faster , and less likely to cause "" lag "" issues as described above , but requires that there be enough space in RAM to load all the code , without affecting the game . ( D ) Optionally , information about the instructions that the hook replaced , which may still need to be executed in some way . Again , this is still a pretty basic picture of the kinds of things cheat devices do . All of the above assumes , for example , that the game does n\'t contain any type of anti - cheat measures . The Pokemon series is probably the most famous for anti - cheat . Individual Pokemon that you \'ve caught are made up of 100 - byte blocks of memory ( in Gen 3 , more bytes are used in later Gens ) most of which are encrypted and checksummed . Additionally , the actual locations of the blocks in the cartridge flash memory varies , and the entire contents of flash memory are checksummed , preventing any changes from being made without also changing the checksum value . The encryptions and checksums are not that complicated and are actually pretty well documented and easy to fake for developers and people with special hardware , or emulators , but doing so from a cheat device that has to rely on hooks and limited access to RAM is pretty damn difficult .', 'In addition to /u / wcrb15 \'s answer , I \'d also add that just like modern PC games have built - in functions meant for the use of devs during the game \'s creation and testing , older games often had these as well . So , if the GameShark programmers knew how to activate a specific developer feature ( like "" god mode "" so the dev does n\'t get killed while testing the boss he \'s debugging ) , they would include that in their product as well .']",0

Please explain like I'm five.","[""It varies by company , but at the two places I once worked ( which were on the lower end of the industry ) we basically had a layer of API code that sits between the game engine and the platform , and that API layer translated all of the inputs from a particular platform ( from the controller , keyboard , mouse , etc ) into platform - independent input data that the engine could process without knowing the platform . Then the engine would spit out generic outputs , which the API layer would transform into platform - specific graphics and whatnot . Our art teams , meanwhile , would typically have to export all of their materials in a different format for each platform , to best leverage that platform 's graphics system . The advantage of this approach is that you spend less time customizing the game for each platform . The chief disadvantage is that it 's harder to really push the boundaries of what each system can do , and you end up with games that are a bit less ambitious , have less jaw - dropping visuals , and run a bit slower . Higher end studios , like EA Sports , probably put a LOT more money into customizing games for each platform . This is also really only true of the large - format platforms : Xbox , PC , etc . Handhelds , especially with all the phones and tablets on the market now , have such wildly different technical capabilities that developers at all levels have to do a lot more customizing for each platform ."", ""To understand how it 's done it 's important to understand that there are various situations in where platform differences manifest . The areas where those differences exist , is where we focus our efforts on abstraction , such that for a particular component that is different ; we have a particular solution . In the grand scheme of the final video game , we hand pick the right components and you 're left with a final video game that targets some platform . Need another platform ? Just work on a solution for one of these components . There are however situations in which these components can not be . To conceptualize such a component ( API ) , you have to make a contract in which that component communicates or functions ( ABI ) . If the differences between components are too vast , then the contract would need to change to satisfy all components . This is why sometimes to support another target you must first break an existing one . What you 'll often find is that as you support more targets your contract tends to get more vague . This is a major pain in the ass . Another more obvious example is performance . Video game consoles , computers , hand - held devices , etc all tend to vary quite drastically in how they function internally . These internal differences are sometimes exploited by very clever programmers to achieve high performance characteristics . This exploitation is not easily transferable to other targets however , in fact sometimes it is n't transferable at all ."", 'To go deeper than the "" game engine does it for you "" level of other answers : Say you want to put the letter A on the screen . We will say the game engine call looks like this : put_letter_on_screen(""A "" ) The game engine implements it like this : if $ platform is xbox360 then do print_letter(""A "" ) if $ platform is ps3 then do draw_character(""A "" ) $ platform is a placeholder for an actual value . What the game developers then do is change the placeholder like this $ platform = xbox360 and build the code This all happens automatically and is supported by the game engine itself so all they have to do is click a button and it builds everything .']",0

"How do waves transfer Energy I m talking about Tsunami waves . How much energy does it transfer ? Where does it come from , where does it go ? How fast do they move ? Please explain like I'm five.","[""Tsunami waves like all ocean waves occur because two molecules ca n't be in the same place at the same time . This is a basic fact of fluid dynamics . So when waves ' move ' the water is mostly staying in the same place because it moves very little . But it bumps up against the water molecules around it giving up their energy and stopping as they 've given it up . But whatever molecules they just bumped into now have the energy and so they move a short distance , bump into something , give it up and stop etc . It 's like those desktop toys with the metal balls clanking back and forth . The balls themselves do n't move , or they move very little . They mostly act as a conductor of energy . So a tsunami originating in Japan travels as an energy wave ' through ' the water . The water itself does n't move so Japanese water stays in Japan even if the tsunami is moving towards Hawaii . This is also the reason why at sea a tsunami is not even really noticeable . The energy is spread out immensely from top to bottom , so you have a huge mass of water bouncing around but the wave is only centimeters high . It still has energy because of how much water is in play though . As the wave approaches shallower depths , the energy stops being spread out among large masses of water , and starts being concentrated , by the decreasing depth , and the wave starts growing taller and taller . This focusing of the energy also causes the waves to slow down in speed , and increase in height . In the open ocean a tsunami energy wave travels incredibly fast , like jet speed fast . As it comes up onto shore though it 's much slower , but much taller , and at that point water is moving not just acting as a conductor . The slow waves at the coast , with fast waves coming in behind it , causes a surge , pushing large amounts of water near the shore so not only do the waves get tall , but the local sea level also rises . This is why the water on land looks like it 's risen and flooded instead of just immediately washing back out to sea ."", 'thermal energy in earths magma below crust > kinetic energy in tectonic plates ( earthquakes underwater ) > kinetic energy in water . the energy is then lost in a lot of ways , i m guessing , at a fundamental level , because work is done against gravity as it moves out of the sea , but also friction with everything the tsunami contacts according to this link URL_0 the 2011 tsunami in japan had an energy ~1.3x10 ^ 14 Joules ( as a low estimate )', 'So , think of it this way , little Tim - Tom - Mathis - Tong , our planet is n\'t exactly solid . We float on these big plates of rock . Think of them exactly like dinner plates , except much much bigger , so they could hold at least 10 times more of your Mom \'s disgusting meatloaf . So these plates are just floating on top of liquid magma , and every now and then the plates collide or separate . When this happens , those plates actually moving sends a huge shock wave out into the water . The thing about liquids is that they act like they \'re composed of a bunch of little bouncy balls . Now , what happens if you push one bouncy ball in a stack of bouncy balls ? The other balls move . So , when this plate releases this huge shock into the water , it creates a "" wave "" of movement that emits from wherever the center point of those plates touching was . As the balls keep moving away they dissipate that energy , or speed , to each other ball . But as the energy wave goes closer to land , it has less and less balls to push . So that energy becomes more concentrated , and it becomes so concentrated that it creates a massive wave of water ! AND BOOM ! IT KILLS GODZILLA ! Yeah , what a jerk wave , right ?']",0

Please explain like I'm five.","['A tsunami is a large wave that is caused by an underwater disturbance, such as an earthquake or a volcanic eruption. When an underwater disturbance occurs, it causes the water to move and creates a wave that travels through the ocean.Tsunami waves are able to transfer a large amount of energy because they are very long and very high. They can travel at speeds of up to 500 miles per hour, which is faster than a commercial airplane.The energy for a tsunami comes from the disturbance that caused it. This could be an earthquake or a volcanic eruption, which releases a large amount of energy that is then transferred to the water and creates the wave.When a tsunami reaches the shore, it can cause damage to buildings and infrastructure because of the large amount of energy it has. The wave can also cause flooding and erosion along the coast.Tsunamis are very powerful and can be dangerous, so it is important to be prepared and to know what to do if you are in an area where a tsunami is likely to occur.']",1
How do we accurately place objects into different orbits ? How do we ensure there wo n't be collisions with the thousands of other objects orbiting the earth ? Please explain like I'm five.,"['They actually go through a process of deconflicting where each object is . We know where pretty much every single shred of thing is there in space above the size of a screw , so we place stuff where they are needed and where they can go . Also ... Space is * huge * there is plenty of room up there .', ""Turns out , there actually are agencies out there who manage all of this . The most notable being the US Navy . ( I think ? If someone could confirm that that would be great ) Most satellites are destined for geostationary orbit , which is by far the easiest place to manage space traffic . Due to the way geostationary orbit works , any satellite in that orbit will always be at the same height , going the same speed , and in the same direction . Ignoring small perturberances to a satellite 's orbit , you could theoretically line up satellites into a huge conga line that stretches around the Earth , and have it fly around forever without any satellites colliding . In a way , that 's kind of how it works . There is a line of satellites in geostationary orbit stretching around the Earth , filled with all of the gps satellites , all the satellite TV and radio satellites , communications satellites carrying internet traffic , etc , all separated by miles of space between each satellite of course . When someone wants to launch a satellite into geostationary orbit , they pick a spot in this giant conga line and register their choice with the US Navy , then they carefully fly their satellite into its slot in geostationary orbit . Of course , no orbital placement is perfect , and satellites might drift out of their slots , but when that happens , each satellite has on board propulsion systems that can move the satellite back into position . When the satellite is old and outdated , the satellite is usually moved into a higher orbit , called a graveyard orbit , where satellites go to die , and its spot in the conga line goes to another satellite . Other satellites that do n't go into geostationary orbit are usually much harder to control , however , they are watched religiously by workers on the ground . Before any satellite launches , simulations of the satellite 's orbit over its entire lifetime is run , to ensure that the planned orbit will not collide with any other satellites at the same altitude . If a satellite drifts out of its orbit at any time , controllers on the ground will always be there to steer it back into position . Typically when the lifetime for these low orbit satellites is over , they reenter the atmosphere and burn up , ensuring that it does n't become space junk ."", ""The radius of earth is roughly 6400 km . Add to it 200 km of atmosphere , and you end up putting 10 m² satellites on a 83000 km² surface . Plenty of space to launch rockets and other satellites . If you 're asking how do we put an object on orbit , it 's easy to understand : we calculate the gravitationnal force between what we want to launch and the object we want it to be on orbit on . Then , we launch the rocket in order for it to be tangent to a circle ( the orbit ) of center the object and of radius the one calculated using the force mentionned earlier . info : F = G*M1*M2 / D² and a Fundamental Law of Dynamics and it 's done ;)""]",0
How do we accurately place objects into different orbits ? How do we ensure there wo n't be collisions with the thousands of other objects orbiting the earth ? Please explain like I'm five.,"['Orbiting an object means moving around it in a circle while staying a certain distance away from it. To put an object into orbit around the Earth, we have to use a rocket. \nThe rocket has to be powerful enough to lift the object off the ground and high into the air. Then, the rocket has to be pointed in the right direction and go fast enough to escape the Earth\'s gravity. If the rocket goes fast enough and is aimed at the right angle, the object will start orbiting the Earth. \nTo make sure that there aren\'t any collisions with other objects in space, we use a system called ""traffic control."" Traffic control helps us track where all the objects in space are and where they\'re going. We use computers to do this. If two objects are going to get too close to each other, we can use traffic control to send a signal to one of the objects and change its course so that it doesn\'t crash into the other object. This helps us keep track of all the objects in space and make sure that they\'re all safe.']",1

Once enough properties of a new element have been measured , and it has been proven to exist , a new element can be added to the table . The trick to this is that really big nuclei are unstable , no matter how many neutrons that you stick together , and these large atoms are very , very short lived before decaying . We think that ( for non ELI5 reasons ) there is a stretch of a few atoms a little larger than those that we are producing now that will last for a longer time and may have practical uses , but these have not yet been made .']",0

To measure the amount of vitamins and minerals in a food, we use special chemicals that can detect these substances and measure how much of them are present. The nutrition labels on food packaging show the amounts of different nutrients in the food, such as calories, protein, fat, and carbohydrates. These labels are based on the results of the tests that are done to measure the nutrients in the food. It's important to remember that the nutrition labels on food packaging are not always completely accurate. There can be some variation in the amount of nutrients from one batch of food to another, and the methods used to test the food and measure the nutrients can also affect the accuracy of the labels.

DAMN HOMIE K so anyways these cells are always splittin just doin their thing and then 1 day BOOM one of the cells mutates or does n't split properly and then u got urself some cancer . The cancer is infectious so if u do nt catch it early enough its gon na spread 2 the rest of ur body and it becomes more dangerous . hopefully i answered ur question dude"", ""To answer the second part of your question , reasons why cancer occurs can be genetic ( receiving genes from your parents that do n't let cells know when to stop dividing ) , chemical ( e.g. smoking cigarettes or drinking too much alcohol over a long period of time ) , radiation ( such as prolonged and unnecessary exposure to x - rays ) , and some factors also include your diet , level of physical activity , and some infections ."", 'So to start off , cancer is the uncontrolled growth of cells in the body . There \'s a lot more to it than that , but invariably all types of cancer can be described in that way . It \'s also important that you understand that the body is made up of millions of different types of cells . These cells have specific function and are what make your organs different from eachother - I.e the reason your kidneys and heart do n\'t do the same thing is because the cells in the two organs are vastly different and have very specific functions . Despite these vast differences many types of the cells begin at the same point and are stimulated to change into specific types of cells by the environment they are in . This growth occurs continuously as cells are not perfect and do eventually break down and need replacing - hence the body either stimulates the death of the aging and progressively failing cell or it fails and is replaced by a new cell with ( hopefully ) the same function . Given the enormous amount of cellular growth required to maintain normal function and the fact that this process is not perfect there are mistakes made and these mistakes can generally cause a loss of , gain of or change of function . These mutations occur normally and are managed by the body in a number of different ways by the body - some immune cells are tasked with recognising abnormal or malfunctioning cells and inducing their death . Beyond this , growth of cells does not normally occur without specific messenger chemicals being secreted locally ( locally being important here as these chemicals are incredibly specific and essentially guide the cells growth from it \'s precursor to the highly specialised cell it is destined to become ) , there are anti - growth signals that prevent excessive growth and there also exists a number of mechanical like mechanisms that prevent cells from growing too large or outside of their normal limits . Cancers that do grow rapidly also use a lot more energy as a result and thus require their own blood supply to grow beyond a certain limit . In short , there \'s a massive number of ways the body stops individual mutations and cells from becoming cancers that can metastasize or spread to the rest of the body . Cancer is the result of what is essentially a "" perfect storm "" of cumulative mutations that allow the cell to continue growing and/or reproducing beyond normal constraints . These mutations do not always cause cancer if they occur on their own - for example , a mutation that allows cells to avoid immune recognition will not , on it \'s own , result in a cancerous growth . Instead , you need mutations that together allow the cell to avoid immune recognition , allow it to grow unchecked by either produce it \'s own growth stimulating chemicals or be able to grow without them and also resist anti - growth signals , allow it to stimulate the growth of blood vessels ( because the cancer needs it \'s own blood supply for it \'s necessary nutrients ) , allow it to invade other tissue and spread by re - establishing itself in other areas of the body , allow replication of the cells to continue indefinitely and finally resist all signals that attempt to induce death of the cells . Clearly , there is a lot of things that have to go wrong for a cancer to develop and the chance of these mutations happening together is very low in any one instance . Things that increase this risk are basically anything that increase the number of cellular generations - the biggest being time , then anything which causes cell death ( radiation , smoking , certain diseases , inflammation etc ) and then finally some people are born with genetic mutations that make them more susceptible to subsequent mutations - e.g mutations in the cellular machinery that prevent excessive growth or genetic disorders that inhibit immune function and so forth . Honestly not sure if that answers your question , I \'ve written this over the course of the day after seeing the post early in the morning so I \'m not terribly sure how well it reads . If I have just wandered around a bit too much or anything is overly simplified let me know and I \'ll try answer it properly .']",0

Once the signal has been received on Earth, it is sent to a computer, which processes the data and turns it into images or other types of information.

For example, Banksy often uses stencils to create his graffiti, so if a piece of graffiti was made using stencils, it is more likely to be by him. \nOverall, while it is not always possible to know for certain if a piece of graffiti is by Banksy or not, experts can use a combination of these methods to make an educated guess.""]",1

I understand how we figure the real distance of closer bodies , but how do we know a quasar is 30 million light years away , or that Andromeda is 2.5 million light years away ? Please explain like I'm five.","[""There are a couple of tricks you can use involving the parallax effect , measuring an object from two different locations to attempt to triangulate it 's position , though that becomes less effective the further away it is . There 's also a doppler effect which helps us : The further away an object is , the faster it 's moving away from us . No matter which direction , that rule holds up . If that 's confusing to you , try to imagine the universe as a balloon that 's expanding , and we 're a dot , placed on the surface of the balloon using a sharpie . Another star is another dot . As you blow more air into the balloon , everything gets further apart . But these tools eventually break down for sufficiently distant objects , and it 's hard to tell the difference between a nearby red , dim star , and a far away bright bluer star . For those objects there is a miracle in Cosmology , known as the [ Type Ia Supernova ] ( URL_0 ) . It 's a little complicated to explain , but basically it works like this : Let 's say you 've got a binary star system . ( There are lots of those . ) And let 's say one star is more massive than the other . ( Lots of those , too . ) Now let 's say the bigger star has already burned out into a White Dwarf . There are lots of those as well . Now , if the bigger star has burned out , the smaller star probably has not . That 's because the larger a star is , the * shorter * it 's lifetime . The big stars burn hotter and faster . Now , you 've got this binary system , where one White Dwarf circles a hydrogen - helium sister . The gravity from the White Dwarf is massive , so the orbit 's likely to decay from tidal forces . Eventually the White Dwarf is going to start siphoning hydrogen off the surface of it 's sister . Now , as it does , it immediately fuses that hydrogen off it 's surface into more carbon & oxygen , which is what White Dwarfs are made of . And it starts getting more massive . The White Dwarf continually accretes mass until it hits a point known as * Chandrasekhar mass * , ( it 's very very close to , but not exactly equal to the * Chandrasekhar LIMIT * ) which is the limit where electron degeneracy can no longer hold back the collapse of the star . Now here 's the magical part : At that moment , an infinitesimally short time before hitting the limit , that White Dwarf star is 100 % * * degenerate matter * * . That means every atom in the star is in precisely the same quantum state . Or , at least , they 're all in the absolutely lowest quantum state possible for each atom . Why is this relevant ? Because the moment the White Dwarf crosses the * Chandrasekhar mass * , * * every single atom in the star undergoes fusion at once ! * * This is a massive , amazingly energetic explosion , that totally obliterates not only the White Dwarf , not only the sister star , but also the solar system they live in . But most importantly , because every White Dwarf that crosses that limit has exactly the same mass , * * EVERY TYPE Ia SUPERNOVA IS EXACTLY THE SAME ! * * They all look alike in spectrum and magnitude , and we can calculate what they look like ! So this wonderful supernova , where every single one looks exactly the same , gives us a perfect calibration tool to determine how far away they are . We look at the spectrum , realize it looks like type Ia , only redshifted by some amount , and we calculate the amount of redshift , which tells us how far away it is . We can also compare these Ia 's to other stars nearby to determine what 's in front of them , and what 's behind ."", 'One way to measure the distance between Earth and some astronomical body is through parallax .

Please explain like I'm five.","['There are a few ways that we can determine the distance to stars and other objects in the universe. One way is by using something called parallax. Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of an object against the background when viewed from different angles. For example, if you hold your finger up in front of you and close one eye, then open that eye and close the other eye, your finger will appear to move against the background. This is because you are looking at it from two different angles. We can use this same principle to determine the distance to nearby stars. By measuring the apparent shift in the position of a star against the background of more distant stars (as viewed from opposite sides of Earth\'s orbit around the sun), we can calculate how far away the star is. This method is most accurate for stars that are relatively close to us (within a few hundred light-years). For more distant objects, such as quasars and galaxies, we use other methods to determine their distance. One such method is called the cosmic distance ladder, which involves using a series of ""rungs"" or steps to measure the distance to increasingly distant objects. Each rung of the ladder relies on a different type of ""standard candle,"" which is an object that is known to have a certain intrinsic brightness. By measuring the brightness of the object as seen from Earth, we can determine its distance. For example, one type of standard candle that we use is a type of star called a Cepheid variable. These stars have a very regular pulse, and the time between pulses is directly related to the star\'s intrinsic brightness. By measuring the time between pulses, we can determine the star\'s brightness, and therefore its distance. Once we have determined the distance to a Cepheid variable, we can use it as a ""rung"" on the cosmic distance ladder to measure the distance to other objects that are farther away. For example, we can use Cepheid variables to measure the distance to nearby galaxies, and then use those galaxies as ""rungs"" to measure the distance to even more distant galaxies. This way, we can build up a ""ladder"" of distances that reaches all the way out to the most distant objects in the universe.']",1

One way is through the use of radiocarbon dating, which can be used to determine the age of organic materials like wood or bones.

Another way to determine the age of something is through the use of radioactive isotopes, which are types of atoms that are unstable and emit radiation as they break down into stable atoms. By measuring the amount of a radioactive isotope in a sample, scientists can determine how long it has been since the isotope began to decay. There are also methods for determining the age of non-organic materials, such as rocks and minerals. One such method is called potassium-argon dating, which can be used to determine the age of rocks and volcanic materials. This method works by measuring the amount of a radioactive isotope of potassium in a sample, and comparing it to the amount of a stable isotope of argon that is present. Overall, scientists use a variety of techniques to determine the age of different materials, and they often use multiple methods to confirm their results.']",1
How do we know humans are monogamous ? I have been wondering what actual scientific evidence we have for humans being monogamous . I keep thinking that it is just what we have always been told but is there any evidence that it is so ? Explain like I'm five.,"[""Generally speaking , among primates and most mammals , you can determine whether or not a species is naturally monogamous by the relative size of the male to the female . Gorilla , for example , have much larger males than females . They are polygamous . Same holds for Chimpanzees . This biological reason comes down to the fact that in a polygamous system , males have to compete for not only the best females but for all the females . Thus , being larger guarantees success . In a monogamous species , all males and females ( each roughly 50 % of the population ) have equal access , and males and females tend to be the same size . So , humans are naturally polygamous , from a biological perspective . But before you start blaming religion and society , recall that monogamy in humans actually predates religion and even agriculture as part of human society . So how do we explain this ? Well , consider the first humans who started living together in defined groups . Maybe they create a camp . Discovery of fire , etc . By this point , their tools and social structure has already put them on the apex of their environment . They have no natural predators anymore , and the population is already beginning to boom . Which means that back then ( as today ) there existed a certain scarcity of resources which would later be solved by agriculture . Now , when we have a scarcity of resources , we have competition . In this case , between two or more different GROUPS , or tribes , of humans . Which means that now we need to ensure that our tribe , not just the individual , is the most fit . This means that we need two things : a stable population size ( lots of warriors ) and genetic diversity ( healthy warriors ) . This does not happen if you have , say , a harem - type polygamous system . Because even though one man can get all the women in the tribe pregnant ( you know , if he HAS to ) , that 's going to ensure that the next generation has very low genetic diversity ( They 're all half - siblings ) . If this continues , one tribe is going to be significantly inbred , and we all know what that looks like . So , consider two tribes . One tribe , as part of their social structure , is fine with letting the chief ( biggest male ) have all the women . Another tribe , by chance , pairs up men and women via a ceremony ( early marriage ) . Each tribe lives 5 generations until they come together and have a war . Who is more likely to win ? The second tribe . Project this over a hundred and fifty thousand years of human pre - history , and it becomes advantageous for humans , who as animals are naturally polygamous , to become monogamous for the good of the tribe , which is a novel organizational level that genetics has n't accounted for . An voila , the paradox is solved . Sort of . See , monogamy was required for the survival of tribes and small social systems . But today , we no longer have tribes . We have vast and genetically diverse cities and towns and nations worth of potential sexual partners , and absolutely ZE - RO need to fear for long - term inbreeding . All the while , our animal brains are telling us to be polygamous , an instinct which is not likely to ever go away . Hence , you know , all sexual drama of the last ten thousand years . Why do we do it ? Because the social structure that were NECESSARY to keep tribes together and functional ( religion , government , etc ) became by necessity aligned with monogamy . And we have n't yet separated those two ideas . Yet being the key word . tl;dr : We are naturally polygamous . We once needed to be mongamous to survive .

For example, humans have a long period of parental care and investment in their offspring, which may have led to the development of monogamy as a way to ensure that both parents are involved in caring for their children.\n\nOverall, while there is some evidence to suggest that humans may have a natural inclination towards monogamy, it is important to recognize that there is a wide range of relationship patterns that humans engage in and that monogamy is not the only option.']",1

The way that gravity affects the motion of objects is through the curvature of spacetime.Imagine that spacetime is like a stretchy fabric, like a rubber sheet. If you put a heavy object, like a bowling ball, on the fabric, it will cause the fabric to stretch and bend. If you roll a smaller object, like a marble, towards the bowling ball, the marble will be attracted to the bowling ball and will roll towards it, following the curve of the fabric.This is a simple way to understand how gravity can be thought of as a curvature of spacetime, rather than a force. In reality, the concept of spacetime is a bit more complicated, but the basic idea is the same.On the other hand, forces like electromagnetism do not cause objects to curve through spacetime. Instead, they act directly on the objects themselves, causing them to accelerate or change direction. For example, when you rub a balloon against your hair, the electrons in your hair are attracted to the balloon, causing an electrostatic force that makes your hair stand up. This force is acting directly on the electrons in your hair, rather than causing the fabric of spacetime to curve.I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.']",1

( English has * furnace * . ) Lat . * formica * > Sp . * hormiga * , Fr . * fourmi * , meaning * ant * . ( Eng . The chemical ants sting you with is * formic * acid . ) Lat . * fumus * > Sp . * humo * , Fr . * fumée , Eng . * fume * , all meaning * smoke * . Spanish also shows o > ue , o > u , and e > ie in many situations , which wo n't be unfamiliar to you if you 've ever had to conjugate Spanish verbs . But , it has happened historically to their nouns , too . Lat . * ovum * > Sp . * huevo * , for * egg * . Lat . * febris * > Sp . * fiebre * for Eng . * fever * . The point here is that sound changes are very regular in languages , so that if we know the rules , and we know the modern language , we can reconstruct what the old language would have sounded like . Spanish has a lot more of what we call [ * fricative * ] ( URL_0 ) consonants where Latin would have had * stops * , so Latin sounds more punctuated , and Spanish more lax . We can similarly make such determinations for English and its sister languages ( the Germanic languages , like German , Dutch , Swedish , Danish , etc . ) , to discover their parent language ( proto - Germanic ) , which is much less preserved than Latin is for the Romance languages . Among these are [ Grimm 's Law ] ( URL_4 ) , [ Verner 's Law ] ( URL_1 ) , and , in English , the [ Great Vowel Shift ] ( URL_3 ) . This last one occurred between Middle and Modern English , after our spelling was mostly set , and explains why we pronounce words like * breakfast * totally different than they are written . Finally , we * can * actually make attempts to join our entire language family back into one ancestor , called [ proto - Indo - European ] ( URL_5 ) . This created the Germanic languages , the Romance , the Greek , the Slavic , Sanskrit and Hindi , among many others . These reconstructions are , of course pretty shaky and variable , but there 's tons of evidence out there to reconcile . Some linguists want to take it back even further , to the ancestor of all languages , but that 's not considered feasible by most . We 're talking a language spoken hundreds of thousands of years ago , that developed into Mandarin and Marathi , Japanese and Javanese , Arabic and Athabaskan , English and Igbo . Unlikely , but interesting . So , that 's probably more than you were asking for . Did I at least answer your question ? Note : I know many people think English is a Romance language descended from Latin , but this is not true . We get a lot of our vocabulary from Latin via French because of that little Norman invasion in 1066 , after which the French ruled England for centuries , giving us many words we consider emphatically upper - class to this day . Are we eating * pig * , or * pork * ? * Kingly * or * royal * ? * Smart * or * judicious * ? * Bright * or * luminous * ? The second in Each pair is the French - derived . You can even tell it 's Norman French instead of standard , because we use some peculiar Norman sound changed - French words ( g > w initially ) , like * William * and * war * , where French today has * Guillaume * and * guerre * ."", ""My high school Latin teacher said that the Romans actually wrote down how they sound for educational purposes . That is , they wrote about how the foreigners are misprouncing latin , maybe . I know that 's not a good source , sorry ."", 'To add to the other comments , my first year linguistics lecturer told us that we actually get a lot of pronunciation clues from spelling errors . People normally mis - spell a word in the way it sounds to them .

"How do we know what dead languages ( Latin , Ancient Greek , etc ) sounded like ? How do we know the pronunciation of these languages when they 've been dead for 100s of years and there 's no audio records of them being spoken ? Explain like I'm five.","['Great question! To understand how we know what dead languages sounded like, we need to understand a little bit about how languages work.\n\nLanguages are made up of sounds called ""phonemes,"" and each language has its own set of phonemes. When we write a language down, we use symbols called ""letters"" to represent the phonemes. For example, the word ""cat"" has three letters in it, but it is actually made up of three phonemes: ""k,"" ""a,"" and ""t.""\n\nDead languages like Latin and Ancient Greek are no different. Even though we don\'t have any audio recordings of these languages being spoken, we can still figure out how they were pronounced by looking at the letters that were used to write them down.\n\nFor example, in Latin, the letter ""c"" was pronounced differently than it is in English. In Latin, ""c"" was pronounced like the ""k"" sound in ""cat."" So, if we see the word ""catus"" written in Latin, we can guess that it was pronounced like ""katus,"" with a hard ""k"" sound at the beginning.\n\nThere are also other clues that can help us figure out how a dead language was pronounced. For example, we can look at how words changed over time, or how they were borrowed into other languages. By looking at all of these clues together, we can get a pretty good idea of what dead languages sounded like.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.']",1
How do we know what the Earth 's core is made of ? To say that a book from that science guy says so does not qualify .

By studying these waves and how they travel through the Earth, scientists can learn about the different layers of the Earth and what they are made of.\n\nAnother way that scientists have learned about the Earth's core is by studying the way that the Earth's magnetic field works. The Earth has a magnetic field because it has a core made mostly of iron and nickel. The movement of this molten metal creates an electric current, which in turn creates a magnetic field. By studying the Earth's magnetic field, scientists can learn more about the composition of the Earth's core.\n\nFinally, scientists have also used satellites to study the Earth's gravity field.

Then NREM 3 , which typically happens after 40mins ; brain waves are very large and slow . Most noises will not wake you and if you are awoken you will be discombobulated . If this happens in middle of night you will not remember . Lastly , the deepest stage is the REM stage where rapid eye movement irregular breathing / heart rate occurs and of course lucid dreaming . The brain waves paradoxically are fast and sporadic like when awake but most of your muscles are paralyzed . These four stages cycle through and the last deepest REM stage gets longer with each successive cycle . The last REM sleep occurs and lasts about 60 - 90 mins before waking . Then you return to the light stage where sleep is easily disturbed . Also , the biorhythm for the stress hormone cortisol reaches its highest levels upon waking which makes you jittery , prompting arousal .

How do we really know 1 + 1 = 2 Straightforward . Did any mathematician or scientist ever prove this ? And How ? Please explain like I'm five.,"['One plus one equals two is a basic principle of mathematics that can be understood and demonstrated through simple counting. To prove that 1 + 1 = 2, we can start by counting objects. For example, if we have one apple and we add another apple, we have a total of two apples. We can also use blocks or other objects to demonstrate this concept. In mathematics, we use symbols to represent numbers and operations. The symbol ""+"" is used to represent the operation of addition, which means to combine or add two numbers together. So when we write the equation ""1 + 1 = 2,"" it means that if we add the numbers 1 and 1 together, the result is 2. This may seem like a simple and obvious fact, but it is actually a fundamental principle that underlies much of modern mathematics. It is a concept that is used as the basis for more complex mathematical operations and equations, and it is an essential building block for understanding higher mathematics.']",1

Please explain like I'm five.","[""There are a few different ways you might be able to recover lost files from a corrupted hard drive or one that has had files deleted from it. Here are a few options: 1. Check the Recycle Bin: If you accidentally deleted the files, they may still be in your Recycle Bin. You can try looking there first to see if you can restore them. 2. Use a data recovery software: There are many different software programs that can help you recover lost files from a hard drive. These programs can scan the hard drive and try to find any files that are still there, even if they have been deleted or the hard drive is damaged. 3. Try a system restore: If the hard drive became corrupted after installing a new program or making some other change to your computer, you might be able to use a system restore to go back to a time when the hard drive was working properly. This can sometimes help recover lost files. 4. Take the hard drive to a professional: If none of the above options work, you might need to take the hard drive to a professional data recovery service. These companies have specialized tools and equipment that can often recover data from even severely damaged hard drives. It's important to note that there's no guarantee that you'll be able to recover lost files, especially if the hard drive is severely damaged or the files have been deleted for a long time.

When new files are created , they occupy this "" free space "" ( not actually empty , but space that has no file entries pointing to it ) on the drive . As long as the space has n\'t been written over by another file yet , you can recover the files with the right software .

How do we self - induce sleep ? What happens in the body / brain when I lie down and essentially make a voluntary decision to go to sleep ? Explain like I'm five. ,"[""Contrary to popular belief-- needing it . You have a human , sleep cycle used to be 4hrs at a time , twice per diurnal cycle , now a whole 8 hours . If you google ' human sleep cycle ' , you will see for the first 4 hours or so of the sleep cycle dedicated to some rem , the normal alpha and beta , and the delta deep sleep . After that is a long period of cyclic rem sleep until you launch out of it . No delta sleep is ' normal ' , after the delta sleep cycle , is a period of recouping a lot of REM sleep . This is because obviously as mammals for quite sometime we were nt necessarily safe sleeping 8 whole hours in a deep enough sleep to heal up and rest up our gigantic brains . The extra rem at the end is just your brain recouping since you are nt having another 4 hr sleep cycle with REM and delta wave deep sleep . Fast forward to modern life and the physical strain is not much of an issue , its the mental and social strain that works through our day . Remember rest itself is /rest/ , recovery . The brain is efficient at logical tasks , social tasks , but the body and its stress from physical expendeture is an entirely different thermodynamic expendeture , and homo sapian biology , when it comes to rest , is very dependent on the body 's hormonal cycling after physical work to garner enough chemicals to turn your brain off . Sleep is the time you also produce Human Growth Hormone . This hormone is used everywhere , not just the brain . The biofeedback to get these mechanisms in action that correspond overall to quicker and deeper sleep requires your body to ultimately be expended through a days work .

You can do your own sleep experiment like this . Notice after a day of intense brain activity but not much body activity you sleep in a restful night . Chances are its less than 8 hours on average . Physical labor but not much mental flexing will favor the other end of the sleep spectrum , deep delta wave sleep , so maybe 6.5 - 8 hrs .

This can happen through international treaties, which are agreements between different countries that outline rules for how wars should be fought. For example, the Geneva Conventions are a set of international treaties that contain rules about the treatment of prisoners of war, the medical care of wounded soldiers, and the use of certain weapons. One way that weapons can be banned is if they cause unnecessary suffering or injury to people. For example, poison gas, which is a type of chemical weapon, has been banned from use in war because it can cause severe burns and respiratory problems, and can be very painful for those who are exposed to it. Similarly, certain types of land mines, which are hidden explosive devices that are buried in the ground, have been banned because they can continue to cause harm and injury long after a conflict has ended. Another way that weapons can be banned is if they are considered to be too destructive or uncontrollable. For example, nuclear weapons, which are extremely powerful bombs that use atomic reactions to create a massive explosion, have been banned from use in many parts of the world because they can cause widespread destruction and death. Overall, the goal of banning certain weapons is to try to make wars less destructive and to protect civilians and other non-combatants from unnecessary harm.']",1

It is also during this stage of sleep that the muscles in your body become relaxed, including the muscles in your genital area. When a person has a wet dream, it is because their body has naturally released sexual fluids during sleep. This is a normal bodily function that can happen to anyone, regardless of their age or gender. Wet dreams do not have any direct control over your brain or thoughts. They are simply a natural part of the sleep cycle.']",1
How do whiskey companies deal with the fact that the product they make today gets sold to a market 15 years in the future ? How do you respond to shifts in demand with a latency of 15 + years for the maturation of your product ? Explain like I'm five.,"['If the demand is higher than predicted : * Raise prices , of course * Offer more whisky that has n\'t been aged as long . If a distillery produces both a 12 and an 18year bottling , they may choose to release more of the 12 year right away . Of course that means 6 years later they \'ll have less available at 18 years . At that point they \'ll either make less money or try to raise prices on the 18 . * Right now , some distilleries that traditionally offered only 12 year and older are starting to release younger whisky , such as 10 or even 8 year old . If demand is lower than predicted : * Hold some to sell later . * Release something called a "" bastard malt "" . That \'s a whisky that does n\'t have the original distillery on the label , and is sold cheaper than the branded bottles . It \'s not necessarily true that these bottles will be as good as the ones that carry the true distillery name . The taste of the whisky in every cask is different , so the best casks can be retained for the distillery brand . One thing that gives the distilleries a little more flexibility is that the age on the bottle does n\'t mean all the whisky in the bottle is exactly that many years old . It \'s actually * minimum * age in the bottle . Everything in the bottle is at least that many years old , but may be older . \\ * Edit Fixed some typos that made me sound like I \'d had a dram or two before answering .', 'Mackmyra whiskey from Sweden solves this in a fun way . They let you buy casks with a group of friends , you get to follow the journey of that batch and taste it during the aging progress ( I believe once every year or so ) , the kicker is that you pay a hefty overprice for this in order to fund their future products ( the usual aged whiskey ) but you get a really unique experience and insight in return .', ""There are some new distilleries starting up in Texas that are having to deal with the fact that they ca n't sell new whiskey as bourbon until it has aged a certain amount .

The plan is to eventually just sell aged bourbon , but they have to do something in the mean time to show profit to their investors . This strategy may not be relevant to the big established producers , but it works for the small specialty producers .""]",0
How do whiskey companies deal with the fact that the product they make today gets sold to a market 15 years in the future ? How do you respond to shifts in demand with a latency of 15 + years for the maturation of your product ? Explain like I'm five.,"[""Whiskey companies have to plan ahead and anticipate changes in demand for their products. They do this by keeping track of trends in the market and trying to predict what people will want to drink in the future. To make sure they have enough whiskey to meet future demand, they might make more whiskey today than they think they will need right now. This extra whiskey will be stored in barrels and left to age for several years. The aging process is an important part of making whiskey. As the whiskey sits in the barrel, it takes on the flavors and characteristics of the wood. The longer it ages, the more complex and refined the flavor becomes. So, even if the demand for whiskey changes over time, the whiskey that has already been made will still be of high quality. It's also worth noting that different types of whiskey have different aging requirements. For example, Scotch whisky must be aged for at least three years in oak barrels, while Bourbon must be aged for at least two years. So, even if the demand for a particular type of whiskey changes, the company will still have to wait for the whiskey to reach the minimum aging requirement before it can be sold. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.""]",1
How do wire transfers get settled?,"[""Wire transfers normally run through either the Fedwire system or the Clearing House Interbank Payments System (CHIPS). The process generally works like this: You approach a bank or other financial institution and ask to transfer money. You give the bank a certain code, either an international bank account number or one of several other standards, which informs the bank where to send the money.  The bank sends a message through a system like Fedwire to the receiving bank, along with settlement instructions.  This is where the process can get a bit tricky. For the wire transfer to work, the banks must have reciprocal accounts with each other, or the sending bank must send the money to a bank that does have such an account with the receiver. If the sending bank sends the money to a third-party bank, the transaction is settled between them, and the money is then sent to the receiving bank from the third-party bank. This last transaction may be a wire transfer, ACH transfer, etc.  The Federal Reserve fits into this because many banks hold accounts for this purpose with the Federal Reserve. This allows them to use the Fed as the third-party bank referred to above. Interestingly enough, this is one of the significant ways in which the Fed makes a profit, because it, along with every other bank and routing agent in the process, collects a miniscule fee on this process.  You'll often find sources that state that Fedwire is only for transferring large transactions; while this is technically correct, it's important to understand that financial institutions don't settle every wire transfer or payment immediately. Although the orders are put in immediately, the financial institutions settle their transactions in bulk at the end of the business day, and even then they normally only settle the difference. So, if Chase owes Bank of America $1M, and Bank of America owes Chase $750K, they don't send these as two transactions; Chase simply credits BAC $250K.  You didn't specifically ask about ACH transfers, which as littleadv pointed out, are different from wire transfers, but since ACH transfers can often form a part of the whole process, I'll explain that process too. ACH is a payment processing system that works through the Federal Reserve system, among others. The Federal Reserve (through the Fedline and FedACH systems) is by far the largest payment processor.  The physical cash itself isn't transferred; in simple terms, the money is transferred through the ACH system between the accounts each bank maintains at the Federal Reserve.  Here is a simple example of how the process works (I'm summarizing the example from Wikipedia). Let's say that Bob has an account with Chase and wants to get his paycheck from his employer, Stack Exchange, directly deposited into this account. Assume that Stack Exchange uses Bank of America as their bank.  Bob, the receiver, fills out a direct deposit authorization form and gives it to his employer, called the originator. Once the originator has the authorization, they create an entry with an Originating Depository Financial Institution, which acts as a middleman between a payment processor (like the Federal Reserve) and the originator. The ODFI ensures that the transaction complies with the relevant regulations. In this example, Bank of America is the ODFI.  Bank of America (the ODFI) converts the transaction request into an ACH entry and submits it, through an ACH operator, to the Receiving Depository Financial Institution (RDFI), which in this case is Chase bank. Chase credits (deposits) the paycheck in Bob's account.  The Federal Reserve fits into all of this in several ways. Through systems like Fedline and FedACH, the Fed acts as an ACH operator, and the banks themselves also maintain accounts at the Federal Reserve, so it's the institution that actually performs the settling of accounts between banks.""]",0
How do wire transfers get settled?,"[""When a wire transfer is initiated, the funds are transferred electronically from the sender's bank account to the recipient's bank account through the network of banks that handle the transaction. This process typically involves three steps:Authorization: The sender's bank verifies that the sender has sufficient funds in their account to complete the transfer and authorizes the transaction.Settlement: The banks involved in the transfer transfer the funds from the sender's account to the recipient's account. This typically happens in real-time or within a few hours, depending on the type of wire transfer and the banks involved.Reconciliation: The banks reconcile their records to ensure that the correct amount of funds has been transferred and that both the sender's and recipient's accounts are accurately reflected.Wire transfers can be settled through a variety of systems, including the Federal Reserve's Fedwire system in the United States, the SWIFT network for international transfers, and other proprietary systems operated by individual banks.""]",1
How do wireless providers make money from MVNOs ? Would n't creating competition that undersells your own same product while also using your own network be bad for business ? Explain like I'm five.,"['MVNO \'s are based on the internal accounting principle that every cost shall be applied to the business unit that consumes the good or service . Basically , think of Sprint ( which is the major network company that serves MVNO \'s ) as two companies : a wireless network operator , and a wireless service retailer . The network operator builds , maintains and operates the network . The wireless service retailer buys service from the network operator , and resells it to retail customers in the form of cell phone contracts . Using the aforementioned accounting principle , the network company \' buys \' the network ( by building it ) and \' manufactures \' wireless service ; the retail company buys finished wireless service from the network and resells it to consumers . It \'s similar to how car manufacturers work - Ford builds a car , then sells it to a dealer wholesale , who then sells it to a consumer , retail . Ford makes a profit when they sell it to the dealer , and the dealer makes a profit when they sell it to the consumer . In actuality , the dealer \'s profit on the sale of a single car is often larger than Ford \'s profit on the same single car is , but Ford sells millions of cars , whereas the dealer sells maybe a few hundred . The MVNO goes to Sprint ant says "" I can buy the wireless service from your network division for the same amount that your internal retail division does , but I can add value ( lower cost , better service , different phones , different payment methods , etc ) that your retail division ca n\'t or wo n\'t . "" Sprint likes this , because it helps earn extra revenue for the network , without doing things it might not like to do ( eg , cutting prices , or changing policies that discriminate against lower - income consumers ) . So your question starts from a few flawed premises : > creating competition Most of the MVNO \'s on Sprint \'s network ( for example ) do n\'t compete with Sprint ( they are going after a different market segment - usually pay - as - you - go customers who do n\'t or ca n\'t get contracts ) . > undersells your own same product They are underselling the retail division , but they pay at least the same rates as the retail division does for network access - and potentially more . In addition , the MVNO \'s probably have to make volume commitments ( ie , guarantee that they will buy $ X Million in service per annum ) which is great for your balance sheet because big commitments are cheaper than a bunch of small ones . > using your own network be bad for business ? From the perspective of the network company it is n\'t , because they are getting paid more money for the same network service ( ie , they have to pay for the network regardless of how many users are on it , by getting more users they are able to spread the cost of maintaining the network over more users and thus increase profitability ) . It \'s actually a kind of \' best of both world \'s \' mode . Vertical integration actually sucks for shareholders . Wall Street and banks like it , but in the long run it destroys the company through stagnation .', 'It \'s actually a pretty clever tactic . If you were selling things , would n\'t it be great to be able to only show people your expensive items , until you were sure they were n\'t going to buy from those , and then ( and only then ) , show them your less expensive items ? This is basically what having MVNOs allows the providers to do . A lot of wireless customers will just go to the nearest Verizon ( or AT & T or Sprint ) store and sign - up for whatever plan seems the most affordable with the right features . By limiting the plans ( and price points ) they offer , providers can push people into buying more than they need ( or paying more than they should for what they need ) . Doing that causes a lot of people to say , "" Never mind , I guess I do n\'t need a cell phone . "" By allowing MVNOs to exist , the providers can "" recapture "" these lost customers . Getting a customer that pays less than you want is always better than not getting them at all . It took me a looong time to get a cell phone . I wanted a cell phone for * very * occasional use . Like , I might make a 5 minute call once a week or so . I was n\'t willing to pay more than about $ 10 / month for that , though . None of the providers had anything for me . About two years ago I discovered a Sprint MVNO that had what I was looking for . I had n\'t known about MVNOs before that time , or I would have been a customer sooner . Because of that MVNO , Sprint got some of my money rather than none of it . So it was a win for Sprint ( and me ) . The providers need to be careful ( and they are ! ) that they do n\'t lose too many customers to the MVNOs . When they balance it right , they get more profit than they would if they just made a perfect - fit plan for every possible customer themselves .', ""The thought is that MVNOs can reach additional customers that the wireless providers would n't have been able to acquire by themselves . They do this by targeting specific groups of customers ( those who want pre - paid or no - contract plans ) , offering different phones and devices , and generally differentiating them in some way from the wireless provider . There 's definitely some cannibalism that goes on , but the hope is that the MVNOs bring in a net gain to the wireless provider .""]",0
How do wireless providers make money from MVNOs ? Would n't creating competition that undersells your own same product while also using your own network be bad for business ? Explain like I'm five.,"[""Wireless providers, also known as mobile network operators, make money by selling access to their wireless networks to other companies. These companies are called mobile virtual network operators, or MVNOs. MVNOs do not have their own wireless networks and instead, they purchase access to a mobile network operator's network and resell it to their customers under their own brand.\n\nCreating competition through MVNOs can be good for business because it allows the mobile network operator to expand their customer base and potentially increase their revenue. Additionally, MVNOs often target specific customer segments, such as budget-conscious consumers or those who want a specific type of service, which can help the mobile network operator appeal to a wider range of customers.\n\nFor example, a mobile network operator might have a brand that primarily targets business customers, while an MVNO that uses their network might focus on offering low-cost plans to budget-conscious consumers. In this way, the mobile network operator can still make money from the MVNO's customers, even if the MVNO's plans are less expensive than the mobile network operator's own plans.\n\nOverall, allowing MVNOs to use their network can be a good way for mobile network operators to increase their revenue and reach a wider range of customers, while still maintaining control over the quality and reliability of their network.""]",1

How do you choose which mortgage structure is appropriate when buying a home?,"[""When choosing a mortgage structure for buying a home, there are several factors to consider:Down payment: The amount of money you have available for a down payment can affect the mortgage structure you choose. If you have a large down payment, you may be able to qualify for a conventional mortgage, which typically requires a down payment of at least 3% of the purchase price. If you have a smaller down payment, you may need to consider a government-insured mortgage, such as an FHA loan or a VA loan, which have lower down payment requirements.Interest rate: The interest rate on your mortgage can significantly impact your monthly payments and the overall cost of your loan. Consider comparing mortgage rates from multiple lenders to find the best deal.Loan term: The loan term is the length of time over which you will pay off your mortgage. Short-term mortgages, such as 15-year loans, typically have lower interest rates but higher monthly payments. Longer-term mortgages, such as 30-year loans, have higher interest rates but lower monthly payments.Affordability: It's important to choose a mortgage structure that fits within your budget. Be sure to consider your other financial obligations and future plans when deciding how much you can afford to pay each month.Prepayment penalties: Some mortgages have prepayment penalties, which means that you'll be charged a fee if you pay off your mortgage early. This can be a factor to consider if you think you may sell your home or refinance in the near future.It's a good idea to speak with a financial advisor or a mortgage lender to discuss your options and determine the best mortgage structure for your needs.""]",1
How do you choose which mortgage structure is appropriate when buying a home?,"[""Down payment: Emphatically avoid PMI if at all possible; it's pouring money down the drain. Do 20% down if you can, or pay off enough to bring you above 20% and ask for PMI to be removed as soon as you can. Beyond that it's a matter of how much risk you want to accept and how long you'll own the place, and you'll have to run the numbers for the various alternatives -- allowing for uncertainty in your investments -- to guide your decision. Do not assume you will be able to make a profit when you sell the house; that's the mistake which left many people under water and/or foreclosed on. Do not assume that you will be able to sell it quickly; it can take a year of more. Do not assume immediate or 100% occupancy it you rent it out; see many other answers here for more realistic numbers.... and remember that running a rental is a business and has ongoing costs and hassles. (You can contract those out, but then you lose a good percentage of the rent income.) Double mortgage is another great way to dig yourself into a financial hole; it can be a bigger cost than the PMI it tries to dodge and is definitely a bigger risk. Don't.""]",0
How do you compare the sales of a company like Coca Cola against another company like JPMorgan Chase to figure out the best investment opportunity?,"[""The question isn't sales but profits. Banks traditionally profit by making loans. Just as with a physical product, there are costs involved, income produced, and the difference between the two is gross profit.

Or you can just  buy index funds, get average rates of return, and not have to think about it.""]",0
How do you compare the sales of a company like Coca Cola against another company like JPMorgan Chase to figure out the best investment opportunity?,"[""There are a number of factors that can be considered when comparing the sales of two companies in order to determine the best investment opportunity. Some of the key factors to consider include:Market size and growth: The size of the market in which a company operates can significantly impact its sales and revenue. A company operating in a large and growing market may have greater potential for growth and profitability compared to a company operating in a smaller or declining market.Market share: The market share held by a company can also be an important factor to consider. A company with a large market share may have a competitive advantage over its rivals and be better positioned to generate strong sales and revenue.Financial performance: It's important to examine a company's financial performance, including its sales and revenue growth, profitability, and financial stability. A company with strong financial performance may be a better investment opportunity compared to a company with weaker financials.Valuation: The valuation of a company, as reflected in its stock price or other financial metrics, can also be an important factor to consider when comparing investment opportunities. A company with a high valuation may be considered overvalued and therefore less attractive as an investment compared to a company with a lower valuation.It's also worth considering other factors such as the management team, competitive landscape, and industry trends when comparing investment opportunities. It's generally a good idea to conduct thorough research and due diligence before making any investment decisions.""]",1

"" This sort of guessing is usually done by hand . * Use general assumptions of which passwords are more likely . This goes from ( a ) using dictionary words , ( b ) simple variants of dictionary words ( changing letters to numbers ) , ( c ) letter combination frequencies ( "" batedima "" is a more likely combination of letters than "" gajhhhhha "" ) , etc . This sort of guessing is usually automated as a computer program , and works best when combined with the third technique ( just below ) . Third technique : steal a password database . This one \'s easy to misunderstand , because while it sounds like this would give you everybody \'s password , any well designed password database uses a nearly unbreakable secret code for the passwords . But the really neat thing you can do if you steal the password database is that you can guess passwords for * all * of the users at the same time .

To put it simply , you 're just guessing the password . There 're many applications and scripts to do so , most of them use dictionaries and optimised algorithms for easier word search . The time required for cracking the password highly depends on its complexity and how powerful the system running bruteforce script is . That 's why some sites ask you to put different case letters , digits and symbols for better protection .

A password that is just a single word, even if it is a random word, is generally not very strong because it is easy for a computer to guess. On the other hand, a password that is a combination of words, numbers, and symbols is much harder to guess and therefore is considered stronger.\n\nIn the example you gave, the password ""cheese"" might be easy for someone to guess, especially if they know you like cheese or if they see you using the word in other places (for example, if you have a social media account with the username ""cheeselover"").

Please explain like I'm five.","['The value of diamonds and other precious stones is determined by a combination of factors, including rarity, size, quality, and demand.Rarity: Diamonds and other precious stones that are less common are generally more valuable. This is because they are harder to find and there is less supply of them.Size: Larger diamonds and precious stones are generally more valuable than smaller ones, because they are rarer and more impressive. However, the value of a diamond or other precious stone can also depend on the quality of the cut, which can affect its overall appearance and sparkle.Quality: The quality of a diamond or other precious stone is evaluated based on a set of standards known as the ""Four Cs"": cut, color, clarity, and carat weight. Cut refers to the shape and proportions of the stone, color refers to the absence of color (the more colorless a diamond, the more valuable it is), clarity refers to the presence of inclusions (imperfections) within the stone, and carat weight refers to the size of the stone. The higher the quality of a diamond or other precious stone in these categories, the more valuable it is.Demand: The demand for a particular type of diamond or other precious stone can also affect its value.

Koopa starts slow but at top speed he is very fast . Mario is in the middle category . Switching gears from 1 through 5 is like switching from Princess to Mario to Koopa as you are driving .

Sure a best of 2/4 is simile to 4/4 but they work different ."", ""Here are the basics : 2/4 will have a 1 - 2 feel to it with 1 being strongest and 2 being slightly weaker ( volume wise ) . 3/4 will have a 1 - 2 - 3 feel , with 1 being loudest and 2 - 3 being about the same . 4/4 will feel like two 2/4 bars , but the 3 will be somewhat weaker than 1 . This is by far the most common time signature . 5/4 will feel like a 2/4 followed by a 3/4 ( or vice versa ) , but this is getting into the realm of esoteric contemporary music . They can usually tell if this is the case if the tempo keeps switching between 2/4 and 3/4 in a regular fashion . 6/8 will sound like 2/4 with 3/4 stuck inside each beat ; 3/4 with 2/4 stuck inside each beat will usually be 6/4 . And the 4/4 2/4 analogy works on 6/4 3/4 , but who knows . Other than that , you are getting into the range of crazy composing and that 'll be case by case ( I think I 've seen 11/8 before ?

"How do you figure out the BPM , and the key of a song ? I always wondered this , sorry if a dumb question . Thanks in advance . Explain like I'm five.","['Figuring out the BPM, or beats per minute, of a song can help you understand the tempo and feel of the music. There are a few different ways you can do this:\n\nUse a metronome or drum machine: These devices can help you tap out the beat of the song and give you an accurate BPM measurement.\n\nUse a BPM detection app or website: There are many free tools available online that can analyze a song and give you an approximate BPM measurement.\n\nCount the beats yourself: If you have a good sense of rhythm, you can try counting the number of beats in a minute of the song. This can be a bit more difficult and may not be as accurate, but it\'s a good way to get a rough estimate.\n\nTo figure out the key of a song, you can listen for the ""tonic"" or ""root"" note, which is the main note that the music centers around. The key of a song is typically named after this note. For example, if the tonic note is C, the key is C major. You can also try playing the song on an instrument and see which notes sound good and which ones don\'t. This can give you a sense of the scale that the song is using and help you determine the key.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.']",1
"How do you figure out the BPM , and the key of a song ? I always wondered this , sorry if a dumb question . Thanks in advance . Explain like I'm five.","['BPM : Stands for Beats per Minute , also called \' tempo \' - it means \' how fast the piece is played . \' There are a lot of caveats and complications to this question , so I \'ll just tell you how I do it and leave out as much of the Music Theory stuff as I can . So a piece of music has a rhythm , the rhythm is the way notes are played in time ( so if you clap out the "" LET \'S GO , LET \'S GO , L - E - T - S - G - O "" chant , the rhythm is the clapping . Even lyrically stuff , like the melody or lyrics , has a rhythm ) . The Tempo of the song is \' encoded \' in the rhythm because the tempo is what determines when those \' claps \' happen . When I am determining the tempo I am \' integrating \' the information of the rhythm with the rate at which the claps are happening , and determining what \' bpm \' the performer used when s / he played the song . I will begin tapping my foot or finger in time with my estimated rhythm , and while I am doing so I will continue to listen to the song to make sure that my derived tempo continues to agree with the tempo of the song . I will then use a clock ( or watch ) to compare that to the length of a second , and can estimate ( usually within 20 bpm ) what the tempo of the song is by subdividing the length of a second . Determining the key is much simpler , because it is universal and relates to a physical constant . I do not have perfect pitch ( because I am lazy ) , but if you have listened to a lot of scales over time you begin to learn what each sounds like - usually if a song is in a minor key ( and most are ) you \'ll know immediately that it is minor or major . From there , I will pick several pitches ( either from sequence or chord - music composition has several rules about how you can move and still \' sound good \' ) and then reconstruct a scale . I \'ll use a piano to play notes until I find one that is in the scale , then reconstruct the scale . Alternatively , you can use digital equipment ( eg a digital tuner ) to determine precisely the pitch of what is being played , and then you know the notes by the readout on the screen .', 'For BPM : Songs , especially dance songs , will have a steady beat . A beat is a "" da "" if you were singing "" da da da da "" along with the song . E.G. "" Mary had a little lamb "" - > "" Ma - ry - had - a - lit - le - lamb-(pause ) "" - > da - da - da - da - da - da - da-[da ( pause , not said ) ] . The BPM is the time between each da . So really fast songs go dadadada , where a really slow song might go . Software can look for patterns and emphasized sounds ( which is usually a bass hit or a drum repeating every so often in dance music ) and use these to figure out the "" da""s . Note songs can change BPMS midway and can do two "" de""s in the space of one "" da "" to make it more exciting .', ""To figure out a key of a song , it 's mainly by ear . I 'm sure there is computer software that can analyze the frequencies of music and determine the notes played , but an everyday artist will most likely go by ear when transposing a song they hear into whatever instrument part they want . For example , when I want to transpose lyrics into keyboard notes , I sing the music ( this requires lots of voice practice to match the singer ) into a tuner which tells me exactly what note I 'm singing .""]",0
"How do you find reasonably priced, quality, long lasting clothing?","[""There are a few strategies you can try to find reasonably priced, quality, long-lasting clothing:Shop secondhand: One way to find good quality clothing at a lower price is to shop secondhand. There are many thrift stores, consignment stores, and online marketplaces that sell gently used clothing at a fraction of the original cost.Look for sales and discounts: Many retailers offer sales and discounts throughout the year, so it can be worth waiting for a sale to make a purchase. You can also sign up for email newsletters or follow your favorite stores on social media to stay updated on their sales and promotions.Choose timeless styles: Instead of following the latest trends, consider investing in timeless, classic styles that will never go out of fashion. These types of clothes may cost a bit more upfront, but they will last longer and be worth the investment in the long run.Care for your clothing properly: Proper care can extend the life of your clothing. Make sure to follow the care instructions on your clothes, and be gentle with them when washing and drying. Avoid drying clothes on high heat, as it can cause shrinkage and damage.Shop at higher-end stores: While higher-end stores may have higher prices, they often carry higher-quality clothing that will last longer.

How do you go about buying a house directly from an owner? I.e. no broker involved?,"[""You don't have to use an agent (broker, as you call it), but it is strongly advised. In some counties lawyers are required, in some not. Check your local requirements. Similarly the escrow companies that usually deal with recording and disbursing of money. You will probably not be able to get a title insurance without using an escrow service (I'm guessing here, but it makes sense to me). You will not be able to secure financing through a bank or a mortgage broker without an escrow company, and it might be hard without an agent. Agents required by law to know all the details of the process, and they can guide you through what to do and what to look into. They have experience reading and understanding the inspection reports, they know what to demand from the seller (disclosures, information, etc), they know how and from where to get the HOA docs and disclosures, and can help you negotiate the price knowing the market information (comparable sales, comparable listings, list vs sales statistics, etc). It is hard to do all that alone, but if you do - you should definitely get a discount over the market price of the property of about 5% (the agents' fees are up to 5% mostly). I bought several properties in California and in other states, and I wouldn't do it without an agent on my side. But if you trust the other side entirely and willing to take the risk of missing a step and having problems later with title, mortgage, insurance or resale, then you can definitely save some money and do it without an agent, and there are people doing that.""]",0

It's important to be realistic and consider the seller's motivations for selling the property.Get a mortgage: If you need financing to buy the property, you'll need to get a mortgage from a lender. You can shop around for the best rates and terms, and be sure to compare offers from multiple lenders.Review and sign the contract: Once you've agreed on the price and financing, you'll need to review and sign a purchase agreement with the seller. This document should outline the terms of the sale, including the purchase price, closing date, and any contingencies.Close the sale: Once all the details are finalized, you'll need to complete the closing process.

You can continue bending it until it is the size and shape that you want.\n\nWhen you are finished bending the copper, you can let it cool down.

A standard deck is 60 cards ( can be more but not less ) and the various types of cards are : Sorcery , Creatures , Instant , Enchantment and Land cards . There are a few more types then that , but we \'re keeping it simple . You draw seven cards to start and one card at the start of your turn . At the end of your turn , if you ever have more than seven cards you have to discard cards until you have seven . Lands are the most basic card . It usually makes up about 1/3 of your deck and its used to power your spells . You can only put one land card into play each turn . Lands are "" tapped "" to draw the power from them and each color of magic has its own kind of land . Forrest , Mountain , Swamp , Plains and Island . Respectively that \'s Green , Red , Black , White and Blue . Sorcery cards are big spells , they can only be played during your turn and they have big effects like player takes XZY amount of damage . Instants are small but fast spells , you can cast these whenever you want * * IF * * you have enough power to do it , even interrupting your opponent . Counter - spell is a famous instant card .

Each player has a deck of cards that represents their arsenal of spells and creatures, and the goal is to reduce the other player\'s life points to zero before they can do the same to you.\n\nTo start a game, each player shuffles their deck and draws seven cards. Each player starts with 20 life points. Players take turns playing cards and using their abilities to attack the other player and their creatures.\n\nOn your turn, you have the option to play a land card, which gives you the resources (mana) to play other cards.

In the case of intracranial injury where you are trying to control intracranial pressure , use of propfol , versed , analgesics , and paralytics are not uncommon .', 'A medically induced coma is similar to general anesthesia . There are three components to general anesthesia : - sedation ( making you unconscious ) - anesthesia ( keeping you from feeling pain ) - relaxation ( relaxing your muscles ) The last one is used during surgery to prevent your muscles from tensing up or making involuntary movements , but is usually not needed during a medically induced coma .

"" Patients can be sleepy , but react when you address them loudly and/or touch them ( this is usually the ideal state you want them in at the ICU ) .

During anesthesia , sedatives are usually administered through that breathing machine in a gaseous form or as a slow , continous injection . The latter is more common for medically induced comas . The mechanism of action of most sedatives is this : They bind to a certain receptor in the nervous system , the receptor for the hormone GABA , which naturally occurs in our nervous systems and reduces the excitability of our neurons . When the sedatives are attached to the receptors for GABA , they make those receptors more responsive and thus increase the efficiency of GABA .

How do you quantify investment risk?,"[""I use two measures to define investment risk: What's the longest period of time over which this investment has had negative returns? What's the worst-case fall in the value of this investment (peak to trough)? I find that the former works best for long-term investments, like retirement. As a concrete example, I have most of my retirement money in equity, since the Sensex has had zero returns over as long as a decade. Since my investment time-frame is longer, equity is risk-free, by this measure. For short-term investments, like money put aside to buy a car next year, the second measure works better. For this purpose, I might choose a debt fund that isn't the safest, and has had a worst-case 8% loss over the past decade. I can afford that loss, putting in more money from my pocket to buy the car, if needed. So, I might choose this fund for this purpose, taking a slight risk to earn higher return. In any case, how much money I need for a car can only be a rough guess, so having 8% less than originally planned may turn out to be enough. Or it may turn out that the entire amount originally planned for is insufficient, in which case a further 8% shortfall may not be a big deal. These two measures I've defined are simple to explain and understand, unlike academic stuff like beta, standard deviation, information ratio or other mumbo-jumbo. And they are simple to apply to a practical problem, as I've illustrated with the two examples above. On the other hand, if someone tells me that the standard deviation of a mutual fund is 15%, I'll have no idea what that means, or how to apply that to my financial situation. All this suffers from the problem of being limited to historical data, and the future may not be like the past. But that affects any risk statistic, and you can't do better unless you have a time machine.""]",0
How do you quantify investment risk?,"[""There are a number of ways to quantify investment risk, including:Standard deviation: This is a statistical measure that shows how much the returns of an investment fluctuate over time. A higher standard deviation indicates a higher level of risk, as the returns are more unpredictable.Beta: This is a measure of the volatility of an investment relative to the overall market. A beta of 1 indicates that the investment is as volatile as the market, while a beta less than 1 indicates that it is less volatile, and a beta greater than 1 indicates that it is more volatile.Value at Risk (VaR): This is a statistical measure that estimates the maximum loss that an investment could incur over a given time period with a certain level of confidence. For example, a VaR of 10% over a one-year period means that there is a 10% chance that the investment will lose more than the estimated amount over that period.Sharpe ratio: This is a measure of the return of an investment relative to its risk. It is calculated by dividing the excess return (the return of the investment above the risk-free rate) by the standard deviation of the investment's returns. A higher Sharpe ratio indicates a better risk-to-return trade-off.Maximum drawdown: This is the maximum loss that an investment has experienced over a given time period. It can be used to measure the risk of an investment by showing how much it has lost during its worst period.It is important to note that these measures are not mutually exclusive and can be used in combination to get a more comprehensive understanding of the risk profile of an investment."", ""There are several ways to quantify investment risk, including:Standard Deviation: Standard deviation is a statistical measure that calculates the level of variation or dispersion in a set of data.

How do you report S-corporation Shareholder loans / capital contributions?,"[""As the owner of the S-corp, it is far easier for you to move money in/out of the company as contributions and distributions rather than making loans to the company. Loans require interest payments, 1099-INT forms, and have tax consequences, whereas the distributions don't need to be reported because you pay taxes on net profits regardless of whether the money was distributed. If you were paid interest, disregard this answer. I don't know if or how you could re-categorize the loan once there's a 1099-INT involved. If no interest was ever paid, you just need to account for it properly: If the company didn't pay you any interest and never issued you a 1099-INT form (i.e. you wrote a check to the company, no promissory note, no tax forms, no payments, no interest, etc.) then you can categorize that money as a capital contribution. You can likewise take that money back out of the company as a capital distribution and neither of these events are taxable nor do they need to be reported to the IRS. In Quickbooks, create the following Equity accounts -- one for each shareholder making capital contributions and distributions: When putting money into the company, deposit into your corporate bank account and use the Capital Contribution equity account. When taking money out of the company, write yourself a check and use the Distributions account. At the end of every tax year, you can close out your Contributions and Distributions to Retained Earnings by making a general journal entry. For example, debit retained earnings and credit distributions on Dec 31 every year to zero-out the distributions account. For contributions, do the reverse and credit retained earnings. There are other ways of recording these transactions -- for example I think some people just use a Member Capital equity account instead of separate accounts for contributions and distributions -- and QB might warn you about posting journal entries to the special Retained Earnings account at the end of the year. In any case, this is how my CPA set up my books and it's been working well enough for many years. Still, never a bad idea to get a second opinion from your CPA. Be sure to pay yourself a reasonable salary, you can't get out of payroll taxes and just distribute profits -- that's a big red flag that can trigger an audit. If you're simply distributing back the money you already put into the company, that should be fine.""]",0
How do you report S-corporation Shareholder loans / capital contributions?,"[""S-corporation shareholder loans and capital contributions should be reported on the shareholder's personal tax return and on the S-corporation's tax return.On the shareholder's personal tax return, the shareholder should report any loans received from the S-corporation as taxable income.

How do you restore old black and white photos to color ? The post ' History to Color ' prompted my curiosity . How do you know it 's the right colors?~ Please explain like I'm five.,"['Restoring old black and white photos to color is a process called colorization. It involves adding color to a black and white photo using digital software. There are a few different ways to do this. One method is to use a software tool that allows you to ""paint"" the colors onto the photo manually. This can be a time-consuming process, but it allows you to be very precise and make sure that the colors you are adding are accurate. Another method is to use a software tool that automatically colorizes the photo for you. This can be a faster process, but the results may not be as accurate as doing it manually. To determine the right colors for a black and white photo, you can use a variety of sources as reference. These might include: 1. Other photos of the same subject or location that are already in color. 2. Historical records or documents that describe the colors of objects or clothing. 3. Your own knowledge and memories of what the subject or location looked like at the time the photo was taken. Regardless of which method you use, it\'s important to be mindful of the limitations of colorization. It\'s not always possible to accurately restore a black and white photo to its original colors, especially if the photo is old or damaged. In these cases, it\'s best to be as faithful as possible to the available sources and to make the colorization as realistic as possible.']",1
"How do you safely get rid of nuclear waste ? Please do n't use words with over 7 letters , those are too hard . Explain like I'm five.","['\\nGetting rid of nuclear waste safely is a very complex and important task. Nuclear waste is the material that is left over after nuclear fuel has been used in a nuclear power plant or other type of nuclear facility. It is highly radioactive and can be dangerous to people and the environment if it is not properly handled and disposed of.\\n\\nThere are several ways to get rid of nuclear waste safely, and the method that is used depends on the type of waste and the regulations in the country where the waste is being disposed of. Here are a few examples of how nuclear waste is safely disposed of:\\n\\nBurying it in the ground: One way to get rid of nuclear waste is to bury it in the ground in a special container called a ""drum."" The drum is made of thick, strong material that can hold the waste and keep it from escaping. The drum is then placed in a hole in the ground and covered with dirt.\\n\\nStoring it in a special facility: Another way to get rid of nuclear waste is to store it in a special facility called a ""repository."" A repository is a building or underground storage area that is designed specifically for storing nuclear waste. The waste is placed in special containers and stored in the repository until it can be safely disposed of.\\n\\nSending it to another country: In some cases, nuclear waste may be sent to another country where it can be safely disposed of. This is usually done by shipping the waste in special containers on a boat or plane. The waste is then delivered to the other country and disposed of according to the laws and regulations of that country.\\n\\nOverall, there are several ways to get rid of nuclear waste safely, including burying it in the ground, storing it in a special facility, or sending it to another country. It is important to follow proper procedures and use special equipment to ensure that the waste is handled and disposed of safely.\\n']",1

The current way to dispose is to place the waste into a cooling pool for several years , then dump it in a steel barrel and store it on the nuclear power plant parking lot .

How do you sail into the wind ? Watching the Olympic sailing reignited my curiosity . I understand the boat zig - zags into a headwind but how do they generate movement in the opposite direction of the wind by doing this ? Explain like I'm five.,"['Sailing into the wind, also called sailing close-hauled, is when a boat is sailing as close as possible to the direction from which the wind is coming. To do this, the boat must sail at an angle to the wind, rather than directly into it.\n\nTo understand how this works, imagine that you are holding a piece of paper in your hand. If you blow on the paper, it will move in the direction that you are blowing. This is because the wind is pushing against the paper and causing it to move.\n\nNow imagine that you take that same piece of paper and hold it at an angle to your mouth, so that the wind is blowing against one side of the paper but not the other. If you blow on the paper, it will still move, but it will move in a different direction than if you had held it straight. This is because the wind is pushing against one side of the paper more than the other, causing it to tilt and move in a different direction.\n\nSailing a boat is similar to this. When the wind is blowing against the sails of a boat, it causes the boat to move in the direction that the wind is coming from. However, if the boat is sailed at an angle to the wind, the wind will push against one side of the sails more than the other, causing the boat to tilt and move in a different direction.\n\nSo, to sail into the wind, a boat must sail at an angle to the wind, rather than directly into it. This allows the wind to push against the sails and move the boat in the desired direction, even though it is sailing against the wind.']",1
How do you sail into the wind ? Watching the Olympic sailing reignited my curiosity . I understand the boat zig - zags into a headwind but how do they generate movement in the opposite direction of the wind by doing this ? Explain like I'm five.,"[""It 's because of the shape of the sail and the keel of the boat . Up until maybe the 18th or 19th century , sailboats used big sails that were perpendicular to the wind . These are the big square sails you see in pirate movies , that go left and right . They work in a simple manner , the wind blows and pushes them . For a given wind direction , you have a 90 degree arc to the leeward ( away from the wind ) that you are able to sail in , but you ca n't sail anywhere in the other 270 degrees . For instance , a northern wind allows you to go southwest , south , or southeast . Modern sailboats have triangular sails , mounted so they go forwards and backwards along the boat . These work the same was as an airfoil in an airplane - the air pressure on the sail is different on either side due to the curvature of the sail , and that allows the boat to move . Because the boat has a keel ( a big fin on the bottom ) , it wo n't be pushed over to the side when it is sailing perpendicular to the wind . These boats have a 90 degree arc that they ca n't sail in , and are fastest when moving perpendicular to the wind . Our new boat with a northern wind can now go northwest , west , southwest , south , southeast , east , or northeast , and is fastest going west or east . Now , when a modern sailboat is sailing downwind , it 's actually the slowest , because they need to just let the sail out and get blown downwind like an ancient sailboat . Going perpendicular or into the wind allows them to benefit from their sail configuration . It does tilt the boat quite a bit when you 're going sideways in relation to the wind , which is why you 'll see sail crews all hang over the railing of the upwind side , to balance the boat from tipping over . Now , you 've still got a 90 degree arc into the wind that you ca n't go ( due north , per our last example ) , so you use a technique called tacking . When tacking , you 'll sail northeast , then make a northwest turn and sail that direction , then turn northeast again , in sort of a zig zag pattern that lets you make an overall movement towards the wind . This is the most challenging part of sailing , as you need to turn across the wind , and the crew needs to quickly scramble to the other side ."", ""It 's called tacking . Jibing is when you zig zag in the same direction as the wind . Essentially , since the sail can not catch wind at a 90 degree angle to the boat and still propel it , the boat must zigzag to catch wind ."", '[ Physics of Sailing ] ( URL_0 ) A nice simple video showing how sailing works !']",0
"How do you secure a prosthetic limb without causing gangrene ? I understand that with human prosthetics you can take them off freely , but with animals I would assume the prosthetic needs to be permanent . Please explain like I'm five.","[""Securing a prosthetic limb for an animal involves a few different steps. Here is a simple explanation of the process:The animal's amputated limb is typically cleaned and treated to prevent infection.The prosthetic limb is then custom-made to fit the animal's size and shape.The prosthetic is attached to the animal's remaining limb using a special socket, which is designed to fit snugly around the stump.The socket is secured to the stump using straps or other fastening devices.The animal is then trained to use the prosthetic limb, which may involve physical therapy and exercises to help the animal get used to the new limb.It is important to make sure that the prosthetic limb fits properly and is secured correctly to avoid causing gangrene or other complications. Gangrene is a serious condition that can occur when blood flow is cut off to a limb, leading to tissue death and potentially life-threatening infections. By properly fitting and securing the prosthetic limb, the animal's risk of developing gangrene can be greatly reduced.""]",1
"How do you secure a prosthetic limb without causing gangrene ? I understand that with human prosthetics you can take them off freely , but with animals I would assume the prosthetic needs to be permanent . Please explain like I'm five.","[""It depends on the size of the animal . Horses , for example , have been fitted with prosthetics similar to humans ( the sock and sleeve type ) . Lighter animals like cats can have permanent prosthetics because the weight distribution is different on the prosthetic . The way it heals is like when we have implants to fix bones . Basically , a metal peg is implanted in the bone and the skin heals so that the peg sticks out ( like a fistula around a piercing ) and the limb is then attached to the peg . Now , I 'm not a professional , this is all based on being around vets doing various surgeries . The two cases I 'm thinking of are these : Horse : URL_2 Cat : URL_1 Edit : this kind of explains how metal implants can heal without infection when the stick out of the skin . URL_0"", 'So I \'m a medical doctor who works with a large amputee population and prescribes a ton of prosthetic devices -- obviously I ca n\'t speak for the vetmed perspective but I \'m sure many of the same principles apply . Skin care is actually one of the biggest challenges in amputee care . In America , the vast majority of amputations are due to vascular disease and diabetes . Most of these patients are older , have poor wound healing from their disease , and may have impaired sensation . A residual limb(stump ) in a prosthetic limb also can become very moist from sweat , which further contributes to skin breakdown . Even young , healthy people who had a traumatic amputation(rather than from vascular disease ) , skin care can be challenging and limit use of their prosthesis . Therefor , prevention is key . We look to maximize the capabilities of both the residual limb and the device . From the moment a surgeon decides(or is forced ) to amputate , skin and soft tissue safety are considered . We know that transtibial(below knee ) amputations do better if they are shaped cylindricallry , while a transfemoral(above knee ) does better if shaped conically . This is because we know through years of experience which areas are prone to breakdown and this way we can reliably predict what the areas of concern will be . At or after the time of surgery , the surgeon will often perform a procedure where extra soft tissue(muscle ) is pulled over pressure sensitive areas to give additional padding . The prosthetic socket and sleeve need to be a nice , snug fit to prevent "" pistoning "" in and out of the leg and irritating the skin . We use drying agents and botox injections to prevent excess moisture in the area . Every time an amputee comes in my office , I do a thorough skin check because a small area of irritation now can become a big problem later . Once you get past the point of a small area of irritation , healing the skin becomes much more challenging and can result in horrible complications - including need for a higher level amputation , loss of ability to walk , or even death .', 'Vet here . In dogs and cats , prosthetics are not common at all . There has been some experimentation . There was a cat with prosthetic back feet that attached at the level of the ankle . What they did was place a metal pin that sticks into the shin bone , and then there was a ring of mesh - like material that they sutured to the skin , and the skin grew into the mesh to create a sealed continuum between the implant prosthetic and biologic tissue .']",0

Pinyin : This is the standard romanization for the PRC where characters are written in the Latin alphabet . Like /u / kabajingai said , you can type the entire romanization out to get your desired word . However , this is pretty time - consuming , so most people usually remove the tone numbers when typing . You can go even further and shorten a word like 朋友 , peng2you5 ( friend ) to just "" py "" because "" py "" is not a valid syllable so the system recognizes it as an abbreviation . 2 . Zhuyin / Bopomofo : This system was used in China before the standard Latin phonetic transcription came about in the 1950s , but now it is only used in Taiwan . It functions in the same as pinyin , but instead of Latin letters , you have distorted Chinese characters that almost resemble Japanese katakana . Each symbol represents a specific morpheme , and tonal marks similar to those in pinyin are used to represent the tones . 3 . Wubihua : The first two systems were phonetically - based , but this one is handwriting - based . All Chinese characters have a standard stroke order ( order of the lines you have to draw to make the character ) , and there are only five buttons in this system you can press to get your desired character . There are ~34 types of strokes in Chinese , but some of them are very similar to each other , so Wubihua classifies the 34 strokes into either a horizontal , vertical , falling to the left , falling to the right / dots , and turning strokes ( which are a combination of any of the previously four as long as you do n\'t lift the pencil when writing ) . 4 . Wubi and Cangjie : These are also writing - based , but instead use the radicals that make up the characters . These are more complicated to learn as a beginner because the rules and algorithms might seem a bit strange at first . Cangjie is based on geometrical distribution , and I am not familiar with the typing at all , so do n\'t ask me about it . Wubi is simpler imo because it is purely based on radicals and strokes . It \'s like a faster Wubihua where common stroke orders that might take six keyboard presses are transformed into one keyboard press . 5 . Drawing : And of course , you can actually draw the character on the screen if your phone supports it . I like this way better because my handwriting is faster than typing , and it \'s neat enough that my phone can register what the hell I \'m typing . Usually when you draw , the character will be distorted from what your computer - written fonts look like , cause messy handwriting and stuff .', 'There is way to read and spell Chinese characters .

How do zits / pimples actually form on your face ? Why are they suddenly there ? Why are some bigger than others ? Please explain like I'm five.,"[""Acne is a common skin condition that occurs when the hair follicles on your skin become clogged with oil and dead skin cells. The clogged pores can become infected with bacteria, and this can cause a pimple or zit to form. Pimples are also called zits, spots, or blemishes. \nPimples can form on any part of your body, but they are most common on the face, neck, chest, and back. They can range in size from very small to large and can be red, white, or black in color. Some pimples are painful, while others are not. \nThere are many different things that can cause pimples to form. Some common triggers include: \nHormonal changes: Pimples are common during puberty when the body's hormones are changing. Hormonal changes can also cause pimples to form in adults.\nGenetics: If your parents had acne, you are more likely to develop acne as well.\nDiet: Some people find that certain foods, such as chocolate or fried foods, can trigger pimples.\nSkin care products: Some skincare products can irritate the skin and cause pimples to form.\nStress: Stress can affect the body's hormone levels and can cause pimples to form. \nPimples can be treated with over-the-counter or prescription medications, such as creams or gels that contain benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid. It is important to keep the skin clean and to avoid picking or squeezing pimples, as this can cause them to become infected or leave scars.""]",1

How do “held” amounts appear on statements and affect balances of traditional credit cards?,"['The ""hold"" is just placeholder that prevents you from overspending until the transaction is settled. The merchant isn\'t ""holding"" your money, your bank or card provider is protecting itself from you overdrawing. In general, it takes 1-3 days for a credit transaction to settle. With a credit card, this usually isn\'t an issue, unless you have a very low credit line or other unusual things going on. With pre-paid and debit cards, it is an issue, since your spending power is contingent upon you having an available balance. I\'m a contrarian on this topic, but I don\'t see any compelling reason to use debit or stored value cards, other than preventing yourself from overspending.

How do “held” amounts appear on statements and affect balances of traditional credit cards?,"[""When you use a traditional credit card to make a purchase, the merchant may place a hold on your account for the amount of the transaction. This means that the funds will be temporarily set aside in your account and will not be available for you to use until the transaction is completed. The hold will appear on your credit card statement as a pending transaction.The purpose of the hold is to ensure that the merchant has the funds available to complete the transaction. For example, if you use your credit card to pay for a hotel room, the hotel may place a hold on your account for the full amount of your stay, even if you only use the card to pay for one night. This is to protect the hotel in case you decide to stay longer or incur additional charges.The hold will typically be released a few days after the transaction is completed, at which point the funds will be made available for you to use again. The hold will also be released if the transaction is cancelled or if it is not completed for any reason.It's important to note that the hold will affect your available credit and may cause your balance to go over your credit limit. However, the hold will not be reflected in your balance until the transaction is completed and the funds are actually transferred from your account.""]",1

"How does "" fracking "" cause earthquakes ? I keep seeing in the news of earthquakes blames on fracking , especially in Oklahoma . Is this cause / effect proven , is it a theory , and how does it happen ? Please explain like I'm five.","['Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, is a process used to extract oil and natural gas from shale rock formations. It involves injecting a mixture of water, sand, and chemicals into the ground at high pressure to create small fractures, or cracks, in the rock. This allows oil and gas to flow more easily out of the rock and into the well. While fracking has been successful in increasing the supply of oil and natural gas, it has also been linked to an increase in earthquakes in some areas. These earthquakes are usually small and do not pose a significant risk to people, but they can be felt by people living nearby. The cause of these earthquakes is not fully understood, but it is thought that the injection of water and other fluids into the ground during fracking can cause the ground to shift and move, leading to earthquakes. Some scientists believe that these earthquakes may also be related to the disposal of waste water from the fracking process, which is often injected back into the ground. Overall, the relationship between fracking and earthquakes is still being studied, and more research is needed to understand the full extent of this connection.']",1

When you write a program, you write a set of instructions that tell the computer what to do. For example, you might tell the computer to open a file, read the information in it, and then print the information out on the screen. Or you might tell the computer to do math problems, like adding up a list of numbers. To write a program, you type your instructions into a computer using a text editor. Then, you save the file and run the program. The computer reads your instructions and follows them, step by step. Programming is a really useful skill because it allows you to make your computer do things that you want it to do. It can be a little bit tricky to learn at first, but with practice and patience, you'll get the hang of it!""]",1
"How does "" programming "" work ? I want to be better in the subject "" computer and technical stuff "" . When you know something interesting , please explain it to me ! Thanks ! ( Sorry for my english . ) Explain like I'm five.","['A program is just a bunch of very simple instructions for doing something . A programming language lets you say how to do something complicated in terms of several simple steps — including steps that are repeated ( "" loops "" ) and steps where you might decide which of two or more things to do ( "" conditionals "" ) . For instance , suppose you are programming a little robot that can move around on a piece of paper . The robot has a pen in its belly , so it draws a line wherever it goes . You would like to get the robot to draw a square . But all it knows how to do is * go forward or back by some number of inches * , and * turn left or right by some number of degrees * . So you have to tell it how to make a square out of those moves . You might write a program like this : to draw_a_square forward 2 right 90 forward 2 right 90 forward 2 right 90 forward 2 right 90 end If the robot runs that program , it will have drawn a square , and ended up back where it started . This is , in fact , a program in the language [ Logo ] ( URL_1 ) , which used to be very popular for teaching programming to grade school students . You can find the Logo programming language [ here ] ( URL_0 ) for Mac , Windows , Linux , and other systems . Remember how I said that you can use repeated steps ? You can use these to make a program shorter , like this : to draw_a_square repeat 4 [ forward 2 right 90 ] end That \'s a lot shorter than the earlier program , but it does the same thing . It \'s shorter because instead of repeating instructions ourselves , we tell the robot to repeat doing them . Programs can also take inputs , for instance , telling how big the square should be : to draw_square : size repeat 4 [ forward : size right 90 ] end Or , even , instead of a square , we could draw an arbitrary regular polygon : to draw_polygon : sides : size repeat : sides [ forward : size right ( 360 / : sides ) ] end So , programs can repeat themselves and they can do different things based on their inputs . They can also control different parts of the computer , for instance sending sounds to the speakers or communicating with other programs over the network . But the basic steps of any program are based on making decisions and doing things repeatedly .', 'Computers function off of a series of instructions that come in 1 \'s and 0 \'s ( or yes and no , on and off , etc ) . Combinations of 1 \'s and 0 \'s are the basis for everything that you tell your computer to do . Series of 1 \'s and 0 \'s are convoluted and unfriendly for human users , but they are fantastic for computers . So , people developed programming languages as a means to bridge the gap between what is easy to humans ( writing instructions in an easy - to - read format ) and what is easy to understand for computers ( boolean logic , or 1 \'s and 0 \'s ) . Programming languages can be described as either low - level or high - level . Low - level languages are closer to just writing all 1 \'s and 0 \'s and high - level languages are closer to writing human - readable text . An example of a low - level language is an assembly language and an example of a high - level language is Java or C # . Look at syntax examples of each language to see the difference in readability . For simplicity \'s sake , programming languages then go through a step called compilation that involves parsing the instructions provided in the programming language , tokenizing each piece of the statement , and then making syntactical sense of each token within the larger scheme of the statement . So , the statement : String s = "" foo "" ; gets parsed into the following tokens : * $ 1 = String * $ 2 = s * $ 3 = = * $ 4 = foo * $ 5 = ; After this parsing piece is accomplished , another tool , called a lexical analyzer ( or lexer ) is used to to draw relations between the different tokens based on the rules of the language . So , a java lexer would look at $ 1 and know that it is the beginning of a String declaration . $ 2 would be recognized as a variable , and so on . Once each statement of the program has been parsed and analyzed , it is then translated into 1 \'s and 0 \'s that can be understood by the computer ( or into an intermediary form , such as bytecode ) . The overall goal is to be able to translate instructions that are very friendly for a human to write into something that is very friendly for a machine .', '1 ) You write code in a high - level(human readable ) language . It \'s not english , but it \'s close . Like : System.out.println(""Hello World "" ) would * * print * * the * * l**i**n**e "" Hello World "" to the screen . 2)You write this code into a "" compiler "" . A compiler takes human - readable code and translates it to a lower level that [ most ] humans ca n\'t read . This "" lower level "" is either instructions the processor can directly understand(.exe files ) , or instructions another program can interpret(.class ) . 3)The compiler takes it \'s output(computer readable code ) and turns it into a file the computer can launch like a program .

How does / could cooling air help a jet engine ? Why does cooling air really fast help generate thrust in any way ? URL_0 Please explain like I'm five.,"['The way a jet engine works is basically the same concept of an internal combustion engine : Take air in , compress it , add fuel , ignite , extract energy from the force of expansion . For car engines it is driving pistons to turn wheels , while for jet engines it is spinning turbines which drive fans that push air out the back . If you want better performance you need more air and more fuel reacting . For cars this means higher compression in the cylinder ( which is why higher octane gas is required , as it resists burning too soon under high compression ) , and the same is true for jet engines . But compressing air has a big problem : Heat ! Mashing air with a given amount of heat into a smaller space obviously increases the relative concentration of that heat ; in effect it gets "" hotter "" in comparison . For an automobile engine this heat can result in igniting the gasoline mixture too soon , blowing a piston through the top of your engine . For a jet engine this heat means your engine parts might melt , which is also "" bad "" . How do you get around this ? Use cooler air of course ! You can fly higher for cooler air .. but it is much less dense so you would need to go even faster . Or you can get clever . Air is actually made up of a mix of air molecules of various speeds , which averages to a given temperature . If you could find a way to somehow "" sort "" these molecules you could isolate the slower moving ones and kick out the hotter ones .

So if you compress the air , make it more dense , there 's more air in the same space as your fuel , which makes your fuel way more efficient , since it burns much better . As well , you 're deriving work from the fuel by using it to expand the air rapidly , by heating it rapidly , and by turning your dense liquid fuel into way less dense gas . By compressing the air going in , it already wants to expand back out again , so when the fuel ignites it 's again more efficient at doing the work it 's supposed to be doing . And cold air is more dense already than hot air ."", ""Jet engines operate using the [ Brayton Cycle ] ( URL_0 ) which is a way of handling the thermodynamics of the engine .

How does / could cooling air help a jet engine ? Why does cooling air really fast help generate thrust in any way ? URL_0 Please explain like I'm five.,"[""Cooling air helps a jet engine by keeping the temperature of the engine within safe limits. If the temperature of the engine gets too high, it can cause damage or even cause the engine to catch fire.To understand why cooling air helps generate thrust, we need to understand how a jet engine works. A jet engine sucks in air at the front of the engine and mixes it with fuel. The mixture is then burned, which creates hot gases that are pushed out the back of the engine. The hot gases moving out the back of the engine create a forward force called thrust, which propels the airplane through the air.To create more thrust, the jet engine needs to burn more fuel, which creates more hot gases. However, if the temperature of the engine gets too high, the engine can't burn as much fuel and the amount of thrust it creates decreases. This is why it's important to use cooling air to keep the engine at a safe temperature. The cooling air helps to keep the temperature of the engine down, which allows it to burn more fuel and create more thrust.""]",1

How does 83b election work when paying fair market value at time of grant?,"['The tax cost at election should be zero.  The appreciation is all capital gain beyond your basis, which will be the value at election. IRC §83 applies to property received as compensation for services, where the property is still subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture.  It will catch unvested equity given to employees. §83(a) stops taxation until the substantial risk of forfeiture abates (i.e. no tax until stock vests) since the item is revocable and not yet truly income.  §83(b) allows the taxpayer to make a quick election (up to 30 days after transfer - firm deadline!) to waive the substantial risk of forfeiture (e.g. treat shares as vested today). The normal operation of §83 takes over after election and the taxable income is generally the value of the vested property minus the price paid for it.  If you paid fair market value today, then the difference is zero and your income from the shares is zero. The shares are now yours for tax purposes, though not for legal purposes.  That means they are most likely a capital asset in your hands, like other stocks you own or trade.  The shares will not be treated as compensation income on vesting, and vesting is not a tax matter for elected shares. If you sell them, you get capital gain (with tax dependent on your holding period) over a basis equal to FMV at the election.  The appreciation past election-FMV will be capital gain, rather than ordinary income.  This is why the §83(b) election is so valuable.  It does not matter at this point whether you bought the restricted shares at FMV or at discount (or received them free) - that only affects the taxes upon §83(b) election.']",0

How does AI work in video games ? How can a machine react to human inputs intelligently ? Are there preprogrammed responses to each action ? Does the computer have a set strategy ? Explain like I'm five.,"[""In video games, AI (artificial intelligence) refers to the way that computer-controlled characters (also known as NPCs, or non-player characters) behave and interact with the player and the game world.\n\nThere are different ways that AI can be used in video games, and the specific approach depends on the type of game and the goals of the developers. Here are a few common ways that AI is used in video games:\n\nPreprogrammed responses: In some games, the AI characters may have a set of preprogrammed responses to certain actions or events. For example, an NPC might have a specific line of dialogue that they will always say when the player talks to them, or they might always run away if the player attacks them.\n\nDecision-making: In other games, the AI characters might be able to make decisions based on their surroundings and the player's actions. For example, an NPC might choose to attack the player if they get too close, or they might decide to hide if the player is armed and looking for them.\n\nStrategy: In games that involve strategic elements, such as strategy games or role-playing games, the AI characters might have a set strategy that they follow in order to achieve their goals. For example, an NPC might try to capture certain territory on a map, or they might try to gather resources in order to build up their strength.\n\nOverall, the goal of AI in video games is to create the illusion of intelligent, believable behavior for the NPC characters.

In any game more complicated than tic - tac - toe , this would be overwhelmingly complex . For example , there are 500 billion possible moves in checkers - and most games are far more complicated than that . * * Does the computer have a set strategy ? * * Frequently , yes . Many games use AI that is based on something called a * decision tree * . A decision tree is like a flow - chart that uses the current * state * of the game to make decisions about what an AI character should do next . Here is a [ simple video game AI decision tree ] ( URL_0 ) . Frequently , there is a high degree of randomness in a decision tree , as you [ can see here ] ( URL_4 ) . It may be helpful to see a [ more complex decision tree example ] ( URL_1 ) . * * How can a machine react to human inputs intelligently ? * * Decision trees are just one type of simple AI . Games use a broad variety of techniques to make intelligent decisions . One interesting example from the many different AI systems is something called an [ artificial neural network ] ( URL_3 ) . A neural network is like a digital imitation of the human brain . It begins its "" life "" as a useless bunch of connections between input ( what is currently happening in the game ) and output ( the behavior of the AI character ) . These connections start out essentially randomly , and signals are sent through them from input to output . Between the inputs and outputs , there are hidden points ( nodes ) that require a certain level of input before they will continue a signal from the input side to the output side . For example , one input might be * speed * . Speed might connect to a node that requires 10 mph before it will continue the signal to an output . By changing the required value ( called * action potential * or * weight * ) of that node , you can change the behavior of the system . However , there are usually hundreds or thousands of nodes in a much more complex configuration . Instead of manually changing their weights , a programmer puts in * desired behavior * for a given situation and has the computer replay that situation over and over , changing the weights a little on each replay . The system keeps weights that get it closer to the desired behavior , and discards weights that move it away from desired behavior . In this way , after randomly changing its "" brain "" millions of times and seeing how each change impacts its behavior , the computer can be * trained * to be a good AI for a particular situation . Check out this [ video of a neural network AI learning how to drive ] ( URL_2 ) . Of course , that \'s just one of the many types of AI that video game programmers use to create intelligent behavior .', 'There are a lot of ways to do AI for games depending on what kind of game it is and what the rules are but here \'s a really simple example . In [ tic - tac - toe ] ( URL_1 ) there is a board with nine squares and players take turns filling squares with a nought or a cross . The game ends when one player has three symbols in a row or the board is full . In the first scenario , that player wins and the second is a draw . Since tic - tac - toe is a relatively simple game , we can come up with some really good [ strategies ] ( URL_1 # Strategy ) and even make a [ diagram ] ( URL_0 ) for how to win . In this kind of situation , all you need to do is put the winning moves into the computer and let it follow instructions . But how does this work ? Well , for tic - tac - toe we might use a [ tree ] ( URL_2 ) . Trees are easy to make in today \'s [ object - oriented languages ] ( URL_3 ) like C # and Java . Here , the top of the tree represents the start of the game and you follow branches downwards from state to state as the game goes on . In the picture , the board starts empty and let \'s say the player places an X. The computer follows the branch to the appropriate state and from there it can look down subsequent branches to see what states can possibly come next . At the bottom of the tree will be all the possible end states for the game . Some of them will be kind of high up , where someone gets three in a row and some of them will be nine layers down where the board is full and it \'s a draw . So how do we use the tree to figure out winning moves ? There are , again a few ways you could do it but let \'s stick with the easiest example . Let \'s take a look at every possible \' end state \' in the tree and give it a value depending on whether or not it \'s a good outcome for us . We could put a \' 1 \' on every end state where we win , a \' -1 \' on every end state where we lose and a \' 0 \' on every end state where it \'s a draw . Then all we need to do is say "" the value of any particular state is determined by summing the value of all the states that could come next "" . Let \'s imagine we \'re looking at a state where there are two possible next moves , one where we win and one where it \'s a draw . The win is worth 1 point and the draw is worth zero so the total value of the current state is 1 . We can do this all the way back up the tree until every state of the game has an appropriate point value . Then , when we want to choose our next move , all we have to do is pick the one that has the most points because that \'s the one which has the most chance of ending in a win for us ! Of course , this strategy does n\'t work so well for complex games like chess because there is such a wide variety of moves that the tree gets really big , really quickly - too big for current computers to handle . In that kind of situation we might combine a few different AI strategies and hope for the best . For instance , we could program the computer with some preset opening gambits , some preset endgame strategies and use our tree idea to simulate the mid - game as well as possible , filling in the blanks with our best guess at how much a branch is worth . We can cover the start and end pretty thoroughly because we have more solid facts about them ; at the start everyone has most of their pieces and there are only a few places they can be while at the end people might only have a few pieces to worry about and that simplifies things a lot . The middle is tricky because we ca n\'t really get a good idea of how to weigh short term gains against long term gains because we ca n\'t model every possibility but we might be able to make some educated guesses by estimating the value of the pieces in play and the value of their positions on the board . Of course , this sort of thing is n\'t going to make much sense for bots in an FPS but that \'s a whole \' nother kettle of fish .']",0

How does Anti - cheat systems like PunkBuster or VAC work ? Just wondering how it works and how it can be improved ? Explain like I'm five.,"[""Anti-cheat systems like PunkBuster and VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) work by constantly monitoring a player's game activity and looking for any suspicious behavior that might indicate that the player is cheating. One way they do this is by looking for unusual patterns of behavior that are often associated with cheating. For example, if a player is able to consistently hit shots that are extremely difficult or impossible for a normal player to make, the anti-cheat system might flag this as suspicious activity and take action to investigate further. Another way anti-cheat systems work is by scanning a player's computer for any software or programs that could be used to cheat. If the system finds any suspicious programs, it will take action to prevent the player from using them while they are playing the game. Anti-cheat systems can be improved in a number of ways. One way is by constantly updating the algorithms and rules that are used to detect suspicious behavior. This can help to ensure that the system is able to catch new and emerging forms of cheating. Another way to improve anti-cheat systems is by working closely with game developers to ensure that the system is able to properly detect and prevent cheating in their games. Overall, anti-cheat systems are an important part of the online gaming experience, as they help to ensure that players are able to enjoy a fair and fun game without having to worry about others cheating.""]",1

In the 1980s, Apple Corps sued Apple Inc., claiming that the technology company\'s use of the apple logo and the name ""Apple"" for its computers and other products was an infringement of Apple Corps\' trademark.

How does Bitmessage work ? Because the regular explanation on the wiki is too confusing for me . ( URL_0 ) Explain like I'm five.,"['Bitmessage is a decentralized, secure messaging system that allows people to send messages to each other without the need for a central server or authority. It uses a peer-to-peer network, similar to how BitTorrent or Bitcoin works, to transmit messages between users. Here\'s how it works in a nutshell: A user creates a message and selects a recipient by entering their Bitmessage address. The user\'s computer encrypts the message using the recipient\'s public key, which is a long string of numbers and letters that is unique to each user. This ensures that only the recipient can read the message. The encrypted message is broadcast to the Bitmessage network, which consists of many computers (called ""nodes"") that are running the Bitmessage software. The nodes on the network pass the message along to other nodes until it reaches the recipient. The recipient\'s computer receives the message and uses their private key (which is known only to them) to decrypt the message and read it. Bitmessage is designed to be very secure and private, as it uses advanced encryption techniques to ensure that only the intended recipient can read the message. It is also decentralized, which means that it does not rely on any central authority or server, making it resistant to censorship and tampering. I hope this helps to give you a better understanding of how Bitmessage works! If you have any further questions, please don\'t hesitate to ask.']",1

Because everyone else also shares their unopened chests with you , and if you do n't do this , the chest delivery network wo n't work for long . Suppose if we wanted to secretly deliver the mail for our granny , we just make a chest that only granma can open . We then lump that in with all the other chests that look identical from the outside , and no one could tell I actually made that chest , and that it is going to my ( totally hardcore ) granny . --- So , we all share everyone 's messages with each other ... only they are encrypted and unreadable . We have some keys that we could try to see if any of them is for us . We try them and find out . We forward everything else to other people . We also get encrypted messages that other people have . Since the messages are actually thousands upon thousands every hour , and since we have many users around the globe , figuring out who created the messages is very very hard ( anonymity ) . Finding out who has the key to a given encrypted mail is nearly impossible . The whole network depends on each individual sharing and fowarding other people 's messages so that it does n't rely on each person too much .

This key - pair has an address I create a message going to the public address of another user . The client checks my local database for the public key of that address If it is not found , it requests the public key by sending a message In order to send that message , a difficult cryptographic puzzle must be solved by my client . This takes on average 4 minutes . The completed message and the puzzle are broadcast to all other client over a peer - to - peer network . When the client of the user with the address receives my message , the client sends a second message containing the public key to my address . This requires another puzzle to be solved , and the message to be distributed over the peer - to - peer network . When my client receives the key , it uses that key to encrypt a message , then does another proof of work ( puzzle ) and sends the message . The receivers client gets the message and uses the receivers private key to decrypt the message .', '* * I originally posted this [ here ] ( URL_0 ) * * Well , let \'s start with talking about cryptography for a bit , along with a bit of other vocabulary : * * * Symmetric Encryption * * - This is classical encryption the way most people think of it . A key is used to encrypt data , and then that same key can be used to decrypt it . * * * Asymmetric Encryption * * - Instead of a single key , you \'re dealing with a pair of two keys . One key is used for encryption ( called the public key ) , and the other is used for decryption ( called the private key ) . The keys are mathematically related such that data encrypted using the public key can only be decrypted using the private key . So , as an example , I can give my public key out to everybody , and they can use that to send me encrypted data that only I can decrypt as long as I keep my private key private . * * * Hashing * * - This is basically one - way encryption . You take data , hash it , and get a hash . Hashing algorithms are deterministic , meaning that the same data hashes to the same output every time . As long as the hashing algorithm is secure , then there is no way to figure out the input used to get a given hash without brute forcing . Hence why it \'s considered "" one - way "" . You can take an input can get an output quickly and easily , but not the opposite . * * * Bitmessage Address * * - Essentially a hash of your public key * * * Signing * * - A way to proving that you wrote a message using your private key . Here \'s how that works : You write a message , and encrypt it with your private key ( note , that usually the public key is used for encryption , but in the case of signing , we do the reverse ) . You send your friend the message and the encrypted version of the message . He then uses your public key ( which he already has a copy of ) to decrypt the encrypted portion , and he makes sure that it matches up with the plain text . If the two texts match , he knows that someone with access to your private key sent the message , because that \'s the only way that the data could \'ve been encrypted in such a way that his public key would decrypt it . * * * Proof - of - work * * - Using a hashing function to prove that you expended a certain amount of CPU time . How does this work ? Essentially you need to brute force to find the input that spits out a hash with specific characteristics . If you do this , the network can verify your work easily , by checking your hash , and it shows that you did a certain amount of work . So , now that we have a basic vocabulary , let \'s discuss how Bitmessage essentially works : * Alice and Bob want to communicate with each other over the Bitmessage network . They each create an address ( essentially a public / private keypair ) and they broadcast their public keys to the peers that they \'re connected to . * In this case , Alice wants to send Bob a message . Alice asks for , and gets Bob \'s Bitmessage address . She then uses that to send Bob a message with her Bitmessage client . Here \'s how that goes down : 1 . Using Bob \'s address , Alice \'s bitmessage client asks the network for the public key associated with that address . Why ? Because the address is a hash , and there \'s no way to reverse that process . So instead , the network keeps a map of addresses and their respective public keys . When Alice gets the public key , she can verify that it is the correct one for Bob \'s address by just hashing it , and seeing if it matches the address . 2 . Alice \'s client takes the message , signs it with her private key , and encrypts it with Bob \'s public key , and then broadcasts it over the network , after completing the proof - of - work required . 3 . The peers check the proof of work and then pass the message along until everybody has a copy ( including Bob ) . 4 . Bob \'s Bitmessage client , upon receiving a copy , sees that the message is for him , and decrypts it using Bob \'s private key . It then verifies the signature to make sure it actually came from the address that it says it came from . 5 . Bob reads the message and lives happily ever after . Note : I am not very familiar with the exact nature of the Bitmessage protocol , but this is essentially how it works .']",0

Explain like I'm five.","[""Cancer is a type of disease that occurs when cells in the body begin to grow out of control. These abnormal cells can form tumors and can also spread to other parts of the body.\n\nThere are many different types of cancer, and each type can affect the body in different ways. Some types of cancer can be treated and cured, while others can be slowed down or managed for a period of time. However, if cancer is not treated, it can eventually lead to death.\n\nCancer can kill people in a few different ways. One way is by spreading (metastasizing) to other parts of the body and damaging or destroying important organs and tissues. For example, if cancer spreads to the brain, it can cause brain damage and lead to death.\n\nAnother way that cancer can kill people is by disrupting the body's normal functions. For example, cancer can cause the body to produce too many or too few blood cells, which can lead to anemia (too few red blood cells) or bleeding (too few platelets). It can also cause the body to have problems with digestion, breathing, and other important functions.\n\nIn short, cancer can kill people by spreading to other parts of the body and disrupting the body's normal functions.

Please explain like I'm five.,"['Closed captioning is a way to display the spoken words and sound effects in a television program as text on the screen. It is used to help people who are deaf or hard of hearing understand what is being said on the TV. \nThere are two main ways that closed captioning can be done for live TV: \n1. Manual closed captioning: This is done by a person who listens to the audio of the TV program and types out the words as they are being spoken. This person is called a stenographer or a captioner. The text is then transmitted along with the TV program and displayed on the screen for viewers to read. \n2. Automatic closed captioning: This is done using speech recognition software. The software listens to the audio of the TV program and tries to transcribe the words into text. The text is then transmitted along with the TV program and displayed on the screen for viewers to read. Automatic closed captioning is not always as accurate as manual closed captioning, but it can be done more quickly and is often used for live events where it is not possible to have a stenographer present. \nEither way, closed captioning is a useful tool for people who are deaf or hard of hearing to understand what is being said on TV. It can also be helpful for people who are learning a new language or for anyone who wants to follow along with a program more closely.']",1

And we teach people ( programs ) how to form a line , take only one plate of food at a time , and this makes things more fair and manageable . This works so well that soon we had rules ( like "" please "" and "" thank you "" and asking people to "" pass "" things ) that enabled everyone to SIT at the table and enjoy a nice dinner together . It was great -- as long as everyone knew the rules . But kids do n\'t know the rules . And often , kids ca n\'t understand the rules if you explain them . So the kids keep running into the room and grabbing whatever they want from the table , being greedy , eating from other people \'s plates , causing a mess and creating chaos . So we create a "" kids table . "" ( VMWare ) This is a completely separate table where the children can sit and food is brought to them ( they ca n\'t get their own ) . The kids are allowed to "" be kids "" and do what they want -- AS LONG AS THEY DON\'T LEAVE THE TABLE . This keeps the adult table sane and pleasant , but someone DOES need to check in on the kids every so often . Most of the time the kids are sitting quietly , playing , doing their own thing . Sometimes , though , there \'s a "" Lord of the Flies "" situation and some cleanup is necessary . Docker , in this example , is for slightly older "" kids . "" Kids who are "" ready "" to sit at the adult table . Docker is the equivalent of saying to a program "" you can sit here but you do NOT speak unless spoken to , you sit up straight , eat slowly , no slurping , say please and thank you , do not tell that joke you know ... "" These limitations allow the kid to BE at the adult table , while not really being an adult . It requires a different kind of management than kids sandboxed at the kid \'s table . Not really less or more , just different . The advantage is that it \'s much easier to set an extra place at the table than to set up a whole other table . Edit : I hated how this was written . Re - wrote for clarity . This is , more or less , the technical difference : In vmware , programs are treated like wild animals who must be put in different cages to be fed or they would fight over their food . In Docker , the programs are more like people at a restaurant , who know not to eat from their neighbor \'s table ( or people at a thanksgiving table , who know which plate is theirs ) , and so are allowed to occupy the same room at meal time .', ""How is it different : Virtual Machines engines VMWare simulate a computer inside your computer and runs a full Operating System on it . Docker runs a bunch of processes directly on your OS , and isolate them from the rest of a system thanks to a mechanism called cgroups ( linux only ) . This reduces the performance overhead ( memory , network access ... ) but lowers flexibility ( you ca n't run a Windows application in Docker but you can in a Virtual Machine for example ) ."", ""With VMware , you have a disk image ( VMDK ) that is modified by the operating system of the running virtual machine . In Docker , you have a [ docker image ] ( URL_0 ) , which is kind of like a read - only VMDK . When you [ run ] ( URL_1 ) a docker image , it launches a [ docker container ] ( URL_7 ) instance , which creates a unique , separate read - write layer ( layers are kind of like mini - VMDK 's ) for the running OS to use . Much of the Docker technology relies on features built in to Linux . For that reason , I do n't believe it is possible to run non - Linux containers , and I do n't believe you can run containers on non - Linux systems . The [ OS X install tools ] ( URL_8 ) actually leverage an Ubuntu VM running in VirtualBox . There 's a version for Windows , but I suspect it uses a Linux VM somewhere , too . Part of the appeal of Docker is that it 's very easy to create custom images using the [ build ] ( URL_3 ) /[Dockerfile ] ( URL_4 ) syntax . Docker images are a collection of layers , so you might have an Ubuntu layer , then a Ruby layer , then a layer that includes your webapp . This can all be constructed in a Dockerfile that puts the pieces together . This results in an image which can be used to run containers just about anywhere : your laptop , a server in a datacenter , or on an instance in a public cloud . If the container runs your app successfully on your laptop , you can ship that container to a public cloud and it 'll run exactly the same . Moving Docker images around is more of an ecosystem enhancement than a core technology , but it 's a nice feature . Docker includes the [ push ] ( URL_2 ) and [ pull ] ( URL_5 ) commands that make it very easy to manage images in a central registry . One important difference between VM 's and Docker containers is the scope of executables inside them . VM 's run an entire operating system , and can generally be treated as a server ( or desktop ) instance . Docker containers execute a [ CMD ] ( URL_4 # cmd ) and/or [ ENTRYPOINT ] ( URL_4 # entrypoint ) command when they launch . This means that a Docker container most likely wo n't have systemd , sysvinit , or upstart running by default , and you probably wo n't be able to SSH into a container to see what 's going on . You have to configure a script or application to start the things you want to start .""]",0

The process is called ""dry"" cleaning because it uses no water.\r\n\r\nHere\'s how it works: First, the clothes are carefully examined to identify any stains or areas that need special attention. Then, the clothes are placed in a machine called a dry cleaning machine.

How does Facebook gets income if they offer their website and all of its contents for free ? I suck at economics Explain like I'm five.,"[""Facebook users are n't their customers ; the users are the product . Facebook 's customers are advertising agencies and gaming companies ."", 'Facebook has a three pronged approach to income : facebook credits , advertising , and deals . I come more from the advertising side so I understand that part a bit better . Facebook makes money the same way Google predominantly makes money : through targeted advertising . Facebook allows you to target their ads based off keywords found in user profiles . For example , I used to have to sell a Dexter costume for Halloween . I would obviously target if a person liked the show Dexter , but I also might target Showtime , CSI , and male ages 18 - 34 . These are all sort of related to each other and roughly fit the demographic that watches Dexter . I might even include other Showtime shows like Weeds or Californication to capture as much of that market as possible . Facebook works on a CPC ( Cost per click ) basis so everytime someone clicks on one of our ads , we pay FB an amount of money that is based on what key words are present in the person \'s profile who clicked . "" Dexter "" specifically may cost less than "" Showtime "" which is a bit broader and thus covers more people . The more targeted and minute the term used , the less it generally costs . A term like TV , Food , or Sexy would be so broad that it covers a lot of people , but also costs more per click to use . On the other side , FB also has created "" credits "" which people buy for real money . They can then use these credits to purchase tractors in Farmville , weapons in Mafia Wars , or a limitless other number of online knick knacks found in social games . Facebook takes a cut out of each credit purchased so this is an alternative income for them . The third avenue that is very new for them is in local deal placement . This is essentially just like sites like Groupon or livingsocial . ELI5 : Facebook has three ways to make money . They make money first by looking at what you like . They can then show you ads that are just like the things that you like . So if you say you like Nickelodeon , they may show you a way to go look at and buy posters of Spongebob . Every time you go and look at this other place that sells posters of Spongebob , facebook is being paid by the store owner of Spongebob posters . They also make money whenever you are playing your online games like farmville . When you ask your mom or dad to buy you that super fast tractor or those plants that give you lots of food , your mom and dad have to spend real money to get that for you . They give some of this money to facebook . Facebook also makes money by helping you and all your friends find something fun to do . Sometimes they tell you about a really cool place you might want to try , but you have to get all your friends together first to go there . If you can get all your friends together and all buy a pass to go to this cool place , facebook makes a little money from being the person that told you about it from the place you are going to .

How does GPS work ? How does it know where you are ? Edit : Thanks for the replies now I understand how it works . Explain like I'm five.,"['There are a large number of satellites that are used in GPS . Each of these satellites broadcasts a radio signal that has two pieces of information : the current time of the broadcast and the current location of the satellite . Your GPS device is basically a radio receiver . It listens to the radio signal that is sent out from the GPS satellites . Once it can receive a signal from multiple GPS satellites ( 4 is the minimum ) it can then perform the calculation to determine where you are . The calculation takes into account the position of the satellite , the time of the message , and also the distance from where you are to the satellite . The distance is determined by taking into account the fact that radio waves travel at the speed of light .', 'It does n\'t ! That \'s the cool thing . The GPS ( Global Positioning System ) is a set of 24 ( at least ) satellites floating in space ~~in such a way that they are on what \'s called a "" geosynchronous orbit "" That means they stay over the same spot on the earth all the time because they rotate around it exactly once a day.~~ These satellites just broadcast information constantly . If you have something that can receive these signals it will take that signal and from the signal it can tell exactly how far away this satellite is and where it \'s located . If you can do this to 4 satellites with a bit of math you can tell exactly where you are . So the satellites do n\'t know anything about you , but because they \'re telling you where they are and you can figure out how far they are from you , you can figure out where you are .

How does GPS work ? How does it know where you are ? Edit : Thanks for the replies now I understand how it works . Explain like I'm five.,"[""GPS, or Global Positioning System, is a satellite-based navigation system that helps determine the location, speed, and direction of objects on Earth. It works by using a network of satellites orbiting the Earth to send signals to GPS receivers on the ground. These receivers pick up the signals and use them to calculate the receiver's location, speed, and direction. Here's how it works: GPS satellites orbit the Earth and constantly send signals down to the ground. A GPS receiver, like the one in your phone or car, picks up these signals. The receiver uses the signals to determine how far away it is from each satellite. It does this by measuring the time it takes for the signal to reach the receiver. Once the receiver knows how far away it is from at least four satellites, it can use this information to calculate its exact location on Earth. It does this by using a process called trilateration, which is a fancy way of saying that it measures the distance from the receiver to each satellite and uses this information to figure out where the receiver is. The receiver can also use the signals from the satellites to determine its speed and direction. It does this by measuring how fast the signals are changing and using this information to calculate how fast the receiver is moving. So, to sum it up, GPS works by using a network of satellites orbiting the Earth to send signals to GPS receivers on the ground. These receivers pick up the signals and use them to calculate the receiver's location, speed, and direction.""]",1
How does GST on PayPal payments work for Australian Taxation?,"['Goods and Services Tax (GST) is a tax applied to most goods and services sold in Australia. If you are an Australian business that makes sales through PayPal, you may be required to charge GST on those sales and report the GST collected to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).Here is how GST on PayPal payments works for Australian taxation:Determine if you are required to charge GST: If you are registered for GST and your business has an annual turnover of more than $75,000, you are required to charge GST on your sales. If your business has an annual turnover of less than $75,000, you may choose to register for GST, but it is not required.Charge GST on your sales: If you are required to charge GST, you must charge a rate of 10% on the sale price of your goods or services. For example, if you sell a product for $100, you must charge $110 with $10 being GST.Report GST collected to the ATO: If you are registered for GST, you are required to report the GST collected on your sales to the ATO through your Business Activity Statement (BAS). Your BAS is a form that you use to report and pay your GST, as well as other taxes such as pay as you go (PAYG) withholding and income tax.Keep records of your GST transactions: It is important to keep records of all transactions that include GST, including invoices, receipts, and any other documents that show the amount of GST charged and paid. You will need these records to accurately report GST on your BAS.If you have any questions about GST on PayPal payments or how to report GST to the ATO, it is best to seek the advice of a tax professional or contact the ATO directly for more information.']",1
How does GST on PayPal payments work for Australian Taxation?,"['Regardless of wether or not you are registered for GST, you are legally required to include a GST total on every invoice sent to an Australian customer. This GST total must be 10% of the payment amount if you are registered for GST, or it must be $0.00 if you are not registered for GST. Since all GST transactions with the government are in Australian dollars, this amount on the invoice also needs to be in AUD, or else it\'s impossible for you and your customer to both be working off the same GST amount. This means you need to transfer your money from USD to AUD in PayPal\'s ""Manage Currencies"" area before you can send a tax invoice to the customer, so that you can provide the correct amount in AUD based on the actual exchange rate for the day (and you are required to send invoices promptly). Alternatively, you can collect payments in AUD using PayPal or use a different payment service that collects payments in USD but immediately converts them to AUD for sending an invoice (australian paypal competitors often provide this service).']",0

"How does Google Maps account for size distortion due to the Mercator projection ? So most online maps seem to use the Mercator projection , but say I 'm planning a trip from say , Niger to Germany , would n't the scales of length be really distorted ? Please explain like I'm five.","['The Mercator projection is a way of showing the entire surface of the Earth on a flat map. It is widely used because it is a convenient and simple way to show the Earth on a flat surface. However, because the Earth is not a perfect sphere but rather an oblate spheroid (a sphere that is slightly flattened at the poles and bulging at the equator), the Mercator projection distorts the size of land masses as you move away from the equator. This means that countries near the poles (such as Canada and Russia) appear larger on a Mercator map than they really are, while countries near the equator (such as Brazil and Indonesia) appear smaller than they really are.To account for this distortion, Google Maps provides an option to switch to a different map projection called the ""Gall-Peters projection,"" which shows the size of land masses more accurately. However, this projection has its own distortions and is not as widely used as the Mercator projection.So if you are planning a trip from Niger to Germany using Google Maps, the map will show the correct distance between the two countries, but the size of the countries themselves may not be shown accurately. It\'s important to keep this in mind when looking at maps, and to remember that they are just representations of the real world and may not show everything perfectly.']",1

Some historians believe that it may have been made from a mixture of sulfur, resin, and other flammable substances, while others think it may have contained ingredients like quicklime or naphtha (a type of flammable liquid). One possible explanation for how Greek fire could burn underwater is that it may have been highly incendiary, meaning that it could burn at very high temperatures and was difficult to extinguish. Alternatively, it may have been designed to stick to surfaces, making it harder to remove and allowing it to continue burning even when it was submerged in water.']",1

Naphtha is a type of hydrocarbon that is highly flammable and can burn even when wet, so it is possible that this was one of the ingredients used in Greek fire. Another possibility is that Greek fire was made with a chemical that caused it to stick to surfaces, making it difficult to extinguish. The Byzantines may have used substances like resin or tar to help the fire stick to the hulls of enemy ships, making it more difficult to put out. Overall, the reason that Greek fire was able to burn underwater is because it was made from special ingredients that allowed it to continue burning despite being surrounded by water.']",1

So say we want to have bright yellow , we would it code it like this : FFFF00 which would represent the RGB value 255,255,0 . It is also possible to have an 8 character hex code , where the last 2 would represent the alpha , or transparency , value or the colour .', 'The code consists of 6 digits . Each byte is represented by 2 hex digits - so a colour code consists of 3 bytes of information . And then , the first byte ( first / second digits ) simply corresponds to how much red is in the colour , the second byte corresponds to green , and the last byte ( final two digits ) is the blue .', 'Hexidecimal is another system of counting which is in base 16 rather than your usual base 10 . Where you have 0123456789 in HEX we have 0123456789ABCDEF . F = 15 and when we reach \' 10 \' in HEX that is actually 16 in Decimal . From school you know that in Decimal the columns go 1s , 10s 100s , 1000s etc . Since its 10 ^ 0 = 1 , 10 ^ 1 = 10 , 10 ^ 2 = 100 and so on ... In base 16 we have 16 ^ 0 = 1 so a 1s Column , 16 ^ 1 = 16 so a 16s column and so on ... Now take a hex value like 16AE34 , as someone else already said there are 2 Hex Digits to 1 Byte of information because the max value of 2 Hex Digits is FF which is ( 16 ^ 1 * 15 ) + ( 16 ^ 0 * 15 ) which is ( 16 * 15 ) + 15 = 255 so including 0 gives 256 possible values and 2 ^ 8 = 256 and there are 8 bits in a byte hence 2 hex digits to 1 byte . So now we have 3 values from 0 - 255 in decimal represented as 00 - FF each in Hex . What these numbers really mean is the "" intensity "" or "" amount "" of Red , Green and Blue . In every pixel of your monitor there are subpixels , a red one , a green one and a blue one , lighting them in different combinations creates different colours since from the distance you sit from your screen your eyes can not tell the subpixels apart and will blend them together thereby mixing the R , G and B together to make whatever colour . All of them fully lit gives white and all of them off gives black hence 000000 is black and FFFFFF is white . With this system we have a total of 16,777,216 possible colours that can be displayed in each one of your pixels to make all the pretty pictures you can imagine !']",0

"How does HIV end up becoming AIDS ? If this has already been asked , Please link it in the comments . Explain like I'm five.","[""Sure! HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus, is a virus that can attack and weaken the immune system. The immune system is the body's defense against illness, so when it's weakened, it's harder for the body to fight off infections and diseases.\n\nWhen HIV is left untreated, it can progress and eventually lead to AIDS, or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. AIDS is a late stage of HIV infection that occurs when the immune system is severely damaged and is unable to fight off certain infections and diseases.\n\nTo understand how HIV becomes AIDS, it's helpful to know a little bit about how the immune system works. The immune system is made up of a network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to protect the body from illness. When the body is exposed to a virus or bacteria, the immune system produces special cells called antibodies that attack and destroy the invader.\n\nHIV attacks and weakens the immune system by destroying a type of immune cell called a CD4+ T cell, also known as a T helper cell. These cells are an important part of the immune system because they help coordinate the body's response to infection. When HIV destroys too many CD4+ T cells, the immune system becomes weaker and is less able to fight off infections and diseases.\n\nAs HIV progresses and the immune system becomes weaker, the body becomes more susceptible to certain infections and diseases that it would normally be able to fight off. These infections and diseases are called opportunistic infections because they take advantage of the weakened immune system. When a person with HIV develops one of these opportunistic infections, it's a sign that their HIV has progressed to AIDS.\n\nI hope this helps!

It allows us to make predictions about how things will behave, and to explain why things happen the way they do.\\n\\nIn physics, math is used to describe the fundamental laws that govern the behavior of matter and energy. These laws are based on experiments and observations that have been made over hundreds of years, and they have been found to be very accurate in predicting how things will behave.\\n\\nFor example, math can be used to describe how an object will move if you push it, or how fast it will be going after a certain amount of time. Math can also be used to describe the behavior of light and other types of energy, and to understand the properties of materials and how they respond to different conditions.\\n\\nOverall, math is a powerful tool that helps us understand and explain the world around us, and it is an essential part of many different fields of study, including physics, engineering, and even economics and biology.']",1
How does NASA 's EmDrive work and why is it controversial ? Edit : It 's not NASA 's . Please explain like I'm five.,"['The EmDrive is a type of propulsion system that is being developed by some researchers. It is supposed to be able to propel a spacecraft without the need for any type of fuel. Instead, it would use something called ""microwave cavities"" to create thrust. The idea is that if you put microwaves into a specially shaped metal container, the microwaves will bounce around and push against the walls of the container, creating a force. Some people think that this force could be used to move a spacecraft.The EmDrive is controversial because it goes against one of the most basic laws of physics, which is that you can\'t get something for nothing. According to this law, if you want to make something move, you have to push against something else. For example, if you want to push a box across the floor, you have to push against the floor. The EmDrive doesn\'t have anything to push against, so it shouldn\'t be able to work. However, some researchers have claimed that they have seen the EmDrive produce a small amount of thrust in their experiments, which would mean that the law of physics is wrong.']",1

How does NASA and other space agency ’s manage to land a rover / probe on an moving asteroid ? Title . Explain like I'm five. ,"[""Landing a rover or probe on an asteroid is a challenging task because asteroids are small and often have rough or uneven surfaces. To land a rover or probe on an asteroid, NASA and other space agencies use a variety of technologies and techniques.\\n\\nOne important technology is a guidance, navigation, and control system, which helps the rover or probe to find its way to the asteroid and land in the right spot. This system uses sensors and computers to determine the rover's or probe's position and orientation in space, and to adjust its trajectory as needed to stay on course.\\n\\nAnother important technology is a landing system, which helps the rover or probe to land safely on the asteroid's surface. This might include a parachute to slow the descent, or thrusters to control the speed and direction of the landing.\\n\\nTo land on an asteroid, the rover or probe first needs to be launched into space and travel to the asteroid. Once it gets close to the asteroid, it uses its guidance and navigation system to find the right spot to land, and then uses its landing system to touch down gently on the asteroid's surface.\\n\\nEven with these technologies and techniques, landing a rover or probe on an asteroid is still a difficult and risky endeavor. But by carefully planning and executing the mission, NASA and other space agencies are able to successfully land rovers and probes on asteroids, and gather valuable scientific data and samples from these fascinating and mysterious objects.""]",1
How does NASA and other space agency ’s manage to land a rover / probe on an moving asteroid ? Title . Explain like I'm five. ,"[""We 're really really good at intelligent computer and propulsion systems . There 's four steps to doing it . The first is launching . Got that down quite well with multi - stage rockets . The second is getting to the asteroid and matching its orbit . Got that down quite well with the ability to figure out where the asteroid 's orbit will take it . The third is selecting a spot to land . That can be performed by imaging the asteroid and determining a likely spot . The final one is programming the propulsion systems on the orbiter part to drop its lander on the asteroid . With all the data you 've collected so far , this is also achievable using sophisticated computer - driven propulsion systems with distance - detection measurement devices and self - correcting capability . All of that stuff , we have now . We just need to do a lot of tweaking and testing and solid engineering to make it all work together ."", ""Others have already given the explanation , I just want to address an underlying assumption you seem to be making : You might as well ask how people managed to land on a moving moon , i.e. our Moon . Nothing in space is standing still . Everything is moving in orbit around something else . Our sun orbits around the centre of the galaxy . Our galaxy and the local galaxy group orbit around their centre of gravity . What you want to do is make sure you orbit the centre of gravity ( the Sun , in this case ) at the same speed and with the same orbital parameters that the asteroid does . So it 's like the car analogy that u / Xalteox made : when you 're next to an asteroid at exactly the same speed , you would n't notice that the asteroid is moving . So how do we get to the asteroid ? Very basically ( and I 'll skip the launch part ) , you 're in Earth orbit , travelling a few hundred kilometres above the surface at around 7,700 m / s - that 's roughly 17,000 mph or 28,000 km / h. We need to change our orbit so it crosses that of the asteroid . Timing is important - crossing the asteroid 's orbit when it 's on the other side of the sun is useless . The time where you can burn to intercept is the transfer window . Theoretically , it would n't matter that much , only you would need very , * very * large amounts of fuel , a much larger engine to propel the much heavier spacecraft and maybe several billions of dollars . That 's not feasable , so we wait for the transfer window . Once it comes , we burn the engine for a while until we 're at such a speed that Earth 's gravity can no longer pull us back around . Think of a car on a racetrack that 's too fast to go around a curve and skids off the track - that 's what we 're trying to do here . Only our result will be that we 'll change from orbiting Earth to orbiting the Sun . Once we are at the intercept point ( and hopefully we got everything right and the asteroid is also there ) , we burn the engines again for a while , changing our speed until our orbit of the Sun matches that of the asteroid . And then we do what the other posters said : use thrusters to gently manoeuvre us down to the surface . As I said , this is the very basic version . If you want to try something like that , I 'll shamelessly advise you to download the free demo version of Kerbal Space Program from Steam . Once you 've become addicted to the game like most people ( including me ) , there are mods to make it as realistic ( i.e. very hard ) as home simulations can be , n - body physics and all ."", 'Imagine jumping from one car to another while moving 60 miles per hour . The wind makes it a little difficult to do so in reality , but imagine that the air , therefore wind does not exist . It would be quite simple to jump across , no issues .']",0
How does NAT ( Network Address Translation ) work . I 've googled it and all the answers are very complex . I need it explained to me like I 'm five . Thanks ! Explain like I'm five.,"['Sure! NAT (Network Address Translation) is a way that computers on a private network can communicate with computers on the internet.\r\n\r\nImagine you have a group of friends who all live in the same apartment building. Inside the building, you can all communicate with each other just fine. But if you want to talk to a friend who lives in a different building, you need to go outside and use a special telephone that connects to the outside world.\r\n\r\nIn a similar way, computers on a private network (like your apartment building) need a way to communicate with computers on the internet (like your friend in a different building). NAT helps these computers communicate by acting like a special telephone that connects them to the internet.\r\n\r\nWhen a computer on a private network wants to communicate with a computer on the internet, it sends a message to NAT. NAT looks at the message and sees where it needs to go. Then NAT sends the message out to the internet, using its own special internet address. When the message reaches the computer on the internet, it knows to send a reply back to NAT. NAT then sends the reply back to the original computer on the private network.\r\n\r\nThis way, computers on the private network can communicate with computers on the internet, even though they don\'t have their own internet addresses. NAT helps them ""hide"" behind a single internet address, just like you can use the special telephone to talk to your friend even though you don\'t have your own phone line.']",1

An analogy I \'ve seen used before is the "" postman "" analogy . A postman knows which address to deliver the company \'s mail to ( i.e. the public IP address ) however no knowledge of where it is going internally . Someone in the company ( i.e. router etc ... ) deals with getting the mail to the individuals ( i.e. the private IP addresses ) .', ""OK , so for the sake of example , assume that a packet looks like this : [ Source IP][Destination IP][Data ] Assume your computer wants to open some porn via a web browsing connection .

Barring a whole discussion on that , it 's a * very easy * way , computationally speaking , for a computer to determine if a destination is behind the same router or if i 'll need routing services . In this case , it will need to use routing services . So , it does what 's known as an ARP ( Address Resolution ) request : * [ 192.168.0.2 ] [ 255.255.255.255 ] [ Who has * router IP * 192.168.0.1 ? ] * * Broadcasted on LAN * * * [ 192.168.0.1 ] [ 192.169.0.2 ] [ I have the Router IP , and you can reach me via MAC Address ffff ] * Your computer now knows how to reach the router , so now it fires the porn browsing packet to the router : * [ 192.168.0.2 ] [ 1.2.3.4 ] [ open connection ] * The router , upon receiving this packet , is smart enough to know that it 's a connection request , so first it adds the source , destination and port to something called a NAT table , which looks like this : | Source Port | Destination Port | Local IP | Remote IP | |:-----------|:------------|:------------|:------------| | 96354 | 80 | 192.168.0.2 | 1.2.3.4 | | 88965 | 22 | 192.168.0.3 | 4.5.6.7 | | 12345 | 8888 | 192.168.0.99 | 9.9.3.9 | * Can you guess which row was added ? The first one . I 'll get back to what this table does in a moment . * The router than * translates * the packet and , that is to say , it replaces the Source IP to its own . * [ 24.226.9.23 ] [ 1.2.3.4 ] [ open connection ] * Porn web server then sends back its reply : * [ 1.2.3.4 ] [ 24.226.9.23 ] [ connection OK ] * The router , upon receiving this packet , consults its NAT table above .

Nat is implemented by a device ( a computer , a router , or a firewall ) that has two network connections , one to the internal network , one to the internet . When a device on the internal network wants to connect outside , it sends its messages ( packets ) to the NAT device .

How does Nasa know the exact course to chart with their space probes to get them on different planets ? ELI5 : How does Nasa know the exact course to chart with their space probes to get them on different planets ? Explain like I'm five.,"['To get a space probe to a specific planet, NASA uses a combination of math and physics. They use math to calculate the path that the probe should take, taking into account things like the distance between the probe and the planet and the speed at which the probe is traveling. They also use physics to understand how the probe will be affected by things like the gravity of other planets and the sun, which can affect its course. One way that NASA figures out the best path for a space probe is by using a technique called ""orbital mechanics."" This involves using math and physics to predict how a probe will move in space based on the forces acting on it, such as gravity and the push of its engines. Once they have a good understanding of the probe\'s path, NASA can then use this information to plan the course of the probe and make any necessary adjustments along the way to ensure that it stays on track. This might involve using the probe\'s engines to change its speed or direction, or using the gravity of other objects in space to ""slingshot"" the probe towards its destination. Overall, it takes a lot of careful planning and precise calculations to get a space probe to a specific planet, but by using math and physics, NASA is able to chart a course that will get the probe where it needs to go.']",1

No , seriously , NASA has some of the finest astronomers in the world , who have learned how to perform the complex trajectory calculations necessary to fire a space probe travelling thousands of miles per hour , off of one planet travelling sixty - five thousand miles per hour , towards another planet travelling fifty - four thousand miles per hour ( Mars , for the sake of argument ) . To use a sports analogy , a hockey player does n't pass the puck to where his teammate is , he passes it to the point his teammate will be by the time the puck arrives . NASA is doing pretty much the same thing , just on an exponentially larger scale and using rockets ."", 'Astrophysics -- figuring out how things as big as planets , moons , and stars move -- is pretty much only based on gravity . So the basic problem is : if we have a bunch of big objects and they all have mass and so they all attract each other , and we know where they are and how fast they \'re moving ( and in what direction ) , how do we figure out where they are going to be at any point in the future ? This is called the "" n - body problem "" . For very simple problems we can solve this exactly . For example , if the sun was concentrated into one tiny point ( but still weighed the same ) and the earth was another tiny point and the earth was the only planet , the earth would go around the sun repeating a kind of lopsided circle called an ellipse . But of course it is not that simple . We have two possible options . First , we can pretend that things really are simple , because it turns out the motion is very close anyway . That \'s what we do most of the time , but it \'s not quite accurate enough for aiming space probes and stuff . So the second method is to plug in some numbers and try to calculate how things change over a very short time , and then do it again with the updated numbers , and so on . This is called the numerical method , and it can be as accurate as you want , as long as you are willing to use very short time periods ( the shorter the time periods you use , the more math you have to do : for example , if you did it every ten minutes , you \'d need six calculations an hour , but if you did it every minute , you \'d need sixty ) . So that is basically what we do . We figure out which direction and how fast a planet is going , then we move forward a bit in time and figure out which direction and how fast the planet is going * then * , then we do it again . And eventually we find out where the planet is going to be in three months when our probe is supposed to reach it , and we \'ll know where to aim . One other thing you should know is that there are two main ways of figuring these problems out . One was found by Isaac Newton about three hundred years ago , and the other by Albert Einstein about a hundred years ago . Newton \'s way is easier , but Einstein \'s is more correct , so we usually use Einstein \'s these days when we need to be very correct , like in space probes . Explaining the difference between the two methods is a topic for another ELI5 , though .', 'In addition to what others have said , you also have to realize that these are not "" fire and forget "" missions . Each craft has a set of small rockets on board and enough fuel to make minor course corrections as they fly through space . You do still have to get all of the calculations extremely close at the beginning , but there is some room for error .']",0

How does Netflix acquire and pay for content ? Does watching a show cause that show to get paid more ? How does 8 dollars a month pay for all their content ? Just curious .

Watching a show does not directly cause that show to get paid more.

Explain like I'm five.,"['Netflix pays movie and TV companies to license their movies and shows, which means they are paying for the right to stream the content on their platform. When a company licenses content from another company, they usually agree to pay a certain amount of money for a certain period of time. For example, Netflix might pay a TV network or movie studio a certain amount of money to be able to stream a popular TV show for a year. The amount of money that Netflix pays for a license depends on a number of factors, including the popularity of the content, the length of the license, and the number of people who will be able to watch the content. Netflix also pays more for content that they produce themselves, because they have to pay for the cost of making the show or movie. So, to sum it up, Netflix pays movie and TV companies to be able to show their content to its subscribers. This is how Netflix is able to offer such a wide range of movies and TV shows to its users.']",1

I understand producing their own shows increases subscribers , but does it increase the number enough to fund multiple seasons of multiple shows ? Explain like I'm five.","[""Sure! Netflix profits from producing its own shows like House of Cards in a few different ways.\r\n\r\nFirst, when Netflix produces its own shows, it doesn't have to pay any licensing fees to other companies for the right to stream those shows. This can save them a lot of money, especially if the show becomes very popular and they have to pay a lot to license it.\r\n\r\nSecond, producing its own shows can also help Netflix attract more subscribers. When Netflix releases a new show that it has produced itself, it can promote the show heavily to try and get people to sign up for a subscription so they can watch it. This can help increase the number of subscribers, which in turn increases the amount of money that Netflix is making.\r\n\r\nFinally, Netflix can also sell the rights to its own shows to other companies in other countries, or sell the rights to stream the show on other platforms like cable or broadcast television. This can bring in additional revenue for the company.\r\n\r\nOverall, producing its own shows can be a good way for Netflix to save money on licensing fees, attract more subscribers, and bring in additional revenue from selling the rights to the show.""]",1

In my opinion , this is such a substantial change in emphasis that from the perspective of a lay Catholic , it is not wrong to think of it as a substantial change , even if he is not releasing encyclicals that re - write doctrine . His focus on alleviating poverty might be said to represent a change in his own theology . In his younger days he has very critical of a strain of thought called Liberation Theology which is big in Latin America and has been ( wrongly ) equated with Marxism partly because of its emphasis on God \'s call to work to free the poor from structural injustice .

"How does ROUND - UP work and why is it bad ? I know it 's an herbicide , but I 'd like to know how it works to kill plants . Also , what does it do to humans ? Please explain like I'm five.","[""Roundup is a herbicide that is used to kill weeds and other unwanted plants. It works by interfering with a plant's ability to produce certain proteins that are necessary for its growth and survival. When a plant is sprayed with Roundup, the active ingredient in the herbicide, glyphosate, is absorbed by the plant and disrupts the production of these proteins. This causes the plant to stop growing and eventually die.Roundup is considered bad for several reasons. One reason is that it can be harmful to humans if it is ingested or comes into contact with the skin. Glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup, has been classified as a probable human carcinogen by the World Health Organization. This means that it may cause cancer in humans, although more research is needed to confirm this.Another reason why Roundup is considered bad is that it can be harmful to the environment. When Roundup is sprayed on plants, it can drift through the air and come into contact with other plants or animals. This can have negative effects on non-target plants and animals that are not intended to be killed by the herbicide. Additionally, Roundup can persist in the environment for a long time and can accumulate in soil, water, and other places, which can have negative impacts on the ecosystems around it.In summary, Roundup is a herbicide that is used to kill weeds and other unwanted plants. It works by disrupting the production of proteins that are necessary for the plant's growth and survival.

"How does ROUND - UP work and why is it bad ? I know it 's an herbicide , but I 'd like to know how it works to kill plants . Also , what does it do to humans ? Please explain like I'm five.","['The ELI5 version of this is that it interferes with a plant \'s ability to build amino acids . Amino acids are simple ( well , for organic chemistry ) molecules that are combined to form proteins , which are all of the building materials for life . What makes glyphosate , the active ingredient in Roundup , a clever herbicide is that it only acts on what \'s called the "" shikimic acid pathway "" , which is a particular method of synthesizing these amino acids . It turns out that all animals get these particular amino acids from plants in our diet , so glyphosate has no known ill effects in humans - we do n\'t rely on this particular method for our needs . Why is it considered bad : this is complicated . The easiest criticism to understand is that it \'s way , way overused . Essentially , we \'re raining death on the plant world increasingly more in production agriculture , simply because it \'s so effective . Too much of a good thing . It has a tendency to run off of fields when overused , to the point where we \'ve been able to see it in aquifers and streams far from fields , where , presumably , it could still kill plants in a high - enough concentration . It \'s also greatly linked with Roundup Ready plants , plants which have had their genes modified to be resistant to roundup ( the shikimic acid pathway is modified in such a way as for the glyphosate molecules to no longer be as sticky as they are in non - modified plants , so they ca n\'t gum up the works and prevent the amino acids from forming ) . For those who oppose GMO plants , Roundup is sort of an enabler for the technology . Monsanto , the company which produces Roundup and Roundup Ready plants , has a long history of not being very responsible in a "" big picture "" sort of way ( e.g. Agent Orange , DDT , and PCBs were products of theirs as one of a number of chemical companies providing these goods ) , and they \'ve been known to use monopolistic practices in businesses that harm farmers by squeezing their finances from all sides - providing the seeds , providing the Roundup , and ~~owning the grain elevators that take the grain after its grown~~ * * Edit : it was pointed out to me that Monsanto does n\'t actually own the grain elevators . * * _ Hard to keep track of these sort of things : the agriculture business , like all of corporate America , is full of lots of corporation games . For instance , just parcel out what happened when [ Monsanto merged with Pfizer ] ( URL_0 ) - so far as I can tell , that move spawned 2 new companies as subsidiaries of Pfizer , then a decade later Pfizer sold its controlling interest when things got hairy . Maybe ? Who owns what is hard to track . Mea culpa . _ . Finally , there have been some rumblings that Roundup , or glyphosate more specifically , _ may _ act as a carcinogen in very large enough doses ; the mechanism , as far as I know , is still unknown , but it \'s this last that \'s put it in the news recently . Still , as a herbicide , you ca n\'t get much better than Roundup : it kills plants with no known serious harmful effects on the farmers and field workers who use it .

How does Rebar work in concrete ? I 've always wondered ... ca n't seem to get a good explanation anywhere out there . What is the purpose and how does it help ? Please explain like I'm five.,"['Rebar, short for reinforcing bar, is a type of steel bar that is used to strengthen and reinforce concrete structures. It is made of high-strength steel and is typically placed inside of concrete to provide additional support and increase the tensile strength of the concrete. The purpose of rebar is to hold the concrete together and help it resist the forces that can cause it to crack or break. When concrete is subjected to heavy loads or stress, it can break or crack if it is not reinforced. Rebar helps to distribute the load more evenly throughout the concrete, which helps to prevent cracks and failure. Rebar is usually placed in a grid pattern inside the concrete and is held in place with a special type of wire called tie wire. The rebar is placed in the wet concrete and then the concrete is poured over it. As the concrete dries and hardens, it forms a strong bond with the rebar, which makes the whole structure stronger and more durable. In summary, rebar is used to reinforce concrete to make it stronger and more resistant to cracking and breaking. It is placed inside the concrete and held in place with tie wire, and as the concrete dries and hardens, it forms a strong bond with the rebar, which helps to distribute the load and improve the overall strength of the structure.']",1

"How does Satellite television work ? I mean does the satellite transmit all 600 channels you payed for , or does it just transmit the channel you 're on ? Explain like I'm five.","['Satellite television works by using a network of satellites orbiting the Earth to transmit and receive signals from television stations. When you watch TV, you are tuning in to a specific channel, which is a specific frequency of the television signal. The satellite receives the signal from the television station and then transmits it back down to Earth, where it is received by a satellite dish installed at your home. The satellite dish is connected to a receiver box, which decodes the signal and sends it to your television. When you change the channel on your TV, the receiver box sends a signal to the satellite dish to tune in to a different frequency, and the satellite transmits the new channel back down to Earth. So, the satellite does not transmit all 600 channels at the same time. Instead, it transmits a specific channel when it is requested by the receiver box. This way, you can watch any channel you want, and the satellite only has to transmit the one channel that you are currently watching.']",1

He would select the letters and words he wanted by using a small movement, such as a muscle twitch or a movement of his eye. The device would then speak the words out loud for him. The device used a computer program called ""Equalizer"" that was developed by Hawking and his team at the University of Cambridge. The program was designed to predict the words Hawking wanted to say based on the letters and words he selected and the context of the conversation. Over time, Hawking\'s communication device became more advanced and allowed him to speak with a synthesized voice that sounded more natural. Despite his physical limitations, Hawking was able to continue his research and writing, and he made many important contributions to the field of physics and our understanding of the universe.']",1

How does Value get rounded in figuring out Bonds Value?,"[""The value of a bond is typically calculated by taking into account the current market interest rate, the bond's coupon rate (the rate at which the bond pays interest), and the length of time until the bond matures (the date on which the bond's principal is repaid in full).To calculate the value of a bond, you can use the following formula:Bond value = (Annual interest payment / Market interest rate) + (Bond's principal / (1 + Market interest rate)^Number of years until maturity)This formula takes into account the present value of the bond's future cash flows, which means that the value of the bond is discounted based on the market interest rate to reflect the time value of money.In general, the value of a bond will be rounded to the nearest cent or penny, depending on the currency in which the bond is denominated. However, the precise method of rounding may vary depending on the bond market and the conventions that are followed in that market.""]",1

How does Vanguard determine the optimal asset allocation for their Target Retirement Funds?,"[""Vanguard's Target Retirement Funds are designed to be all-in-one investment solutions for investors who are saving for retirement and do not want to spend time actively managing their investments. These funds use a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments to provide a diversified portfolio that is appropriate for a particular time horizon.The asset allocation for each Target Retirement Fund is based on the expected retirement date of the fund. For example, the Vanguard Target Retirement 2065 Fund is designed for investors who are planning to retire in 2065, and has a higher allocation to stocks (which have the potential for higher returns over the long term) because there is more time for the market to potentially recover from any short-term downturns. As the fund approaches the target retirement date, the allocation to stocks is gradually reduced and the allocation to bonds and other income-generating investments is increased to provide more stability and preserve capital.Vanguard uses a combination of in-house and external expertise to determine the optimal asset allocation for each Target Retirement Fund. This includes analyzing market conditions, economic trends, and other factors that may impact the performance of different asset classes.

The answer is that the optimal risk level for any given holding period depends upon a combination of:  Using these two factors, you construct a risk-averse decision model which chooses the risk level with the best expected average outcome, where it looks only at the median and lower percentile outcomes. This produces an average which is specifically robust to downside risk. The result will look something like this:   The exact results will depend on the expected risk and return of the portfolio, and the degree of risk aversion specified.  The result is specifically valid for the case where you liquidate all of the portfolio at a specific point in time.

How does Yahoo finance adjust stock data for splits and dividends?,"[""When a company declares a stock split, it increases the number of shares outstanding by issuing more shares to existing shareholders. For example, if a company declares a 2-for-1 stock split, an investor who owns 100 shares before the split would own 200 shares after the split. The value of the investor's holdings in the company would remain the same, but the value of each individual share would be halved.To adjust stock data for a stock split, Yahoo Finance divides the historical price of the stock by the split ratio. For example, if a stock traded at $100 per share before a 2-for-1 split, the adjusted price would be $50 per share after the split.Dividends are payments made by a company to its shareholders, typically in the form of cash or additional shares of stock. When a company declares a dividend, it reduces the value of its stock by an amount equal to the dividend per share.To adjust stock data for dividends, Yahoo Finance subtracts the value of the dividend from the historical price of the stock. For example, if a stock traded at $100 per share and the company declared a $1 per share dividend, the adjusted price would be $99 per share.It's important to note that stock splits and dividends can have a significant impact on the historical price data of a stock. Adjusting for these events can make it easier to compare the performance of a stock over time and to analyze trends in the stock market.""]",1
How does Yahoo finance adjust stock data for splits and dividends?,"['Yahoo\'s ""Adj Close"" data is adjusted for splits, but not for dividends. Despite Yahoo\'s webpage\'s footnote saying  *Close price adjusted for dividends and splits. we can see empirically that the ""Adj Close"" is only adjusted for splits. For example, consider Siemens from Jan 27, 2017 to Mar 15, 2017: The Adj Close adjusts for splits: On any particular day, the ""Adj Close"" is equal to the ""Close"" price divided by the cumulative product of all splits that occurred after that day. If there have been no splits after that day, then the ""Adj Close"" equals the ""Close"" price. Since there is a 2-for-1 split on Mar 14, 2017, the Adj Close is half the Close price for all dates from Jan 27, 2017 to Mar 13, 2017. Note that if Siemens were to split again at some time in the future, the Adj Close prices will be readjusted for this future split. For example, if Siemens were to split 3-for-1 tomorrow, then all the Adj Close prices seen above will be divided by 3. The Adj Close is thus showing the price that a share would have traded on that day if the shares had already been split in accordance with all splits up to today. The Adj Close does not adjust for dividends: Notice that Siemens distributed a $1.87 dividend on Feb 02, 2017 and ~$3.74 dividend on Jan 30, 2017. If the Adj Close value were adjusted for these dividends then we should expect the Adj Close should no longer be exactly half of the Close amount. But we can see that there is no such adjustment -- the Adj Close remains (up to rounding) exactly half the Close amount: Note that in theory, the market reacts to the distribution of dividends by reducing the trading price of shares post-dividend. This in turn is reflected in the raw closing price. So in that sense the Adj Close is also automatically adjusted for dividends. But there is no formula for this. The effect is already baked in through the market\'s closing prices.']",0

A one-way encryption is designed to be irreversible, which means that once the information has been encrypted, it can't be turned back into its original form. The reason that one-way encryption is irreversible is because of the way it works. When you encrypt something, you use a special algorithm (a set of steps) and a key to turn the information into a scrambled, unreadable form. The key is like a secret code that only someone with the right password can use to unlock the information. One-way encryption algorithms are designed to be very complex and hard to reverse. This means that even if someone knows how the algorithm works, it would be very difficult for them to figure out how to turn the encrypted information back into its original form.

How does a CFD work behind the scenes?,['There are several ways that the issuers profit from CFDs. If the broker has trades on both sides (buy and sell) they can net the volumes off against each other and profit off the spread whilst using the posted margins to cover p&l from both sides. Because settlement for most securities is not on the same day that the order is placed they can also buy the security with no intention of taking delivery and simply sell it off at the end of day to pass delivery on to someone else. Here again they profit from the spread and that their volumes give them really low commissions so their costs are much lower than the value of the spread. If they have to do this rather than netting the position out the spreads will be wider.  Sometimes that may be forced to buy the security outright but that is rare and the spreads will be even wider so that they can make a decent profit.'],0

"How does a CPU work ? I understand that it processes data , but how what and how does it do it ? Explain like I'm five.","[""The fundamental operation of a CPU is called an ' instruction ' . The operating system ( OS ) feeds the processor one instruction at a time and it performs it . The set of instructions which the cpu accepts and understands is called the ' instruction set ' and is hardwired into the CPU . The CPU goes through this one cycle throughout its life : 1 . Fetch next instruction 2 . Decode this instruction ( i.e. find out what it means / what it wants me to do ) 3 . Execute the instruction . 4 . Repeat Long dull explanation : 1 . Every computer has a CPU and memory ( i.e. RAM ) . An executable file is just a binary file that contains instructions for the cpu . So when you run , say lameprogram.exe , the OS copies that program into RAM , then begins feeding the cpu one instruction at a time . 2 . Decoding : each instruction is basically a binary number ( i.e. 01010110 ) . Each bit of the instruction could mean a different thing . For example , let 's say the cpu treats the first four digits as an identifier to what operation it wants to perform . 0000 : addition , 0001 : subtraction , 0010 : multiplication , etc . The remaining bits relate to what exactly you want to perform the operation on . So perhaps 0010000110 could be broken down into 0010 - 00 - 01 - 10 meaning multiply - register0 - register1 - register2 , i.e. multiply the value located in register0 with the value in register1 and store the result in register2 ( A register is kind of like a memory device located within the cpu which the cpu uses as extremely temporary memory i.e. it 's constantly changing values within them ) 3 . Executing : Inside a cpu , there typically is a device which performs the actual operation . This is called the ALU : Arithmetic Logic Unit . It actually performs the operations that the instruction specifies . 4 . goto step 1 ;) IRL things are 10000x more complicated and advanced , but this is ELI5 , so computer engineers , do n't start ripping apart my post . Also , if you want a more elaborate explanation , read [ this section of this article ] ( URL_0 ) . It 's actually a very good article overall , worth the read . * Edit : grammar and stuff ."", 'There are 2 parts to the working of a cpu , cemc has explained the high - level ( electronic ) part in a really terrific way , but there is also the low - level , microscopic ( electric ) part , the huge array of impossibly tiny transistors and nano - scale wires .

How does a Casino know you are counting cards ? How do they know and prove it enough to ban you ? Explain like I'm five. ,"[""Casinos know that someone is counting cards when they see that the person is suddenly and consistently making larger bets when the count of high cards in the deck is favorable, and smaller bets when the count is not favorable. This is because card counting involves keeping track of which cards have been played and using that information to estimate the composition of the remaining cards in the deck. When the deck has a higher proportion of high cards, the player has a higher chance of winning, so they may make larger bets. When the deck has a lower proportion of high cards, the player has a lower chance of winning, so they may make smaller bets.\\n\\nCasinos can also use other techniques to detect card counting, such as monitoring players for unusual betting patterns or using software to track the play of each person at the table. If a casino has sufficient evidence that a player is counting cards, they may ask the player to leave or ban them from the casino. This is typically done to protect the casino's interests, as card counting can give players an unfair advantage over the house.""]",1

How does a HSA ( Health Savings Account ) work and compare to traditional insurance ? The other answers were n't great and are possibly outdated . Please explain like I'm five.,"[""A Health Savings Account (HSA) is a type of account that you can use to pay for medical expenses. It is often paired with a high-deductible health plan (HDHP), which is a type of health insurance that has a higher deductible than traditional health insurance plans. The deductible is the amount of money you have to pay for your medical expenses before your insurance starts to cover them. With an HSA, you can contribute money to the account on a tax-free basis. You can use this money to pay for qualifying medical expenses, such as doctor's visits, prescription drugs, and certain types of medical equipment. You can also use the money to pay for your deductible and other out-of-pocket costs associated with your HDHP. One of the main advantages of an HSA is that the money in the account can be used to pay for medical expenses tax-free. This means that you can use the money in your HSA to pay for medical expenses without having to pay taxes on it. This can help you save money on your medical expenses. Another advantage of an HSA is that the money in the account belongs to you. This means that you can keep the money in your HSA even if you change jobs or insurance plans. Overall, an HSA can be a good option for people who want to have more control over their healthcare expenses and save money on taxes. However, it is important to keep in mind that an HSA is paired with an HDHP, which may have a higher deductible than traditional insurance plans. This means that you may have to pay more out of pocket for your medical expenses before your insurance starts to cover them.""]",1

How does a Roth IRA work ? My brother 's been telling me about using a Roth IRA and using mutual funds to become a millionaire . Someone wanna help explain what a Roth IRA is and how it works ? Explain like I'm five.,"['Okay , so first let \'s talk about what a * security * is . A security is , in the most generic sense , a thing which you buy today for some price $ X , and which you sell in the future for some price $ Y , with the goal being that Y should be greater than X. It \'s a simple idea : You buy low , and then you sell high , and you end up making money on the deal . One type of security is a * share in a mutual fund . * You know how you can buy shares of stock which give you an ownership stake in a company ? Like imagine you own a company that makes widgets . You can divide the ownership of that company up into pieces , called shares , and then give some to yourself and sell the rest . These shares are securities , in the sense that we defined above : They can be bought , held on to for a time , then sold at a different , and ideally higher , price than what was originally paid for them , because in the time between buying and selling the shares became more valuable . A mutual fund works * kind of * like that . It \'s basically a pool of money which is used to buy securities , but rather than each member of the pool directly owning some of the securities , the securities are owned by the * fund itself * , and the members of the pool own * shares in the fund . * You might buy a share of a mutual fund which owns shares in the widget company we described above , but then sells those shares and uses the money to buy shares in a different company , one that makes gadgets . When those shares in the gadget company have gained in value a bit , those shares are sold and the money \'s used to buy shares in yet another company , this one making thingamagigs . And so on , and so on … but you , as a shareholder in the fund , do n\'t need to worry about any of that . All you need to know is that the shares you own in the fund as a whole are accruing value over time through the wise buying and selling of securities on the part of the fund manager , the person responsible for managing the fund \'s portfolio and increasing its value over time . Of course , the basic rule of buying and selling assets applies to mutual funds as well : You are not guaranteed to make money . In fact , you are n\'t even guaranteed to * keep * the money you start out with . It \'s possible for mutual funds to lose value over time , meaning if you put $ 10,000 into one right now , a year from now your share of the fund might only be worth $ 9,000 . So why would you put money into a mutual fund rather than just putting it into an interest - bearing deposit account , or buying bonds with it ? Because an interest - bearing deposit account or bond investment might , over a year , turn your $ 10,000 into $ 10,300 if you get a good rate … while a mutual fund * has a chance * of turning your $ 10,000 into $ 12,000 in the same time . There \'s a chance for bigger returns , balanced by a chance that you might lose value over time . ( This is pretty rare , though . Most mutual funds are well - managed , and give you returns that are * at least * somewhat better than what you could get from risk - free investing over the same period of time . ) Now the question becomes , how do you go about buying shares in a mutual fund ? Well , the most obvious way is just to walk into the office of some mutual fund someplace and write them a check . But when you do this , you need to know two things . First , the money you use to buy the shares of that fund has * already been taxed . * If you earned $ 30,000 last year and paid $ 10,000 of it in taxes , the $ 20,000 you have left is all you have to buy shares of the fund with . The other thing to know is that in the future , when you cash out of the mutual fund , * you \'re going to be taxed again * on the * profits * you made from your investment . The rate at which those profits are taxed depends on how long you stayed in the fund and how much you made when you got out , but the point is the government is going to take a cut . The way around this is to structure your investment as a Roth IRA . IRA stands for "" individual retirement account "" , and a Roth IRA is a type of IRA ( named for the guy in the Senate who sponsored the law that created it ) . The virtue of structuring your investment as a Roth IRA is that if you follow certain rules , you can get * out * of having to pay taxes on the profit the investment pays you . These rules are pretty complicated , and involve contribution limits — a limit to how much you can put into your investment every year — and seasoning times — how long you have to leave the money in the investment before you can take it out . But as long as you work within those rules , a Roth IRA backed by a well - managed mutual fund can be a really good way to store your money , protect its value against inflation ( by getting a return on your investment that \'s equal to the rate of inflation ) , and make a decent profit for your trouble .', 'Think of a ROTH IRA as just wrapping paper . Everybody who has an income has one box of this wrapping paper labeled "" ROTH IRA "" sitting around . You can put this wrapping paper on pretty much anything you want - Mutual funds , annuities , real estate , etc .

You owe me _ _ _ _ "" But he never seems to notice that this ROTH package gets bigger and bigger . In other words , whatever you decide to cover in your ROTH wrapping paper will grow without ever affecting your tax output . However , it does n\'t help you pay any less taxes on the money you decide to put into it . ( from your paycheck , for example . ) You still have to pay your regular taxes on money * before * it gets put in the ROTH wrapper . SOOO ..... The real question is what are you going to put in your Roth IRA wrapping paper . You * could * put some bonds in there , but you \'ll probably never make it to a million dollars .

The bank takes the money you deposit and invests it elsewhere, traditionally by lending it out to others (hence the concept of a ""savings and loan"" bank). They make a profit as long as the interest they give for ""borrowing"" from you, plus the cost of administering the savings accounts and loans, is less than the interest they charge for lending to others. No, they don\'t have to pay you interest -- but if they didn\'t, you\'d be likely to deposit your funds at another bank which did. Their ideal goal is to pay as little as possible without losing depositors, while charging as much as possible without losing borrowers. (yeah, I know, typo corrected) Why do they get higher interest rate than they pay you? Mostly because your deposits and interest are essentially guaranteed, whereas the folks they\'re lending to may be late paying or default on those loans. As with any kind of investment, higher return requires more work and/or higher risk, plus (ususally) larger reserves so you can afford to ride out any losses that do occur.']",0
How does a TFSA work? Where does the interest come from?,"['A Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) is a type of savings account available in Canada that allows you to earn investment income tax-free. It is similar to a traditional savings account in that you can deposit money into the account and earn interest on those deposits, but the interest and other investment income you earn within the account is not subject to tax.The interest on a TFSA comes from the investment of your deposits. When you deposit money into a TFSA, you can choose to invest that money in a variety of products, such as savings accounts, term deposits, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and stocks. The return on these investments is what generates the interest you earn on your TFSA.There are limits on how much you can contribute to a TFSA each year, and any unused contribution room carries forward to future years. You can also withdraw money from your TFSA at any time without penalty, and the withdrawals do not affect your contribution room for future years. This makes a TFSA a flexible and tax-efficient way to save and invest for the long term.']",1

"How does a TV show make money ? How do viewers make a show money , for example Game of Thrones . Explain like I'm five.","[""Well Game of Thrones is different than most shows because it 's on HBO . HBO makes money by charging individual households a monthly fee just to get HBO , so its pretty direct link from the show to the money . If you want to see an HBO show , you pay HBO for it . Most shows make their networks money by attracting a large audience , and then the network sells advertising time to companies at the time of that show . Bigger audiences = more money to buy advertising time during that show . ( The age range of the audience , gender , income level , etc also all effect advertising prices ... If you 've ever heard of Nielsen ratings they measure all those things as well as the audience size )"", '* For a bright 5 year - old :* A TV show is made by and owned by a * production company * , usually as part of a deal with a * network * who will show it on their channel . The production company pays for making the show . When the show is delivered to the network , the network pays for the right to show it . This payment is called the * license fee * . A * license * is an agreement to use something without owning it . The word * license * actually means "" permission . "" So a TV licensing deal is letting the network play the TV show with permission of the owners . Most of the time , the license fee is less than the cost of the show . TV production companies operate in * deficit finance * which is a fancy was of saying they are losing money through much of the life of the show . On a free broadcast channel , the network makes a profit by selling advertising on the show . They want a good show , so many people will watch it . The more people watch , the more people see the ads , and the more the network can charge for the ads . The production company gets none of the ad money . They get their license fee . But the license fee is usually for permission to broadcast the show only twice . After the second showing , the network does n\'t have permission to show it again . Now , the production company can license the show to a smaller network or a cable company . The real money for the production company comes if the TV show makes 100 or more episodes . Then when the network license expires , the production company can license the show to * syndication . * A syndicate is a group of buyers who pool their money to buy something that none of them could afford by themselves . Like everyone chipping in to buy a pizza . TV syndicates are companies that represent small , local TV stations all over the country who want to license TV shows . The big syndicates cover TV stations in all 50 states . The production company makes a licensing deal with the syndicate , but it \'s actually making licensing deals with 50 - 100 separate TV stations , all paying for a license . How much money is that ? Jerry Seinfeld \'s share of the profits from his TV show \'s syndication deal is said to be $ 250 million . That \'s just his share . It \'s a lot of money . After syndication , the production company can license the show to streaming and shiny disc home video . That can be a lot of money , too , just not as much as syndication . HBO and Netflix do it differently . They are both the owner and the broadcaster of the TV show . They do not show ads . Instead , they charge people to subscribe and watch their shows . HBO and Netflix analyze the cost of the show against the number of people who sign up to watch . Their accountants figure out how much money the TV show is bringing in . Based on that , they decide whether to keep making the show . HBO and Netflix do n\'t sell to syndication . They do sell to shiny disc home video .', ""Most TV shows make money by selling the ad time during the show . So a production company produces a show , pays for the sets , pays the writers , actors , etc . and it costs them , say $ 5 million / episode . They sell the show to a network for $ 6 million . The network then sells $ 7 million worth of ads to run during the show . For shows on HBO or Netflix , instead of selling commercial air time , they sell subscriptions to access the show ... so millions of subscribers pay $ 10 - 20/ month depending on the channel and platform and that money funds the production of the shows . There are also secondary revenue streams , so the numbers are n't always bigger and bigger -- say a production company spends $ 5 million to create an episode , but sells it for $ 3 million . But there are also syndication rights ( reruns ) , international distribution , DVD , streaming services , etc . where they can make more money .""]",0

Explain like I'm five.","[""A Tesla car has an electric motor instead of a traditional gasoline engine. Instead of burning gasoline to create motion, the electric motor in a Tesla uses electricity from a set of batteries to power itself.\r\n\r\nOne of the main differences between a traditional gasoline engine and an electric motor is that the electric motor is much simpler and has fewer moving parts. Gasoline engines have many parts that move and work together, such as the pistons, crankshaft, and valves, which can wear out over time and require maintenance. Electric motors, on the other hand, have only one moving part (the rotor) and are generally more reliable and require less maintenance.\r\n\r\nAnother difference is that electric motors are much more efficient than gasoline engines. When a gasoline engine burns fuel, only a small percentage of the energy created is used to power the car. The rest is lost as heat and noise. Electric motors, on the other hand, can convert almost all of the electricity they receive into motion, making them much more efficient.\r\n\r\nOverall, electric motors are a cleaner and more efficient way to power a car compared to gasoline engines. They don't produce any emissions and require less maintenance, which makes them a good choice for people who want to reduce their impact on the environment and save money on fuel and maintenance costs.""]",1
"How does a Transistor work and why is it so important ? According to a recent ask reddit thread , most people do n't know what a Transistor is , and apparently the transistor is the building block of modern tech . Help ! Explain like I'm five.","['I \'ll tackle the "" why first "" . So , a computer needs to be able to take input and give you output . Whether that \'s deciding what is 2 + 2 or what it should display on screen . Thus , we need a device that translates input to output * automatically * using electricity . I \'ll use a MOSFET transistor as an example , as it is arguably the simplest . There is voltage at one end ( power ) and ground at the other ( somewhere for power to go ) , but the current flow is blocked by the magic of "" chemistry "" . There is an input node * next to * the path we just discussed . It is n\'t on the path , it \'s just reeeaally close by , separated by a small space . When you give that node a positive voltage ( input ) , the pathway unlocks , and the current can flow from the high voltage to ground . Now , how do we use this awesome little device ? Well , you can take a little wire of copper and connect it to the pathway from before just a little bit above the ground node , and run it to a dead end at the input node of a different transistor . This means your first transistor \'s output will determine the next transistors input . You have now created a digital IF ... THEN condition . "" If this happens , then that happens . "" Instead of connecting the bottom of a transistor to ground , you can connect it to the "" power "" node of a different transistor , such that the 2nd is inactive until you give input to the 1st one . Now you have 2 switches that interact with each other based on two sets of input . Mix and match these combos of transistors and you can build "" logic gates "" . AND , OR , NAND , NOR , XOR , XNOR . These transistor networks give a single output based on the combinations of 2 + input . AND : If Bob and Terry want to get dinner , then you will go with them . But if only 1 of them ( or neither ) wants to go , you wo n\'t bother . OR : If either , or both , of Bob and Terry want dinner , you will go . You just do n\'t want to go alone . These logic gates can then be wired together to make more complex things like number adders and decision trees . At that point , you can now control numbers and IF , THEN conditions , so programming is now possible . Hop , skip , jump , and you \'re at your smartphone . Hope that \'s a coherent overview . Source : Electrical Engineering graduate , 2012 . Edit : Thank you for the gold /u / the_cosworth ! I tried to keep the explanation ELI5 - appropriate , but for those wanting more details , there are some great EE explanations in comment chain below this . They go into Bipolar Transistors , explain some of the alternate uses of transistors beyond a simple switch , etc . There \'s also some linked videos in the comment chain below that are excellent little classes on the finer points . Visuals help a ton . I \'ll try to drop a comment about the "" magic of chemistry "" in a bit if anyone still wants to know that .', ""The easiest way to think of a transistor is like an electronic switch . You can turn off the flow of current by applying a much smaller current to the transistor . So imagine the flow of current in a circuit like cars on the street . The transistor is a stop light . When the light is green , the cars can flow . When the light is red , they stop . Because electricity wants to keep flowing , with multiple transistors you can control the flow of electricity and use it to perform simple ( or not so simple ! ) tasks . Imagine a circuit with two transistors . You could set it up so that if one transistor is on , a light lights up , and if both are on , two lights light up . Now you 've made an extremely simple calculator that can only do 1 + 1 . Modern electronics are built off of the Integrated Circuit , which is actually thousands and thousands of extremely tiny transistors on a silicon chip . So imagine my silly little two transistor circuit . If you had many more transistors , you could make it do all kinds of things ."", 'Others did Why to death ( i.e. quite well ) but I \'m going to give a stab at the How . ( TL;DR : : A transistor lets one wire "" act like a knob "" to control how much power goes through another wire . ) So you know how they say atoms are "" mostly empty space "" ? Well there are these particles that are really small ( protons , electrons , neutrons ) but they claim a lot of space around them . All of physics and mechanical science and such is about those "" claims "" and how they interact . What do I mean by claim ? You can get very close to a small fire , and even wave your hand through a candle flame , but if you build a great big bonfire there \'s so much heat that you ca n\'t get close . Indeed , if your fire is too big you end up standing out in the cold because the margin between close enough to be warm and too close to be comfortable becomes unworkable . So particles claim space that \'s larger than themselves . One of their primary effective claims is "" charge "" . We talk about positive and negative charges . It turns out that those words "" positive "" and "" negative "" are pretty much arbitrary . ( Many argue that when Ben Franklin assigned the words he got them backwards , but that \'s another topic for another day . ) So an atom is some number of protons ( positive charges ) glued together by neutrons if there is more than one because , um , that \'s how it works . ( i.e. we really do n\'t know why , at the ELI5 level , neutrons are necessary . ) And for every proton the atom wants one matching electron . This is because plus and minus attract and want to make a big zero . On the other hand , physics demands that there be circles ( or really "" clouds "" ) of electrons around every lump of positive stuff if you want that lump to be stable and happy . The first circle needs to be two electrons , then all the rest of the circles need to be eight . Why eight ? Why the exception for two ? More stuff that \'s true with no good ELI5 reason . That conflict , the push - pull between one - plus - one - minus and two - or - eight is how all of chemistry works . When you see a molecule described , like water , H2O , it might be drawn as H - O - H. The little minuses are pairs of electrons , one from each of the neighboring letters . H , hydrogen , is one proton , so it has one electron , which is not two , so it borrows an electron from the Oxygen so its circle / cloud is two . Oxygen is eight positives , so it has eight electrons . It \'s inner cloud uses two so it \'s outer cloud has six , which is not eight . So it borrows an electron from each of the two hydrogens . But wait ! The hydrogen each borrowed one to make two , and the oxygen borrows two , so What the actual fark , amiright ? The electrons are very fast , so they just leap back and forth , doing double duty . So that line is a very hard , very real connection . It \'s like cheating , but it \'s allowed . Like being stuck doing both the grill and the chili at a barbecue . And that \'s basic chemistry . Now silicon ( and other things like it ) are "" Semiconductors "" . They are n\'t good conductors , and they are not bad conductors , they are just so - so . And so "" semi "" . Meh . ( Note that "" meh "" here is relative . Silicon is _ much _ better conductor than air or plastic , but things like gold and copper are just way , way better . ) And if we looked at a perfect crystal of silicon we \'d see a very ordered set of lines . And being all pure like that it barely conducts electricity at all ( compared to say copper ) . That \'s because each electron is exactly doing it \'s job . So we take that pure silicon and "" dope it "" . We force it to accept some non - silicon atoms . Those atoms have just one too many , or one too few protons , which means there are one too many or one too few electrons . So the resultant block has too many or too few electrons . Too many and the block is negative , Too few and the block is positive . Too many and it "" has electrons ( it can share ) "" . Too few and it "" has holes ( that can accept electrons ) "" . Either way , there \'s now more wiggle room for the electrons to literally skitter around and the silicon is a much better conductor than if every electron has its best spot . So what happens when we mash two of those lumps , one positive and one negative , together ? Well the positive part "" borrows "" the electrons from the negative part and it \'s happy but its now back to being crappy at letting electrons through ... in one direction . There \'s the magic ! If I keep putting electrons on the negative side , it can keep lending them to the positive side , and I can suck them out of the far part of the positive side . But if I put electrons into the positive part I just make it even more impossible for the electrons to move around . It \'s weird , but that \'s a "" Diode "" . Now when that two - part lump is sitting there it \'s inherently a match of plus and minus . And when I run electrons in part , and suck them out of the other part , the total amount of plusiness and minusiness of the whole block changes . So I can take that diode and add a _ third _ block of stuff that \'s even _ more _ plussy or minusy than the first two . As long as I put it on the far side of the "" same kind of stuff "" . By that I mean I can do "" Positive - negative - positive "" or "" Negative - positive - negative "" . It \'s got to be three layers and one has to be "" stronger "" than the other two , hence the capital letter . So after I make this three layer sandwich , when I suck electrons out of the center ( in the Npn case ) or add electrons to the center ( in the Pnp ) case , there \'s that diode between the capital letter and the center doing the normal diode thing . But now the second magic bit . As the center gets more electrons added / removed the two ends with the same doping become able to "" see each other "" . Understand that a "" Pp "" or an "" Nn "" block of silicon will just pass the electrons on after wasting some of the energy as heat . So as you feed the interruption in the middle the electrons start to be able to go all the way through . The more you stimulate the middle , the more electricity can get from end - to - end . If you stimulate the middle "" enough "" it \'s like the middle piece was just removed . So what does that practically mean ? At low currents a transistor is an amplifier . Put a little power on the center and a _ proportionally _ larger power can flow from end - to - end . At higher currents , known as the "" saturation current "" , the transistor becomes an on - off switch . So the transistors in your radio amplify the tiny signals received over the air into the big signals necessary to move your speakers and make sound . And the transistors in your computer , being operated at saturation , can do "" logic "" because by using switches in groups you do that AND / OR / NOT stuff . Finally , the smaller a transistor is , they less energy needs to be put on that center part , and the less heat is generated as the electricity flows from N - to - n or P - to - p. So big honking transistors can operate real - world things ( your stereo ) and lots of tiny transistors can become a phone or a computer .']",0

How does a Turing machine work and what does it do All I know is it 's in a CPU and it manipulates binary data Explain like I'm five.,"['A Turing machine is * not * in a CPU and it does * not * manipulate binary data . It is important to not start with false assumptions , I think . :-) A Turing machine is more like a rule - based game than a physical toy . Think of it like the game Solitaire . You start with a deck of shuffled cards and lay them out according to the rules of the game . This is one part of the Turing machine , which we call the input . The next part of the Turing machine is the end state --- this describes the conditions when the game has ended . In Solitaire you win by getting all your cards into numerical ordered columns ; and you lose by getting through all your cards without managing to do this , so you have no further options . The third important part of the Turing machine is the rules of the game : at each stage it tells you which moves you can make . In some types of game there are several moves you can make at each step , and it \'s a matter of the player to choose . Others there is no choice and the fun of the game comes from having it unfold in front of you even though you ca n\'t affect the outcome . The Turing machine was invented to make formal the notion of rules and processes . The question that Alan Turing wanted to answer was about the "" end game "" . Is it possible to know whether you will win a game of Solitaire without playing the game of Solitaire ? Could you be stuck in an endless loop if there was no way to lose , only to win ? In the process of answering this question he realised that he could write down each of his Turing machines as a grouping of symbols , like { input , rules , end conditions } and that would be a complete definition of that Turing machine . This would be the ultimate formal definition of Solitaire , or whatever . But once you \'ve got a definition of a Turing machine as a series of symbols , you can feed that to a Turing machines whose rules tell it how to recognise symbols . So let \'s say I have a Turing machine called SolTM = { input deck , Solitaire rules , end conditions } . And I have a new one called UTM = { input TM , rules , end conditions } . If I manipulate SolTM using the rules defined in UTM then I am making the UTM _ act like SolTM _ . This is the essence of Alan Turing \'s _ Universal Turing Machine _ , a device that can pretend to be other devices if given a description of how they work . I appreciate this may be some pretty hairy stuff , and over the heads of most 25 year - olds :-) but it \'s also the foundations of our understanding of computation , ie the question of "" mechanically "" producing an output from input+rules .', ""Wikipedia does a decent job , so I 'll try to simplify that a bit more ( at the expense of exactness ) . A turing machine is * not * a physical machine ( though people have made them ) . It is a theoretical object which is used to model , in a sense , the simplest possible computer . It is fed an input , and can return ' yes ' or ' no ' ( or continue forever ) . An example ( and a good exercise ) is to ' build ' a machine to test if an integer is divisible by 9 . The input would then be the integer , and the machine would return ' yes ' or ' no ' at the end . Say you have an infinite tape of symbols , and a ' head ' , which the tape is fed to , and which can be in different ' states ' or ' modes ' . At each symbol , the head takes some action . An action could be ' if the head is in state 1 and if the symbol is an A , erase the A and write B , change to state 2 , and move three spaces to the right ' , or ' if the head is in state 2 and the symbol is a C , return yes and quit ' . To test for divisibility by nine , the machine might be as follows : the input tape contains the number written in decimal notation , with one digit per space . We would have ten states , 0 , 1 , 2 , ... 9 . The rules would be : ' start in state 0 and move to the first symbol ' , and ' at each symbol , add the symbol to the current state and add the digits until we have a number less than 10 , then move right one space ' , and ' if we hit a blank space and we are in state 9 or 0 , return yes . otherwise return no ' . This uses the idea that if the sum of digits is divisible by 9 , then the number is divisible by 9 . Try this out with , say , 574281 as an input to see how the machine works . A turing machine is not a model of a real computer . It is , however , theoretically capable of doing anything a real computer can do . The simplicity of turing machines compared to real computers makes them very useful for proving things , because if something can not be done with a turing machine , it can not be done with any equivalent computing machine . They are also used extensively for algorithm analysis . The number of ' actions ' taken by the machine is a useful measurement of how fast an algorithm is ."", 'The general idea is that you have a machine that reads an infinite tape and keeps track of what state it \'s in . The tape tells you what to do next ( read the next instruction , read the last one , etc ) . A Turing machine is totally abstract so the tape can be infinite in length , but you can only have a finite number of states . The important thing to keep in mind here is that there \'s no difference between data and instructions . CPUs work in more or less the same fashion , except that the "" tape "" ( memory ) is finite , thus a language is said to be "" Turing complete "" if it supports all the possible operations that a Turing machine can process . Another important point : Turing machines are where theory hits the pavement -- you can prove things about Turing machines based only on math , but the same can not be said about real world computers . This is one of the main reasons why people study them . Edit : many typos fixed !']",0

How does a Value Added Tax (VAT) differ from a Sales Tax?,"['A value-added tax (VAT) is a tax on the consumption of goods and services that is levied at each stage of production and distribution. It is based on the value added to a product or service at each stage of production, and it is typically imposed on the sale of goods and services.A sales tax, on the other hand, is a tax on the sale of goods and services that is levied at the point of sale. It is based on the price of the product or service being sold, and it is typically imposed on the purchaser.One key difference between a VAT and a sales tax is that a VAT is a multi-stage tax, while a sales tax is a single-stage tax. In a VAT system, the tax is collected at each stage of production and distribution, and the tax paid at each stage is credited against the tax due on the final sale of the product or service. This means that only the value added at each stage is subject to the tax.In a sales tax system, the tax is collected only at the point of sale, and the entire sale price is subject to the tax. This means that the tax is paid on the entire value of the product or service, not just the value added at each stage of production.Another difference is that a VAT is typically imposed on a broader range of goods and services than a sales tax. In many countries, certain essential goods and services, such as food and healthcare, are taxed at a lower rate or are exempt from VAT. Sales taxes, on the other hand, are typically applied to a broader range of goods and services, and there are generally fewer exemptions.Both VAT and sales tax are indirect taxes, which means that they are not levied directly on individuals, but rather on the sale of goods and services. They are typically collected by businesses and remitted to the government, and the cost of the tax is ultimately passed on to the consumer in the form of higher prices.']",1
How does a Value Added Tax (VAT) differ from a Sales Tax?,"[""Sales taxes are charged at the point of purchase, while a VAT is assessed during the production process of the item. In the end, the amount paid by the consumer is the same, but with the VAT, the tax was collected from the manufacturer, instead of the consumer. One of the big arguments for VAT is that it prevents lost revenue due to things like smuggling (if sales tax increases past 10% smuggling spikes, so the VAT is a good mechanism if you're looking to implement large taxes on goods). It also keeps the tax burden away from shippers and other tiers of the production process that don't change the intrinsic value of the item.""]",0
How does a bank make money ? How does a bank make the money to pay employees and provide interest ? Please explain like I'm five.,"[""There 's a concept in economics called the money multiplier . Basically , a bank is only required to keep 10 % of the value of its deposits on hand , and loans out the other 90 % .

How does a bank make money ? How does a bank make the money to pay employees and provide interest ? Please explain like I'm five.,"['Sure! A bank makes money by lending out money to people and businesses and charging them interest on the loans. For example, if someone takes out a mortgage to buy a house, the bank will lend them the money to buy the house and charge them interest on the loan. The bank will also charge people and businesses fees for other services, such as cashing checks or setting up a new bank account. \nThe bank uses the money it makes from loans and fees to pay its employees and provide interest to people who have deposited money in the bank. When people deposit money in the bank, the bank is allowed to use that money to make loans to other people. In return, the bank pays the depositors a small amount of interest on their money. This is how a bank is able to make money and provide interest at the same time.']",1
How does a bank make money on an interest free secured loan?,"[""Very good answers as to how 0% loans are typically done.  In addition, many are either tied to a specific large item purchase, or credit cards with a no interest period.  On credit card transactions the bank is getting a fee from the retailer, who in turn is giving you a hidden charge to cover that fee.  In the case of a large purchase item like a car, the retailer is again quite likely paying a fee to cover what would be that interest, something they are willing to do to make the sale.  They will typically be less prone to deal as low a price in negotiation if you were not making that deal, or at times they may offer either a rebate or special low to zero finance rates, but you don't get both.""]",0
How does a bank make money on an interest free secured loan?,"[""Banks typically make money on loans by charging interest on the amount borrowed. An interest-free loan would not generate any income for the bank from the interest payments. However, there are other ways that banks can make money on an interest-free secured loan.One way is by requiring the borrower to pay fees for the loan, such as origination fees or closing costs. These fees can help offset the cost of providing the loan and can contribute to the bank's profitability.Another way is by using the loan as a way to attract deposits or other business from the borrower. For example, the bank may offer an interest-free loan as a way to encourage the borrower to open a checking or savings account with the bank, or to use other financial products or services offered by the bank. The bank can then make money from these other sources of business.Finally, the bank may make money on the loan by earning a profit on the sale of the assets that were used as collateral for the loan. For example, if the borrower used a piece of property as collateral for the loan and defaulted on the loan, the bank could sell the property and use the proceeds to pay off the loan and potentially earn a profit.""]",1

Acetate is then used by your body for energy instead of the calories from food that you eat. This means that the calories from the alcohol are not being used by your body, and they can be stored as fat.\n\nOver time, if you drink a lot of alcohol and do not burn off the extra calories through exercise or other physical activity, the fat can build up and cause a bulge in your stomach. This bulge is sometimes referred to as a ""beer gut.""\n\nIt\'s important to note that it\'s not just beer that can cause a beer gut. Any type of alcohol can contribute to excess fat in the stomach area if it is consumed in large amounts over a long period of time.

The speedometer is typically located on the dashboard of the car and shows the driver how fast the car is going.\r\n\r\nTo measure the speed of the car, the speedometer uses a small device called a speedometer cable. The speedometer cable is connected to the car's transmission, which is the part of the car that sends power from the engine to the wheels. As the car moves, the transmission turns a small gear called a drive gear, which is connected to the speedometer cable.\r\n\r\nThe speedometer cable sends the rotational speed of the drive gear to the speedometer, which then converts that information into a speed reading that is displayed on the dashboard.\r\n\r\nIf you replace the wheels on a car with wheels of different diameters, it can affect the accuracy of the speedometer. This is because the speedometer is calibrated based on the diameter of the original wheels. If you put on wheels with a larger diameter, the speedometer may show that the car is going slower than it actually is. Similarly, if you put on wheels with a smaller diameter, the speedometer may show that the car is going faster than it actually is.\r\n\r\nIn general, it's important to make sure that your car's wheels are the correct size and that the speedometer is calibrated correctly, so you can accurately gauge how fast you are driving and ensure that you are following the speed limits.""]",1
How does a car measure it 's speed to show up in the speedometer ? What happens if the car is replaced with wheels of different diameters ? Does it matter ? Title . Explain like I'm five.,"[""It measures its speed by sensing each time a wheel makes a full rotation . So yes changing to a wheel with a different diameter then stock will throw the measurement off . This can usually be fixed by a reprogramming tool ( for newer vehicles ) Some vehicles use GPS based speedometers . But I do n't believe this is a very common thing . In this case wheel size has no effect ."", ""There are three possible methods a car could use . I 've heard of GPS speedometers which constantly determine your position on the Earth then divide the distance between two coordinates found by the time between when each coordinate was found . I 've never seen one of these , only heard rumors they exist in vehicles . The main problems with this method are remaining connected to the GPS satellites and getting precise data . Many GPSs have a poor spatial resolution , meaning they will know your location to within a fairly large distance of possibly thirty feet or more . In addition , because the signals used for communication are so weak when they arrive , ( satellites are really far away ) , if you are in a tunnel , under a bridge , in a city with a lot of tall towers , or experiencing bad weather , you could lose the signal . These problems make me doubt these systems are actually used in vehicles . This method does not rely on the wheels ' radius . Another method is to have one or more magnets attached to a shaft somewhere in the powertrain . When these magnets rotate , they induce electric currents in a coil of wire as they pass by it . Each time a magnet passes by this coil , a pulse of electricity is generated . The frequency of these pulses can be measured , and if the gear ratio between the shaft and the wheels is known , and if the radius of the wheels is known , the rotational speed of the wheels can be determined mathematically . The third method involves more magnets and a larger coil of wire . When the magnets on a shaft are rotating , they induce an electric current in a coil of wire , ( this time , the current is continuous , not pulsed . ) This electric current is amplified and used to heat a strip of metal . This metal strip actually consists of two different types of metal sandwiched together . When the strip heats up , the metals expand , but each of the two metals expands by a different amount causing the strip to bend . The strip is connected mechanically to the speedometer , so when the strip bends , the indicator moves . The amount it moves is ultimately dependent on the speed of the shaft containing the magnets , as is the speed of the vehicle . This method also relies on having a known wheel radius . EDIT : If the wheel diameter is changed , the vehicle 's firmware can be modified to accommodate for this ."", 'It is tuned with a factor of the output RPM from the transmission . If you use larger tires , the speed displayed is less than your actual speed . Source : I used to own a car with 70R14 tires whereas it came from the factory with 65R14 tires .']",0

How does a change in market cap affect a company's operational decisions?,"[""In practical terms, it shouldn't.  Market cap changes every day (assuming public trading, of course) or even second-by-second, and focusing on investor sentiment toward your company's stock is not the wisest way to make strategic decisions. That being said, company execs do need to be mindful of unusual swings in their company's share prices because it can sometimes be an indicator of news/information of which they're unaware.  At the same time, you can't just disregard your shareholders, especially the big institutional players who may have large voting blocks with which to replace you if they feel you're not responsive to events.  They are the ones who make strategic decisions based on your company's share price, right? (grin) The issue around swings in market cap is more about public perception than reality, so it is important for companies to have a good public relations strategy ready to go that can address questions/concerns in case of some market event.  After all, consumers who hear that a company's share price has suddenly fallen by, say, 30% might be more hesitant to do business with that company because there's a (perhaps irrational) fear the company's not doing well and may not be around much longer. Investors are, by their very nature, emotional rather than rational.  Any kind of news can cause a stampede toward or away from a stock for no reason that an investment professional could ever explain.  That's why it's impossible to spend any real time focusing on market cap (leave that to your P.R. department to worry about). IF, as a company executive, you focus on doing the right things to make your company successful then any questions/concerns about market cap will resolve themselves. Good luck!""]",0
How does a change in market cap affect a company's operational decisions?,"[""Market capitalization, or market cap, is a measure of the value of a company's outstanding shares of stock. It is calculated by multiplying the company's stock price by the number of shares outstanding. A company's market cap can be affected by a variety of factors, including changes in the company's financial performance, changes in industry conditions, and changes in investor sentiment.A change in a company's market cap can have some impact on its operational decisions, but it is just one factor among many that the company may consider when making business decisions. For example, if a company's market cap increases significantly, it may have more resources available to invest in new projects or expand its operations. On the other hand, if a company's market cap decreases, it may need to be more cautious about spending and may need to focus on cost-cutting measures.However, it's important to note that market cap is just one measure of a company's value, and it does not necessarily reflect the company's underlying financial performance or its ability to generate profits. As such, it is just one factor that a company may consider when making operational decisions, and it is not the only factor.""]",1

How does a city / town actually get started ? Are new cities still being created in the US ? What is the process to create my own city ? Please explain like I'm five.,"['The town of Clark , Texas , agreed to change its name to "" DISH "" in 2005 , after the town council worked out a corporate deal that would give every resident free satellite TV . The founder of the town , L.E. Clark , was disappointed by the change . "" I worked my butt off a little over a year getting it incorporated , "" he told the Associated Press . How do you found a town ? Get to know the neighbors . Though each state has its own rules on "" municipal incorporation , "" in general you \'ll need to get 51 percent of the eligible voters in the area to go along with you . ( It \'s easiest to start a town from scratch , as opposed to by secession ; most upstarts begin as "" unincorporated communities "" within a larger county . ) In 2000 , Clark hired a surveyor to draw up boundaries for a town that would be a little bigger than a square mile and would include 254 people — of whom only 65 were registered to vote . To found Clark , Texas , he had to convince only a few dozen neighbors it was a good idea . To incorporate a town , you \'ll need a lawyer who can handle the paperwork . Once you \'ve decided on where to put your town , the first step toward You - ville is to get a petition signed by some of the people who live there . In Texas , you \'ll need 10 percent of the voters . In Arkansas , you need to get 75 signatures , no matter how big your town is going to be . An application for forming a town includes the signed petition , a proposed name , and — in some cases — a proposed form of government . There are four basic town governments to choose from — mayor - council , council - manager , commission , or representative town meeting — but some states \' laws limit your options depending on the size of your community . Once you complete your application , all you typically need is a "" yes "" vote from your neighbors and the approval of a county judge or state official . In some places , though , a town charter must be granted by vote of the state legislature . Depending on where you live , you may face certain restrictions on your right to incorporate . Your proposed town may need to have a minimum number of people , for example , or it may need to be a minimum distance from other towns and cities . The description of where it is should be very specific — for an example , take a look at the charter - specified boundaries of Danbury , Conn. And some states will expect your town to have a unique name , so think again if you wanted to use "" Fairview "" or "" Midway . "" An unincorporated community gets its services from the county without paying municipal taxes , so frivolous town - founding can be a bad idea . Why might you want to incorporate ? First , you could be heading off annexation by a nearby city . The residents of what is now DISH , Texas were afraid of being annexed by Fort Worth . If their land had become part of the city , they \'d have faced the high property taxes used to cover social services in less affluent areas . Second , unincorporated communities have very little control over what gets built in the area . But towns can control their own zoning — and thereby protect their property values . [ s ] ( URL_0 )', ""I can answer the question of new cities being created . I moved to unincorporated Arapahoe County , CO in the mid 1990 's . In 2001 it became the [ City of Centennial , CO ] ( URL_0 ) . It 's a suburban area of Denver that grew outside the bounds of nearby incorporated cities . The drive to incorporate , and the motivation for many people in the community , was the encroachment of nearby Greenwood Village , CO . Greenwood Village was annexing nearby commercial property for the sales tax revenue , but excluding the nearby residential property . The people in the community did not like spending money at a business next door , but the taxes went to someone else . The vote for incorporation was approved by an astonishing 77 % and was the largest new incorporation in US history ."", 'Oh boy . This is a very difficult question to answer correctly . There is an entire subdiscipline in history solely devoted to this . I \'ve followed many courses and been to more than a few conferences on the history of cities and it \'s still a very complex and difficult process to grasp . Nontheless , I \'ll try to type out some of the more basic elements and processes involved . I \'ll be brief and I wo n\'t go into much detail , so if you still have more in depth questions ; you \'ll have to ask me specifically . As you might know , mankind started out as hunter - gatherers . Most humans were nomadic tribes who would follow the seasons and the land . At some point in history , remarkably simultaneous on different continents , some people started to settle down . The reasons why this happened are still heavily debated . At the very start it was n\'t at all beneficial . The life expectancy and overall health of the people in most early settlements was actually lower than those of the hunter - gatherers . Sedentary families or tribes were much more vulnerable to violence and foreign attacks . It \'s self - explanatory that it \'s easier to harass or rob someone whose possessions are in one place than someone who can just pack up and run away . So in order to defend themselves , bigger groups went to live together and most of these groups even built defenses . This was n\'t the only reason to work together though , at this point in time even hunter - gatherer tribes had realized that working together was a great way to combat unforseen circumstances like hunger or disease . Living together in big groups required some organization though . That \'s when things like "" government "" or "" social order "" started to really flourish . Clear rules , distinctions and a social hierarchy were needed in order for that many people to co - habit on peace . A big part of history is just the painful process of mankind learning to live together . This is only how the first towns came into existence , but it \'s important to know because many modern cities are based on the ruins or remains of older settlements or through the adaptation to new circumstances . Throughout history there are diverse reasons as to why certain towns got started . Mostly these are ecomical circumstances like the presence of arable land , good accessibility via land or water , a harbor , a certain type of industry or any combination of these factors . It \'s much more complex than this , but at it \'s core there are mostly two type of cities : those that came into existence thanks to their ability to serve as a gateway for trade and those who came into existence thanks to a certain type of industry . So why are certain regions are more heavily inhabited than others ? Mostly the reasons for this are called "" push "" and "" pull "" factors . The "" pull "" factors are those that pull people closer to a certain center . These include things like commodities , space , social fabric and economic opportunities . At the same time "" push "" factors are those things that push people away from crowded places . Things like crime , the lack of economic opportunities , the appeal of nature , etc . Let \'s say for example that you came to a freshly colonized America and you had to decide where to settle . Would you settle on the edge of a town , within range of a doctor and a good grocery shop ( pull factors ) or would you rather settle somewhere close to a friend ( pull factor ) who you know you can trust ( push / pull factor ) ? Understanding this principle can explain many settlements in the USA that are not based on ancient settlements like the ones in Europe or Asia . In the USA there are more than a few cities / towns that started as basic settlements who existed solely thanks to the promise of land and easy gold but gradually adapted to changing economic circumstances . So yes , new cities are still being created if the preconditions are met . In contemporary countries like the USA a new city usually arises or grows when a big company offers work and amenities closeby . So I guess the best way to start a new city in modern times is to build your own company , pick a suitable plot of land and build a huge office or factory there . Preferably you would also need good roads and/or public transport . This might encourage people to commute however , so if you do n\'t want that to happen , you could provide them with leisure , shops , housing and healthcare closeby . Over time , a city might just arise . It \'s actually not that different from Sim City I guess . Good luck ?']",0

"How does a clutch work ? When it comes to cars , I am 5 . Explain like I'm five.","['Sure! A clutch is a part of a car\'s engine that helps the car switch between gears while driving. It\'s kind of like a switch that can turn off and on the power between the engine and the wheels. Imagine you are riding your bike and you want to go faster.

Whenever the engine spins the flywheel does too . The pressure plate is then bolted directly onto the flywheel . Trapped inbetween them , but not bolted to either , is the clutch disc . Inside the pressure plate there \'s a "" pressure disc "" and some form of spring . Normally , the spring presses the pressure disc against the clutch disc . Which in turn presses the clutch disc against the flywheel . The clutch disc has brakepad - like stuff riveted to it , so when it presses against the spinning flywheel , friction causes it to spin too .

How does a clutch work I 've been trying to understand the concept for a long time Explain like I'm five.,"[""A clutch is a mechanical device that allows a car to connect and disconnect the power from the engine to the transmission. The clutch is located between the engine and the transmission and is operated by a pedal. When the pedal is pressed down, it disengages the clutch and disconnects the engine from the transmission. When the pedal is released, it engages the clutch and connects the engine to the transmission. Here's how it works: When you press down on the clutch pedal, it pushes a rod (called a throw-out bearing) that presses against a pressure plate. The pressure plate is a flat metal disk with a spring behind it. The spring is attached to the flywheel, which is a heavy metal disk that's attached to the back of the engine. When the pressure plate is pressed against the flywheel, it creates a gap between the two disks. This gap separates the engine from the transmission, which means the car can't move. When you release the clutch pedal, the spring behind the pressure plate pushes it back against the flywheel. This closes the gap between the two disks and allows the engine and the transmission to be connected again. The car can now move because power from the engine is being transferred to the transmission, which sends it to the wheels. The clutch is used when you want to shift gears or stop the car. When you shift gears, you have to press the clutch pedal down to disengage the engine from the transmission. This allows you to move the gearshift lever to the next gear. Then, you have to release the clutch pedal to engage the engine and the transmission again. I hope that helps to clarify how a clutch works! Let me know if you have any questions.""]",1

A clutch is designed to * slip * , and if you can imagine it , works similar to how a disc brake system works but in reverse . In a vehicle , a clutch is used to separate the engine from the transmission for a few purposes like gear changes and starting the damned thing . Why do we even * need * a clutch ?

Metal content: Different coins are made of different metals, so the coin slot can use sensors to measure the metal content of the coin and determine which one it is. Appearance: The coin slot can use a camera to take a picture of the coin and compare it to a database of images to determine which coin it is. Overall, the coin slot uses a combination of these methods to determine which coin has been inserted, and it then sends this information to the machine's processor, which decides whether to accept the coin and allow the user to make a purchase or play a game.""]",1
How does a coin slot determine which coin is inserted ? I 've always wondered this . This is for coin slots that accept more than one kind of coin . Is it a weight thing ? Size ? Appearance of the coin ? Explain like I'm five.,"[""It depends on the type of coin slot . In a vending machine such as those which have a [ ball on top and dispense gumballs or bouncing balls ] ( URL_2 ) , the mechanism is usually based on size . There are some [ washers ] ( URL_0 ) produced that have a similar size to a specific coin ( you just got ta look for the ones you want , somebody somewhere makes 'em ) . These are usually called _ _ _ slugs _ _ _ and often you can find them as the knockouts from [ electrical panel boxes as well ] ( URL_1 ) . When we get into the range of much larger machines , such as soda or snack machines , the mechanisms inside have a lot more room for more sensitive measuring equipment . Those often detect based on magnetic signature as well as size and weight . What I wanted to find and do n't see anywhere is a closeup of the top slot , to the right ( since most turn clockwise ) of the slot , showing the lever that measures size on the gumball size machines . If you look at those you can usually see where to insert a really thin pin to get the wheel to turn for free on older machines ."", 'The machines I owned dispensed beverages and snacks . They had magnetic sensors in them arranged to measure the size of the coins . The coins did not freefall , but rather rolled down an incline , such that different diameter coins rolled at different rates . The machine was able to measure that rate , as well as the size and magnetic properties of a coin . After that , they sorted according to size , first refilling the coin return storage , and if that was full(it had sensors too ) , into an unsorted box . The machine could actually make change based on what it had in reserve . For example , if it owed you 30 cents , but had no quarters , it would spit out 3 dimes . The mechanism was quite ingenuous , relatively small and easily swapped out . The selection pad was another discrete component , which also stored prices , so if a coin acceptor failed , it was 30 seconds or less to swap out .', ""While we 're on the topic of how machines recognize inserted coins : * Is it just a myth that one could tie a string around a coin and use it multiple times to get an item from a vending machine ? * If so , why do n't machines have mechanisms for counteracting against such fraud ?""]",0

But wait , is n\'t that the symbol for one and zero ? Right , so in our numbering system , when we get to the number ten , we write the symbol for one and zero . There is no symbol for ten , we simply recycle the ones we already have . Because of this , we call our numbering system "" base - ten "" , or "" decimal "" . "" Ones and zeros"",""true and false "" , and "" on or off "" are all terms you have probably heard before . What these all are referring to is a * different * kind of numbering system . For our decimal system , we write a \' 10 \' when we get to ten , but for binary , we write a \' 10 \' when we get to two . There is no symbol for two in binary , exactly how there is no symbol for ten in decimal . "" On "" or "" off "" simply refers to \' 1 \' or \' 0 \' in binary . Just to make sure that makes sense ( as its super important ): 01 = one ; 10 = two ; 11 = three ; Make sense ? Cool ( if not google "" binary "" ) . Ok , now for something completely different , but related . There s something in computer theory called a "" logic gate "" . It \'s a device . It has two inputs , and one output . The only input it accepts is "" on "" or "" off "" , and the output is the same , "" on "" or "" off "" . You might see the relation to binary . A logic gates output is based on its input . An example of a logic gate is a "" AND "" gate . When both of the inputs are on , the output is on . Otherwise , the output is off . You still with me ? Do n\'t worry , the cool stuff is coming soon . Another logic gate is the "" NOT "" gate . The NOT gate has one input . If the input is off , the output is on , and vice versa . The output is * not * the input . Get it ? Now , if we put the input of a NOT gate on the output of an AND gate , we get a NAND gate . Creative , I know . We nerds do n\'t get out much . Anyways , try to figure out what the output would be for all the four different possible combinations of the two inputs for the NAND gate . [ Anyways , heres what a NAND gate looks like drawn . ] ( URL_1 ) Now , you have probably heard of computer memory right ? [ * * ta da ! * * ] ( URL_2 ) It \'s not going to make total sense at first , but that diagram shows a memory - holder - thingamajig . Look at it for a while and try to figure out what it does . Basically it holds a "" bit "" of memory . You could say that a bit is like one digit of a binary number . You line a bunch of these in a row , and you can start holding numbers . But what do you * do * with those numbers ? This is where it gets cool . You do math with those numbers . This next device is called an "" [ * adder * ] ( URL_3 ) "" . The gate on top is called an XOR gate , its output is on if only one of its inputs is on . If there both on or off , then the output is off . Now , make it a [ little more complex ] ( URL_0 ) and you can add multiple bits at the same time , by linking the last ones "" Cout "" to the next ones "" Cin "" . Cool , now we have a basic calculator . How can we turn this up to 11 and make a computer ? Code . Now , you know what data is , and so code is easy to explain . Its just data . That s all it is . Really . The reason why its different then other data though , is because the CPU interprets it as * instructions . * If we wanted to do math for example , and we got to decide the instruction definitions we could use a system like ; 00000001 = * add * a number to another number ; 00000010 = * subtract * a number from another number ; With this , we can set what logic gates are being used based on data . Now , real quick , memory is organized on a computer by something called memory addresses , basically they just allow the CPU to ask for memory at a specific location . Generally speaking the addresses are sized by "" bytes "" which is just another word for "" eight bits "" . So if we wanted to access memory location five or whatever we could store that as \' 00000101 \' . Lets go back and add some more to our table ; 00000011 = move this data into some location ; Cool , now we can say something like : "" add the number at location # 5 in memory to the other number at location # 7 in memory . "" By breaking it down into : ( add ) ( memory address # 5 ) ( memory address # 7 ) Which is really just 00000001 00000101 00000111 Pretty sweet right ? But hold on , how does the CPU know where to get its instructions ? On the cpu , There s a tiny amount of memory , it does various things , such as hold something called the "" instruction pointer "" . The instruction pointer holds the address of the next instruction , and increments itself after every instruction . So basically , the cpu reads the instruction pointer , fetches the next instruction , does it , adds one to the instruction pointer , and then goes back to step one . But what happens when it runs out of instructions ? Lets go back to our table . Last time , I promise : 00000100 = set instruction pointer to address Basically , all this instruction does is set the instruction pointer to a number . You ever wonder what an infinite loop is on a computer ? That s what happens when an instruction pointer is set to instructions that keep telling the instruction pointer to set itself to that same set of instructions .

A computer is a machine that can perform tasks, like storing and retrieving information, doing calculations, and communicating with other devices. At the heart of a computer is the central processing unit (CPU), which is the ""brain"" of the computer. It reads and executes instructions that tell the computer what to do. The instructions that the CPU follows are called programs. Programs are written in a special language called code, which is a set of instructions that the computer can understand and follow. The CPU reads the instructions in a program and carries them out by manipulating data. Data is information that a computer can use, like numbers, text, or pictures. The CPU can read data from storage devices, like a hard drive or a USB flash drive, and it can also receive data from other devices, like a keyboard or a mouse. The CPU stores data in its own memory, called RAM (random access memory). RAM is like a workspace where the CPU can access and manipulate data quickly. When the computer is turned off, the data in RAM is lost. The CPU also sends and receives data to and from other parts of the computer, like the display, which is the screen you see, and the speakers, which produce sound. The CPU sends the data to these devices through wires called cables, which are connected to the motherboard (the main circuit board inside the computer). So to summarize, a computer works by reading and executing instructions from programs, manipulating data, and sending and receiving data to and from other parts of the computer and devices. I hope that helps! Is there anything else you\'d like to know about how a computer works?']",1
How does a computer boot ? What is that which brings the hardware to life ? How does the code communicate with hardware to do things ? Please explain like I'm five.,"['Sure! When a computer is turned on, it goes through a process called ""booting"" to get itself ready to be used. This process is like a person waking up and getting dressed in the morning.The first thing that happens when the computer is turned on is that the hardware checks itself to make sure everything is working properly. This is called a ""power-on self-test,"" or POST.Next, the computer looks for a special program called the ""bootloader."" The bootloader is a small piece of software that is stored on a chip on the computer\'s motherboard. It\'s kind of like a map that tells the computer where to find the rest of the operating system, which is the main program that runs on the computer and lets you do things like open and close programs, save and open files, and connect to the internet.Once the bootloader has been found, it loads the operating system into the computer\'s memory and then starts it. The operating system then takes control of the computer and starts running.To communicate with the hardware and do things, the computer uses something called ""instructions."" Instructions are like a set of step-by-step instructions that tell the computer what to do. The instructions are written in a special language called ""code,"" which the computer can understand and follow.So, to sum it up: when you turn on a computer, the hardware checks itself, the bootloader loads the operating system, and the operating system uses instructions to communicate with the hardware and do things.']",1
How does a computer boot ? What is that which brings the hardware to life ? How does the code communicate with hardware to do things ? Please explain like I'm five.,"['On a very basic level , the hardware is designed in such a way that it recognizes electric pulses as either ones or zeroes . Once you grapple with that , it all goes from there . And I \'ve definitely been in your place , trust me . Going through CompTIA courses and like "" Okay but * * * how * * * ? "" Seriously the main and underlying thing is that : every piece of a computer ( and I \'m talking really about the motherboard , I guess ) is designed to read those electrical signals as something . Once you have something plugged into the wall , it \'s easy to "" make "" electrical pulses , and that \'s exactly what a computer does . Each layer gets more technical . Until you have this webpage ( simple ) or Overwatch ( hard ) .', 'Inside the computer \'s CPU is something called the "" program counter "" , which keeps track of what the computer is doing . It points to the bit of memory that contains the next instruction the computer needs to execute . When the computer is first turned on , the program counter points to a bit of memory in a special chip called "" BIOS "" . BIOS contains instructions to do a number of different things , such as let the operating system talk to the hardware , and let the user configure some of the hardware ... but the main thing we \'re interested in if we \'re talking about booting , is that the BIOS contains a user - configurable list of where to look for the boot device . You might set this to check the CD drive first of all , for example . And if the CD drive does n\'t contain a bootable CD ( which it usually wo n\'t ) , then it might check the hard disk next . The hard disk will normally have a bootable operating system on it , such as Windows . So now , the BIOS loads the first part of Windows from the hard disk and runs it . And that is responsible for loading everything else that needs to be loaded .', 'A computer consists of CPU and memory . Memory is the simpler chip to understand -- memory consists of a large array of * memory cells * , each of which can contain a 0 or a 1 ( a single bit ) . The cells are divided into groups of 8 , each group can contain 8 bits ( one byte ) . Each 8 - bit group is numbered with an * address * which is simply a number ( coded in binary ) that identifies the cell . So for example , the CPU can tell memory "" write 00101101 into cell number 1493 "" . Then at a later point in time , the computer can tell memory "" read the contents of cell number 1493 "" and memory will respond with "" 00101101 "" . The address 1493 is itself coded as a sequence of bits , so the CPU would actually say "" read / write the contents of cell number 0000010111010101 "" . A typical CPU / memory interface consists of a number of * lines * which are several copper wires that physically connect the CPU to the memory : - Address lines . The CPU puts the coded address of the cell it wants to work with ( such as 0000010111010101 ) on these 16 lines . - Data lines . The data ( 00101101 ) goes on these 8 lines . In the case of writing data into memory , the CPU sets the data lines . In the case of reading data from memory , the memory sets the data lines . - R / W bit . A single line which the CPU sets to 0 when it wants to read from memory , 1 when it wants to write to memory . - Clock . Pulses on this line dictate the timing of exactly when the memory / CPU should read / write the address / data lines . How quickly the clock pulses occur determines how quickly memory can be read / written . Making it faster increases system performance , but also increases the physical speed requirements of the CPU / memory chips . The CPU works by reading memory at the program counter , executing the instruction based on what it does , and incrementing the program counter to get it to the next instruction . For example , 37 might be the code for "" load the number 0 into register A "" , the 3 - byte sequence 87 21 63 might be the code for "" load the number 6321 into register B "" , 88 34 14 might be the code for "" load the number 3414 into register C "" and 22 might be the code for "" add register A to register C , then store the result in register A. "" ( A * register * is a small number of memory cell circuits inside the CPU which serve as a "" scratch pad "" or "" short term memory "" for the CPU to store values internally . ) If we wanted to do these things in a program , it would be 37 87 21 63 88 34 14 22 which would go into consecutive memory cells . Let \'s put 37 87 21 63 88 34 14 22 into memory cells at addresses 2100 , 2101 , 2102 , 2103 , etc . then set the PC to 2100 , and let the CPU run . The CPU reads a 37 from address 2100 , increments PC to 2101 and executes the instruction to set register A to 0 . PC is now 2101 , so the CPU reads an 87 from address 2101 , increments PC to 2102 , sees that 87 is code for a three - byte instruction , fetches the first additional byte 21 from PC ( which is 2102 ) , increments PC to 2103 , fetches a second additional byte 63 from PC , increments PC to 2104 . The CPU now has the three bytes needed for the second instruction and loads 6321 into register B. The CPU keeps on doing this fetch - decode - execute loop forever ( or until powered down ) . Now that you know how CPU and memory work , the boot process is simple : Physically hard wired in the CPU is a number called a * reset vector * ( like all numbers in a computer , it \'s coded in binary ) . Upon system power - up or reset , the CPU copies the reset vector into the program counter . It \'s up to the system designer to include a memory chip which will respond to the reset vector address and contain a useful program . On the PC , this memory chip is called * BIOS * . The initial chip is referred to as a ROM ( read only memory ) , because in the early days it was literally hard wired with the program . In modern times ROM \'s are flash chips ( the technology in USB disks , smart phones and modern SSD hard drives ) , so the ROM is n\'t truly "" read only "" ( it can be written to ) , but it \'s still called ROM to distinguish it from "" ordinary "" memory or RAM ( which is much faster , but loses data when powered down ) . Now your second question : How code communicates with hardware . As well as being connected to memory , the CPU has extra pins which can be connected to other devices . There are CPU instructions to read and write the electrical state of these pins . There are a number of standardized communication methods for sending data over these extra pins ( serial , SPI , I2C , ISA , PCI ) . Also you can have devices which are n\'t memory cells connected to the memory bus and respond to memory addresses ( "" memory - mapped I / O "" ) . So really the heart of the computer is the CPU + memory which makes it possible to execute a program consisting of stored instructions . For everything else you just need a physical connection to the CPU and a way to access that connection from the software level of stored instructions . The vast array of devices in a typical computer -- screens and keyboards to communicate with humans , networking to communicate with other computers , hard drives to store gobs of data permanently , speakers , video camera , microphone -- they \'re all just literally separate devices that are electronically designed to be computer controlled and mechanically designed to fit snugly in the same case ( or on the same circuit board ) as the CPU / memory .']",0

Please explain like I'm five.","['A computer can generate a random number by using a program that uses a certain algorithm, which is a set of steps that can be followed to solve a problem or complete a task. The algorithm uses various inputs, such as the current time or other data that is changing constantly, to generate a seemingly random number. Although the number that is generated may seem random, it is actually based on a set of predetermined rules and is not truly random. This is because a computer is a machine and follows a set of instructions, so it is not capable of truly random behavior. However, for most purposes, the numbers that a computer generates using a random number generator are good enough because they are very difficult to predict and are not repeating in a pattern that is noticeable. So, to answer your question, a computer generates a random number using a program and an algorithm, but the number is not truly random. However, it is random enough for most purposes.']",1
How does a computer delete data ? When you uninstall and empty your recycle bin what happens to the data ? Where does it go ? Does it get vaporized or just stored somewhere else or what ? Edit : Thanks ! Totally makes sense now ! Explain like I'm five.,"['When you delete a file on a computer, the operating system (such as Windows or MacOS) marks the space that file was using as available to be overwritten with new data. This means that the file is not actually removed from the hard drive or other storage device, but the system simply no longer keeps track of it and considers the space it was using to be free to use again.\n\nWhen you empty the recycle bin, you are deleting the files permanently, so the operating system marks the space they were using as available to be overwritten. This means that the data is not actually removed from the hard drive, but it is no longer accessible and the system considers the space it was using to be free to use again.\n\nTo really delete data from a hard drive or other storage device, you would need to use a special tool that actually overwrites the data with new information. This process is called ""wiping"" the drive, and it is typically done to make sure that the data cannot be recovered by someone else.\n\nSo, to explain it like you\'re five: When you delete a file or empty the recycle bin, it\'s like the computer is taking a piece of paper and putting it in a special box where it can\'t be seen anymore. But the paper is still there, and someone could still find it if they really tried. To really get rid of the paper, you would have to take it and write something else on top of it so that the original information can\'t be read anymore. That\'s what wiping a drive does.']",1
How does a computer delete data ? When you uninstall and empty your recycle bin what happens to the data ? Where does it go ? Does it get vaporized or just stored somewhere else or what ? Edit : Thanks ! Totally makes sense now ! Explain like I'm five.,"['Your computer tracks the location of all the data on your hard - drive ( technically , it \'s a table on your harddrive that describes the harddrive contents and locations ) . It does this so it can track what areas of the harddrive are still free to store new data in . When you delete something , the data is n\'t actually removed from the hard - drive , instead , the OS tells that table to drop the entry relating to that data . Say I have a textfile named "" word.txt "" . On this table there \'s an entry that says something like "" the file word.txt is at location < x > on this drive "" . When word.txt is deleted , that entry is dropped . HOWEVER , the 1 \'s and 0 \'s representing word.txt is still in the same place , and it will stay there until another program comes along and requests hard drive space , and that section of the harddrive that contained word.txt happens to get used . There are programs you can use which will scan your harddrive for these files and perform a true delete on them ( by writing all 0 \'s to the location the file was stored ) . This truly deletes the file and makes it practically unrecoverable . I say practically because there are some theoretical ways a person could still recover the data , but they \'re highly scientific and prohibitively expensive , and would never actually be used except in the most extreme circumstances ( think multi - billion dollar deals falling through due to lost data or something )', 'Think of a hard drive as an encyclopedia , and the files as entries in that encyclopedia . The computer needs to look in the encyclopedia \'s index to know where to find a particular entry . When a computer says it is deleting a file , all it is really doing is deleting the reference to the entry in the index . Since the computer can no longer find a mention of a particular entry in the index , it stops looking and assumes there \'s no such entry to be found , even if the entry itself is completely intact . This also means that new entry can take part ( or even all ) of the space used by the previous entry . Eventually , newer entries will likely overwrite that space . This is also why you can buy programs that "" undelete "" files from your hard drive . Instead of relying solely on the index , they go through your hard drive , and find everything they can .', 'You could picture memory as a series of switches that you can set to one or zero ( or on / off if you prefer ) . Data is just a set of zeroes and ones . Your computer keeps track of which data is on which switches . So let \'s say your memory is 10 switches . Initially they \'re all at zero : 0000000000 Then you write a file ( data ) on the first 5 switches . Let \'s say your data is 10011 : 1001100000 ----- The dashes mark which part is used by that file . Now you store a second file , only 3 switches this time : 011 . you put it next to the first file : 1001101100 -----+++ Dashes mark the first file , plus signs mark the second . The last two switches are still unused . Now you delete the first file . A normal home computer will do nothing to the data , it will simply say "" this part where the file used to be is now available "" , like this : 1001101100 + + + See how the data is still there , but not marked as used anymore . Now you put another file , four switches:1100 , right at the beginning since it \'s marked as available . 1100101100 ~~~~ + + + See how the first four switches are now the new file and the 5th switch still keeps its value from the previous file ( but is marked as available ) . ---------- So that \'s for a regular home computer . In some sensitive cases , you just want the data to actually be erased from the switches , or else someone might still be able to read it . What your computer would do in that case is not only mark the space as unused , but also write rubbish in there , so that the old information disappears . So , we left it like this : 1100101100 ~~~~ + + + And if we want to securely delete the third file we wrote ( marked with the ~ \'s ) we mark it as available and overwrite the data with rubbish , such as 1010 : 1010101100 + + + See how the space is marked as available , and the information is also changed . It \'s better to write rubbish than put them all to zero or something , because there are ways to read the switch and see not only its current position , but also the previous one ( because of slight differences in the magnetism ) . So you \'d actually write a different rubbish set several times to make it completely secure .']",0

Computers store data using bits, which are units of information that can have one of two values: 0 or 1. When we group several bits together, we can represent different types of data, such as letters, numbers, and symbols. One way that computers can represent letters and numbers is by using a code called ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange). ASCII is a standard that assigns a unique number to each letter, number, and symbol in the English language. For example, the ASCII code for the letter ""A"" is 65, the ASCII code for the letter ""B"" is 66, and so on. So when a computer sees a binary code like 01100001, it knows that this code represents a letter because it has been programmed to recognize the ASCII codes for letters. In this case, the computer knows that 01100001 is the ASCII code for the letter ""a"". I hope this helps to explain how computers know whether a binary code represents a letter or a number.

"How does a computer process prioritize interleaved OS processes ? How does your computer determine the priority and timing of what applications running on your OS ?

Explain like I'm five.","['When a computer is running multiple processes at the same time, it needs to decide which process to work on first. The process that the computer chooses to work on first is called the ""scheduled"" or ""running"" process.\n\nThere are several ways that a computer can decide which process to schedule next. One way is to use a ""priority"" system, where each process is assigned a priority level, and the computer always schedules the process with the highest priority level first.\n\nAnother way is to use a ""time-sharing"" system, where each process is given a certain amount of time to run, and then the computer switches to another process. This helps to ensure that all processes get a fair amount of time to run, even if some processes have a higher priority level.\n\nThe ""best effort"" approach means that the computer will try its best to run all processes as quickly as possible, but it might not always be able to do so. For example, if there are a lot of processes running at the same time, the computer might not have enough resources (such as CPU or memory) to run all of them at the same speed. In this case, the computer might have to slow down some processes in order to keep others running smoothly.\n\nOverall, the way that a computer processes and schedules different processes is a very complex topic, and there are many different approaches that can be taken.

You can read about the algorithm used in the Linux kernel by searching for Linux "" Completely Fair Scheduler "" ( that \'s the name of the algorithm , since 2010 or so ) . The theory behind this algorithm is that you have two basic types of processes : interactive and non - interactive . Interactive processes are programs you \'re using , like your web browser , word processor , etc . - they normally sit there doing nothing , until you press a key or click with the mouse , then they \'re really busy . In contrast , other programs might be busy in the background , doing things like encoding a DVD , backing up your hard disk , and downloading a torrent . These processes are non - interactive , their goal is to get a lot of work done , not to be responsive . The "" Completely Fair Scheduler "" works by giving higher priority to tasks that have n\'t used a lot of cpu time recently . So this automatically makes interactive processes more responsive - when a program sits around doing nothing while it waits for you to press a key , then when you do press a key it becomes the highest priority process until it \'s done processing the key . In contrast , a DVD encoding process steals all available idle cpu time , so when you press a key in your mail reader , the DVD encoding process temporarily becomes much lower priority until your mail reader is done .', 'When an operating system starts a process , it is assigned a "" priority "" . Think of it as a number from 1 to 10 , where 10 is the most important process , and 1 is the least important .

Some materials allowed us to control * where * it would go . The transistor is a special device that acts as a switch . It has 3 connections : input , output , and on * . If you have a power source attached to the input , and you attached the power source to the ' on ' connection , it would allow that power to flow from the input to the output , kind of like a valve .

We take a lot of switches and put them together to count numbers in a system called [ * Binary * ] ( URL_0 ) Binary lets us store information . These switches can also be used to make decisions ( as described above ) . Suppose you have a set of transistors ( which we 'll describe with 0s and 1s ): 0000 abcd < - switch names Let say this represents a decision that the microcontroller makes . * If switch a is on , then we 'll add a number to another one . * If switch b is on , then we 'll subtract that number from another * If switch c is on , we 'll multiply them * If switch d is on , we 'll divide them So we have our two numbers : 2 and 3 and our switch set is : 0100 and we know that means that we should subtract the first number from the second . So we get 3 - 2 = 1 If our switch were 0010 We know we have to multiply the two numbers : 3 * 2 = 6 Since we can make decisions based on what switches are set , and we can set switches using electricity , we can use electricity to make decisions .

This could involve making smaller payments over a longer period of time or restructuring the terms of the debt in some other way.\r\n\r\nUsing foreign exchange markets: A country may also be able to pay off its debt by using the foreign exchange markets to buy back its own currency. For example, if a country has borrowed money in U.S. dollars and its own currency appreciates against the dollar, it may be able to use its own currency to buy back the dollars it needs to pay off its debt.\r\n\r\nSeeking assistance from international organizations: In some cases, a country may seek assistance from international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in order to pay off its debt. The IMF can provide loans to countries experiencing financial difficulties, which can be used to pay off debt.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.']",1

Benign tumors can usually be removed and do not usually come back.\r\n\r\nOther times, these tumors are malignant, which means they are cancerous and can spread to other parts of the body.

When melanoma spreads to other parts of the body, it can damage or destroy the tissues and organs it invades. For example, if melanoma spreads to the brain, it can cause headaches, seizures, and other problems with brain function. If it spreads to the lungs, it can cause trouble breathing. If it spreads to the liver, it can cause liver damage. When these organs are damaged or not working properly, it can make it hard for the body to function and can lead to death.\r\n\r\nAs for why some tumors are benign and others are malignant, it is not fully understood. It is thought that certain changes in the DNA of cells can cause them to become cancerous, but more research is needed to understand exactly what causes these changes and how to prevent them.']",1

Well , as long as the air around you is cooler than you are you will naturally cool off . In the same way that if you mix hot and cold water you get warm water , the heat in your body mixes with the cooler air around you and reduces your temperature and increases the temperature of the air . This works well until the air directly next to your skin is the same temperature as your body . That warm air needs to move away so more cool air can get close to your and cool you off .

A fan can slowly heat a room by using a process called convection. Convection is when heat is transferred by the movement of a fluid, like air. When a fan is turned on, it starts to blow air around the room. The air that is blown by the fan is usually at a slightly higher temperature than the air in the rest of the room. As the warmer air from the fan mixes with the cooler air in the room, the overall temperature of the air in the room begins to rise. This process can be compared to stirring a pot of soup on the stove. When you stir the soup, the hot liquid on the bottom of the pot mixes with the cooler liquid on the top, and the overall temperature of the soup increases. So, by blowing warmer air around the room, a fan can slowly heat the room by using the process of convection. Does that help to understand how a fan can slowly heat a room?']",1
How does a fire cause a interstate highway to fall How did the fire lead the highway in Atlanta falling . Why does it look like such a clean spit ?

A bunch of steel reinforcement bars ( rebar ) are shaped and welded into a beam and it \'s placed into a mold into which they pour the concrete . Those beams are then placed between structural supports and metal decking is placed between them . The concrete roadway or road bed is then poured on top of the metal decking . This is all made of material that contracts and expands with heat so at both ends there are expansion joints . In this case it \'s just a giant compressible rubber gasket that \'s about 4 "" wide . Concrete is extremely strong when undergoing compressive forces but not so great when it \'s under a flexion load . The beams are cast in an arch so that when they are loaded(heavy stuff on top ) , the concrete is under a compressive load .

How does a float in fuel gauge accurately read fuel level if the car is moving and the fuel is sloshing around all the time ? So here 's how it a fuel gauge works : URL_0 How is this any accurate ? Please explain like I'm five.,"[""First of all , most fuel tanks nowadays are baffled , this is to stop the fuel sloshing about . The reason for this is that modern fuel injection cars must have a constant supply of fuel , if the fuel sloshed about and the pick up pipe is exposed and sucks in some air the engine will ( at best ) cough , potentially it could even stop completely , which is nt good .. Most of the time the fuel sender is placed somewhere near the middle of the tank , so that any effects are minimised . Nowadays the sender is n't directly connected to the gauge , the sender connects to an ECU ( typically the body module ) , this processes the signal from the sender and puts it on the canbus network from where it is picked up by the dash gauges . This does allow for a little processing of the data to go on . I would suggest the ECU probably smooths the signal to remove big spikes , thus giving a more reliable reading . Regardless of all of this in most cars ascending or descending a hill does usually cause the fuel gauge to give false readings . They are n't a very accurate indicator - just a rough guide , but that s good enough ."", ""The're not accurate ! It 's a fairly simple , old technology and it 's really a rough estimate .

It takes 3 - 4 hours to drain a fuel tank , so they program the body controller to be very slow at subtracting . - I do n't think tanks are actually baffled as much as others say . Tanks I 've seen use two pumps , with one pump filling a soda can shaped holding area to separate out air , and the other pump pulling from this slosh - resistant holding area . Some tanks are split by the driveshaft , and use a venturi to suck fuel out of the opposite side .""]",0
How does a float in fuel gauge accurately read fuel level if the car is moving and the fuel is sloshing around all the time ? So here 's how it a fuel gauge works : URL_0 How is this any accurate ? Please explain like I'm five.,"['A float in a fuel gauge is a simple device that is used to measure the amount of fuel in a tank. It consists of a small metal rod that is attached to a float, which is a small, buoyant ball. The float is connected to a rod that is connected to a gauge. When the fuel level in the tank increases, the float rises, causing the rod to move and the gauge to indicate that there is more fuel in the tank. When the fuel level decreases, the float falls, causing the rod to move and the gauge to indicate that there is less fuel in the tank.The movement of the float is not affected by the sloshing of the fuel, because the float is buoyant and will always rise or fall with the fuel level, regardless of any movement of the fuel. This is why the fuel gauge is able to accurately measure the fuel level, even when the car is moving and the fuel is sloshing around.']",1

However, modern video game discs are able to hold a lot of data, and two discs is enough space to fit all of the data that is needed to run GTA V. There are a few reasons why the game is able to fit on two discs: 1. Data compression: One way that the game developers were able to fit all of the data onto two discs is by using data compression techniques. This means that they were able to make the size of the data smaller by using algorithms that remove redundancies and unnecessary information. 2. Disc capacity: Modern video game discs, such as DVDs and Blu-ray discs, have a lot of capacity for storing data. A single DVD can hold up to 4.7 GB of data, and a single Blu-ray disc can hold up to 50 GB of data. This is more than enough space to fit all of the data that is needed to run GTA V. 3. Data loading: Another reason why the game is able to fit on two discs is that not all of the data needs to be loaded into the computer's memory at the same time. Instead, the game can load different parts of the data as needed, which helps to reduce the overall amount of space that is required.

How does a green screen work ? I mean why do n't they just use a normal white or black or whatever screen ? Explain like I'm five.,"['A green screen works by using a special kind of paint that is green in color and is applied to a large fabric or wall. When someone stands in front of the green screen, they are filmed or photographed against the green background.\r\n\r\nThe reason they use a green screen instead of a white or black screen is because green is a color that is not typically found in human skin tones or clothing. This makes it easier to separate the person from the green background when the image is processed on a computer.\r\n\r\nTo create a special effect, the computer can then take the green screen image and replace the green background with a different image or video.

How does a high share price benefit a company when it is raising funds?,"['A high share price can benefit a company when it is raising funds in several ways. First, it can make it easier for the company to raise money through a process called a ""secondary offering."" In a secondary offering, the company sells additional shares of its stock to the public, and the proceeds from the sale go directly to the company. If the company\'s share price is high, it may be able to sell fewer shares in order to raise the same amount of money, which can be more efficient and cost-effective.Second, a high share price can also make it easier for the company to raise money through debt financing. If the company\'s share price is high, it may be able to use its stock as collateral for a loan. This can be particularly beneficial if the company has a strong credit rating and can obtain a low interest rate on the loan.Finally, a high share price can also make it easier for the company to attract and retain top talent. Companies often use stock options as a way to incentivize and reward their employees, and if the share price is high, these options may be more valuable to employees. This can help the company attract and retain top talent, which can ultimately contribute to the company\'s success.']",1
How does a high share price benefit a company when it is raising funds?,"['Share price is based on demand.  Assuming the same amount of shares are made available for trade then stocks with a higher demand will have a higher price.  So say a company has 1000 shares in total and that company needs to raise $100. They decide to sell 100 shares for $1 to raise their $100. If there is demand for 100 shares for at least $1 then they achieve their goal. But if the market decides the shares in this company are only worth 50 cents then the company only raises $50. So where do they get the other $50 they needed? Well one option is to sell another 100 shares. The dilution comes about because in the first scenario the company retains ownership of 900 or 90% of the equity. In the second scenario it retains ownership of only 800 shares or 80% of the equity. The benefit to the company and shareholders of a higher price is basically just math. Any multiple of shares times a higher price means there is more value to owning those shares. Therefore they can sell fewer shares to raise the same amount.  A lot of starts up offer employees shares as part of their remuneration package because cash flow is typically tight when starting a new business. So if you\'re trying to attract the best and brightest it\'s easier to offer them shares if they are worth more than those of company with a similar opportunity down the road. Share price can also act as something of a credit score. In that a higher share price ""may"" reflect a more credit worthy company and therefore ""may"" make it easier for that company to obtain credit. All else being equal, it also makes it more expensive for a competitor to take over a company the higher the share price. So it can offer some defensive and offensive advantages.

"How does a jet engine work ? Is this different than a rocket engine ? Jet engine as in an airplane , rocket engine as in spacecraft . Explain like I'm five.","['Sure! A jet engine is a type of engine that helps propel airplanes through the air. It works by sucking in air at the front of the engine using a fan. The air is then mixed with fuel and burned in a combustion chamber, creating a hot gas. The hot gas is forced through a narrow opening, called a nozzle, which makes the gas accelerate and produce a high-speed jet of gas. This jet of gas coming out of the back of the engine creates a forward force on the engine, called thrust, which propels the airplane through the air.\n\nA rocket engine is similar to a jet engine in that it also produces thrust to propel a vehicle through the air or through space. However, a rocket engine does not need air to work because it carries its own oxygen to burn the fuel. This means a rocket engine can work in the vacuum of space, where there is no air. Rocket engines also tend to be more powerful than jet engines, which makes them better suited for use in space travel.']",1

These artificial neural networks sometimes have properties that are described as ' emergent ' - i.e. they were n't programmed to do some specific thing , but they do it anyway - leading some people to suggest that a larger , much more complicated neural network like the human brain might have emergent properties like ' consciousness ' and ' awareness ' .

How does a lender compute equity requirement for PMI?,"[""Private mortgage insurance (PMI) is typically required by lenders when a borrower puts down less than 20% as a down payment on a home loan. PMI is meant to protect the lender in the event that the borrower defaults on their mortgage.To determine the equity requirement for PMI, lenders typically consider the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of the mortgage. The LTV ratio is calculated by dividing the loan amount by the value of the property. For example, if a borrower is seeking a mortgage of $200,000 to purchase a home with a value of $250,000, the LTV ratio would be 80% ($200,000 / $250,000).Lenders generally require PMI when the LTV ratio exceeds 80%. In this case, the borrower would be required to pay PMI until they have built up enough equity in the property to bring the LTV ratio down to 80% or lower. This can be achieved by making mortgage payments, which reduce the outstanding balance on the loan, or by the value of the property appreciating, which increases the value of the collateral for the loan.It's worth noting that some lenders may have different requirements for PMI, so it's always a good idea to check with the lender to confirm their specific policies.""]",1

How does a limit order work for a credit spread?,"['A limit order is an order to buy or sell a security at a specific price or better. In the context of a credit spread, a limit order would be used to specify the maximum price at which you are willing to buy or sell the spread.For example, if you are considering a credit spread trade involving the purchase of a call option and the sale of a put option, you might place a limit order to buy the spread at a specific price or lower. This means that you are willing to pay up to that price for the spread, but you are not willing to pay more.If the market price of the spread falls below your limit price, your order will be executed and the trade will be completed. If the market price does not fall to your limit price, the order will not be filled and the trade will not be completed.In general, limit orders can be useful for managing risk in credit spread trades by allowing you to specify a maximum price at which you are willing to enter into a trade.

How does a measurement device use significant figures to measure something ? It ’s my first week in chemistry class for my next degree and my nursing - oriented brain is already struggling . Explain like I'm five. ,"['When we measure something, we use a tool like a ruler or a thermometer to get a number that tells us how big, heavy, hot, etc. the thing we are measuring is. Sometimes the numbers we get are very precise, like when we use a ruler to measure something to the nearest millimeter. Sometimes the numbers we get are not as precise, like when we use a thermometer to measure something to the nearest degree.\\n\\nTo make sure that we are using the right amount of precision when we measure something, we use a system called ""significant figures."" This helps us to know how accurate our measurements are.\\n\\nHere\'s how it works:\\n\\nCount the number of digits in the number that you are measuring. This includes all of the digits, even if some of them are zero.\\n\\nThe last digit in the number is called the ""uncertain digit."" This is because it is the digit that we are least certain about. For example, if you are measuring something to the nearest centimeter, the uncertain digit would be the one in the hundredths place (the last digit).\\n\\nAll of the other digits in the number are called ""certain digits."" These are the digits that we are more certain about.\\n\\nWhen you write down the number, you should include all of the certain digits and one uncertain digit. You should not include any more uncertain digits than this.\\n\\nFor example, if you measure something to be 3.14 centimeters, you would include all three of the certain digits (3, 1, and 4) and one uncertain digit (4). This would give you a measurement of 3.14 cm. If you measured something to be 3.141 cm, you would still include only one uncertain digit (1). This would give you a measurement of 3.14 cm.\\n\\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.\\n']",1
How does a measurement device use significant figures to measure something ? It ’s my first week in chemistry class for my next degree and my nursing - oriented brain is already struggling . Explain like I'm five. ,"['The point of significant figures is for error purposes . If you ’re using a ruler that is only marked along the inches and not half inches or lower for example , what do you do if the actual length of the object is 7.5436 inches ? The best you can do using the instrument is say that it ’s 8 inches long , but that ’s not quite right as you can clearly visualize that it ’s somewhere between 7 - 8 inches long . Margin Of Error is the term we assign to how far off you can be , and this usually amounts to about halfway between the two values . In the above example , your margin of error is a half inch , because if the actual length of the object is in fact 7.5 inches , you have no choice but to say it ’s 8 inches long with a margin of error of .5 inches . Meaning , your actual value can be anywhere between 7.5 to 8.5 inches long .', ""Significant figures are n't used by instruments , they are part of a measurement . If I measure something at 1000.1 mm plus or minus 5 mm , then there are three significant digits ( the first 1 and two zeroes ) . The last zero is just there to fill out the number , and the 1 after the decimal point is pointless ( sorry , math pun ) . Similarly , a measurement of 0.000123 has , at most , three significant digits ( 1,2,and 3 ) . Leading zeroes , trailing zeroes and digits which are outside the accuracy of measurement are not significant . They can still be important to establish the amplitude of the significant digits ."", 'Significant figures show how precise the measurement is . For example , I could say the nearest Starbucks is 2 miles away , when it was actually 1.812 miles away . Pretty close to what I said , but someone who listened to me might drive 2 miles and miss the Starbucks completely . Measurement devices which have more significant figures are more precise and thus more useful . However there is a limit to how many digits actually matter . Usually this is either 3 or 4 significant figures so that the maximum error is less than 0.1 % .']",0

I 'm not trying to be mean or insensitive , just genuinely wondering if it all boils down to calories in versus calories out . Explain like I'm five.","[""Thyroid problems can cause weight gain because the thyroid gland helps regulate your body's metabolism, which is the process that your body uses to turn food into energy. If your thyroid gland is not working properly, it can slow down your metabolism, which means that your body may not be able to burn calories as efficiently as it should. This can lead to weight gain, even if you are eating the same amount of calories as before. So, while calories are still important, they are not the only factor that can affect your weight. Your body's metabolism and hormonal balance can also play a role.""]",1
