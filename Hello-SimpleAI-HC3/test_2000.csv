14,14,"[""Generally speaking , among primates and most mammals , you can determine whether or not a species is naturally monogamous by the relative size of the male to the female . Gorilla , for example , have much larger males than females . They are polygamous . Same holds for Chimpanzees . This biological reason comes down to the fact that in a polygamous system , males have to compete for not only the best females but for all the females . Thus , being larger guarantees success . In a monogamous species , all males and females ( each roughly 50 % of the population ) have equal access , and males and females tend to be the same size . So , humans are naturally polygamous , from a biological perspective . But before you start blaming religion and society , recall that monogamy in humans actually predates religion and even agriculture as part of human society . So how do we explain this ? Well , consider the first humans who started living together in defined groups . Maybe they create a camp . Discovery of fire , etc . By this point , their tools and social structure has already put them on the apex of their environment . They have no natural predators anymore , and the population is already beginning to boom . Which means that back then ( as today ) there existed a certain scarcity of resources which would later be solved by agriculture . Now , when we have a scarcity of resources , we have competition . In this case , between two or more different GROUPS , or tribes , of humans . Which means that now we need to ensure that our tribe , not just the individual , is the most fit . This means that we need two things : a stable population size ( lots of warriors ) and genetic diversity ( healthy warriors ) . This does not happen if you have , say , a harem - type polygamous system . Because even though one man can get all the women in the tribe pregnant ( you know , if he HAS to ) , that 's going to ensure that the next generation has very low genetic diversity ( They 're all half - siblings ) . If this continues , one tribe is going to be significantly inbred , and we all know what that looks like . So , consider two tribes . One tribe , as part of their social structure , is fine with letting the chief ( biggest male ) have all the women . Another tribe , by chance , pairs up men and women via a ceremony ( early marriage ) . Each tribe lives 5 generations until they come together and have a war . Who is more likely to win ? The second tribe . Project this over a hundred and fifty thousand years of human pre - history , and it becomes advantageous for humans , who as animals are naturally polygamous , to become monogamous for the good of the tribe , which is a novel organizational level that genetics has n't accounted for . An voila , the paradox is solved . Sort of . See , monogamy was required for the survival of tribes and small social systems . But today , we no longer have tribes . We have vast and genetically diverse cities and towns and nations worth of potential sexual partners , and absolutely ZE - RO need to fear for long - term inbreeding . All the while , our animal brains are telling us to be polygamous , an instinct which is not likely to ever go away . Hence , you know , all sexual drama of the last ten thousand years . Why do we do it ? Because the social structure that were NECESSARY to keep tribes together and functional ( religion , government , etc ) became by necessity aligned with monogamy . And we have n't yet separated those two ideas . Yet being the key word . tl;dr : We are naturally polygamous . We once needed to be mongamous to survive .

We can ( and will have to ) move on , but at the moment its so amazingly cheap and easy that it 's hard to get people motivated to change ."", ""The issue is the transportation of fuel . If you separate an electric engine from its power source , you need to use a battery . That severely impedes the performance of an electric motor . The reality is that gasoline is easy to transport , produces a lot of power and is pretty stable and overall is n't that heavy ( as fuel is used the car 's weight will reduce ) ."", ""We first need a suitable alternative . There are many modes of locomotion , but they all have flaws . Electric cars are probably the future , but energy production or storage is the problem . As it stands , you just ca n't beat gasoline or CNG / LNG per cost to energy density and availability . Fuel cells are most efficient with hydrogen fuel , which is plentiful , but storing hydrogen is a bitch ; the molecule is so small that it vents through even solid steel bottles ! The higher the pressure , the faster it vents . And you can store more hydrogen in a solid medium than as a pure gas ( I do n't understand it either ) . The problem with storing it in a solid is that it 's bonding to the solid . How do you break the bonds ? That 's why cars that run on water are impossible - to separate the bonds is more energy intensive than the energy you get out of it . Alternative fuels for a fuel cell are n't efficient enough , are too expensive or exotic to produce , or depend on hydrocarbons ( gasoline ) . Batteries suck . Lithium is an exotic metal , rare on Earth . There 's one mine in China , and the only other mine on Earth is in Arizona , and that 's closed because of a nuclear materials accident in it . Batteries are slow to release energy , slow to charge , they 're not as energy dense as gasoline , their anodes suck and break down , and in general , the breakdown of the storage medium means they have a limited operational life and they 're expensive to replace . Lithium is also hugely reactive , especially with oxygen , and when they catch fire , they 're one of the hottest burning chemical reactions known . Solar cells are n't efficient enough , and weather makes them unreliable . Fine for gathering free energy when it 's available , you can slowly recharge your batteries while you 're parked at work , but not good enough to be the primary source . Ethanol takes more energy to make than it yields , and it means you have to decide between food or fuel . Converting cellulose to starch is a newly discovered and cheap technique , and if utilized , means we 'll end up cutting down the rain forests for ethanol fuel faster than they can be replanted and replenished . I consider this route an ecological disaster waiting to happen . I do n't mean the above scenario literally , but we would strip the land bare for efficiency and short shortsightedness . There is an alternative fuel that shows so much promise , Boeing is investing big and is poised to revolutionize aviation . They want to grow land plants that tolerate sea water . We 've polluted the oceans with so much phosphate , from fertilizer run - off , that they would n't need any additional fertilizer , and it will help reduce pollution in the oceans . The plants are naturally oily , and are being bred to maximize this . Boeing wants to grow bio fuel for aviation . They 'll greenify the arid lands and deserts ( off the coasts of Africa , where they 're launching their entire operation ) , and provide income for impoverished nations . But that 's still a hydrocarbon ... Lockheed claims they 'll have a 100 MW fusion generator the size of a shipping container by 2017 . That 's a bold claim , but this is a company that is notorious for working under tight wraps . These guys are n't the frauds who make bold claims , collect investor money , and disappear . If they 're willing to publicly announce a due date , I suspect they have a fully functional prototype . Anyway , while you 're not going to fit this device under the hood , it does mean alternative fuel synthesis becomes cheap and feasible . And being so very small , I can see these mounted on mega ships , replacing their bunker fuel burning engines , and a future where they might experiment mounting one on an aircraft ( an aircraft carrier generates 140 MW from their reactors , a Boeing 747 consumes 160 MW at cruising altitude and speed ) .

Then students progress to sixth - form college , which is usually for two years , and they take their ' A - levels ' at the end . So yeah , an A - level is a higher qualification , and I guess the equivalent of a US high school diploma . If you take any one exam , it is n't possible for your performance to dictate whether you get a GCSE or an A - level . ( Your performance only determines whether you get an F / B / A GCSE )"", '"" O Levels "" no longer exist , they were replaced by GCSE \'s .

If we wish to continue with academic education ( as opposed to work or more vocational education , which also becomes an option at this age ) , we pursue "" A levels "" for a further two years , until age 18 . Most people generally study for around 8 - 12 subjects at GCSE , and around 3 - 4 subjects at A Level . Hence , A level is much more specialised , and often people chose specific subjects in order to lead to a particular university major . ( For example , if you wished to study medicine at university , you would have had to have studied science subjects at A Level ) Also , certain subjects are compulsory at GCSE - everybody has to take maths , English and some science , for example . At A level we get absolutely free choice to study whichever subjects we want . EDIT : I should add that "" O Level "" used to stand for "" Ordinary Level ( of education ) "" and "" A Level "" for "" Advanced Level "" .', ""I think the big difference is that in the UK mandatory education ends at 16 . In the US it 's 18 . GCSE 's are the qualifications at the end of mandatory education in the UK . You will probably take between 8 - 12 subjects . Math and English ( Literature and/or Language ) are mandatory , you take science - Biology , Chemistry , Physics , and depending on the difficulty you sit this counts for either 2 or 3 GCSE 's , then you take Geography and/or History , usually at least one language French / German / Spanish , then some other subjects , I.T , R.E ( religious education ) , D.T ( design and technology ) . There are some others but I ca n't remember . At 16 you finish school , which is the place where you wear uniform , and then you have a choice of either going to sixth form college , going to technical college , or simply getting a job and starting work . Sixth form colleges only take people aging from 16 - 18 and tend to focus on academic qualifications , which most of the time will be A - levels . You choose 4 subjects for the first year and sit an exam at the end called AS - levels . Then in your final year you take 3 subjects and your AS - grade is added to the grade of your final year 's work to determine your A - level grade . A - level grades are what British universities require to gain entry to academic courses . For example , to study most subjects at Oxford you 'll need 3 A grades . On highly competitive courses they 'll also look at your AS level grades and GCSE grades to determine who gets the places , with the possibility of an interview process as well . If you go to a technical college you 'll probably study one subject , something vocational for 2 years and get a qualification called a BTEC at the end . This could be a plumbing , bricklaying , hairdressing , beauty treatments and a whole other range of things . Most people going to these colleges at 16 are n't looking to go to university but get a qualification that will let them enter the workplace at 18 . That said many of these colleges also teach A - levels because older learners will no longer be eligible to go to sixth form , so if they 're looking to take an academic route they 'll go to a standard college to take A - levels . If you leave school at 16 you 're not going to be qualified to do much , but for many people it 's the only option , that said there is always the option of being trained in something vocational on the job with an apprenticeship or some other on the job qualification . Some sixth form colleges might totally forgo the A - level system and teach the international baccalaureate instead which adds an added layer of complication , which is an academic qualification recognised by British universities . There are also multiple recognised exam boards for A - level and GCSE qualifications meaning students in different schools will take different syllabuses and have different requirements in terms of coursework assessment and examinations so it 's not really all that simple .

A rainbow has light we ca n\'t see in the area outside the violet part and also light we ca n\'t see outside the red part . The light just outside the violet part of the rainbow is what we call ultraviolet ( black light ) , and the part just outside the red is infra - red . The main way that black light is produced these days is through those tube - based black light lamps you see that are violet colored . They are basically just fluorescent lamps . The way they work is that they have electrodes on either end of the tube , and the tube is filled with a gas ( usually argon ) and some mercury vapor . Electricity passes through the electrodes and through the gas and pumps energy into the gas , exciting it . The gas will release the energy , and when it does so , it releases it as light . The color of the light released is very specific and depends on the particular chemicals used . The reason that mercury is in these lamps is that when you excite it in this way , it will release a lot of its light in the ultraviolet band . Mercury produces light at some other colors ( as does the argon ) , too ... so the tube is colored to filter out some of that light and leave just the violet and ultraviolet light . By the way , fluorescent lights you might have in the home or office work on the same principle , but with an addition . The white "" paint "" you see on the tube is a chemical coating ( phosphors ) which absorb ultraviolet light and then release that energy back as visible light .

The publisher felt that it was too racy of a name , so they called it The God Particle . Back in the 60 's , physicists were exploring the inside of atoms to figure out how the whole universe worked . Over time , they figured out a few things here and there and they started fitting them together , much like a puzzle . They called their current working model of all physics the Standard Model . The Higgs Boson is what give an object mass ( how much space in the universe it occupies ) * . It is literally the last part of the Standard Model that been predicted but have not yet been found . It 's important because if we do n't find the boson , the whole Standard Model will literally collapse upon itself and the last hundred or so years of quantum mechanic research will have been for naught . * * As to how it work :* * invisible , non - existanal particles ( boson in this case ) are always popping in and out of existence all the time . Some of these particles will react strongly to a force , such as a magnet , and will create a field of density around a point . This is why magnets can hold onto a refrigerator when touching , but ca n't when 2 feet away . These particles are responsible for the two bits of metal holding onto each other . Physicist can test whether or not these forces can actually influence our world ( like magnetism ) by dumping a lot of energy into a controlled environment . Because matter is convertible to energy ( E = MC^2 ) , we can visualize matter as a sort of frozen ice cube of energy which we can melt or freeze matter with the right application of energy . What they 're doing at CERN is dumping a huge amount of energy into a system to essentially force the invisible particles into existence , not unlike how pumping a huge amount of gas into an air tank turns it into liquid . If the theoretical Higgs Boson pop into existence at CERN , it 'll prove that a field ( like a magnet ) is what cause bits of matter to have more or less mass than other bits of matter . But instead of being focused on a single point ( like a magnetic rock ) the Higgs Field should stretch out across the universe evenly and interact with everything in existence . Some particles of matter will take up X amount of space and others will take up Y amount , and no matter where you are in the universe you 'll alway have that amount of mass occupying space . As to why it 's only now we 're about to discover the Higgs , it 's purely because nobody has built a big enough environment capable of holding the energy needed force the Boson into existence .

It 's actually possible for a single point in space to have a ridicules amount of weight despite it have very little mass . Most of what I 've written still stands , but consider the problem of the Higgs Field like this : light is unique for having no mass , thus allowing it to travel at a tremendous speed and being unmolested by the Field . A rock in space ( a vacuum and for argument 's stake with nil gravitational forces ) will never travel nearly as fast because it has mass and will interact with the Higgs Field much more . A planet will be bogged down even more so because it has a huge amount of mass .

79,79,"[""The original IRA was active from 1919 to 1922 during the Irish Civil War . In 1969 a new organization called the Provisional IRA emerged , whose intention was to use acts of violence against the police and against civilians to encourage the British to withdraw from Northern Ireland , allowing Northern Ireland to unify with the Republic of Ireland , and making all of Ireland a united republic , free of British rule . They 've been on cease - fire since 1997 , they supported the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 , and they disarmed in 2005 . They are perceived negatively because they undertook a campaign of terrorist violence , and killed many civilians in Northern Ireland and elsewhere in the UK . By no means were they the only bad people in The Troubles , and their motivations and the circumstances that led to their existence are pretty complicated . Jeremy Corbyn 's relationship to the IRA comes from him being closely related to Sinn Fein , a political party in Ireland and Northern Ireland who are the biggest pro - Republic party in Northern Ireland . Sinn Fein and the IRA have always been linked , although Sinn Fein denies any formal ties . Sinn Fein is the legitimate face of Irish Republicanism , the IRA was the militant face ."", ""# HISTORY Hello my friend . The IRA is the Irish Republican Army and takes many forms throughout history . A quick view of the history . In 1171 the Pope made the King of England the Lord of Ireland ( ELI5 the leader of Ireland ) . With this the Kingdom of England took over Ireland . The Irish did n't like this and they rebelled . This got a lot worse when the religious divide came . After the Act of Union with Ireland 1800 the Irish were represented in Westminster . In 1885 the Home Rule Party was formed , they wanted a federal British Empire with an Imperial Parlaiment in Westminster and a Parliament in Dublin . This is similar to federal states like USA . The HRP was relplaced by other parties who became more pro inderpendance . In 1916 the Irish had there first rising in a long time and the Provisional Republic of Ireland stood a proud nation among the nations of the world for 3 days . # TYPES OF IRA In 1918 another rising came , this one was much more succesful . This was the first IRA , or the Old IRA . They were fighting for an independant Ireland . They made peace with the British and the Irish Free State was formed , this free state was owned by the British Crown . The treaty led to a split in the IRA and the anti treaty members remained IRA and the pro treaty members became the National Army of Ireland . The Irish and British put down the IRA . After the 1920s the action died down with moderate acts of terror both in the Irish Free State ( Southern Ireland ) and Northern Ireland . In the 1960s action kicked up again over problems of civil rights in Northern Ireland for the Catholics , a lot of the concerns were valid . A split developed in the IRA following the failed Border Campaign , that eneded in 1962 . The IRA split into two groups ; Provisional IRA ( PIRA or Provos ) , left wing socialsits and the more popular of the IRAs , when people refer to the IRA they often mean the PIRA . Official IRA ( OIRA ) , marxist and even further to the left to PIRA . In the 1980s the PIRA had another split ; PIRA Continuity Irish Republican Army ( CIRA ) this was over disagrements to not taking seats in the Republic of Ireland . PIRA made peace with the British in 1997 and this peace led to the Real IRA ( rIRA ) people who ca n't accpet the peace . Finally in 2012 a New IRA ( NIRA ) formed from all the splinter groups of the IRAs ( which is n't a lot of people ) . # WHY THE PIRA ARE UNLIKED The PIRA are unliked because they brought violence when people wanted peace , even in Northern Ireland they only had 13 % support ( Sinn Fein vote share in NI in the troubles ) . There was no need for the violence yet they brought it anyway . The PIRA had gang like control of Northern Ireland and were more like the Mafia than a liberation army . My Great Grandfather was made a refugue as he refused to pay the PIRA protection money . He was a Catholic Irish man from County Sligo who moved to County Derry . The PIRA were thugs . They targeted civilians and governemnt figures . # CORBYN AND THE PIRA Corbyn had a close relationship with the IRA , so close MI5 and MI6 ( British domestic and foreign secret service ) opened a case agaisnt him an spied on him , an elected member of Westminster under MI5 and MI6 investigation . After the Brighton Hotel Bombing , an attack that killed four tories including one MP and was the attempt by the IRA to kill the entire government of the UK , thankfully they failed . A few short weeks later Corbyn invited form prisoners who were PIRA into Parlaiment ! Corbyn worked to legitimise the violent terorist members of the Catholic Community , not the SDLP who wanted a peaceful solution . Corbyn voted agaisnt peace ( Anglo - Irish treaty 1985 ) he wanted an Irish revolutuion to conqure all Ireland ."", ""Irish Republican Army .

110,110,"['This summer I used a loan from my 401(k) to help pay for the down payment of a new house. We planned on selling a Condo a few months later, so we only needed the loan for a short period but wanted to keep monthly payments low since we would be paying two mortgages for a few months. I also felt like the market might take a dip in the future, so I liked the idea of trying to cash out high and buy back low (spoiler alert: this didn\'t happen). So in July 2017 I withdrew $17,000 from my account (Technically $16,850.00 principal and $150 processing fee) at an effective 4.19% APR (4% rate and then the fee), with 240 scheduled payments of $86.00 (2 per month for 10 years). Over the lifetime of the loan the total finance charge was $3,790, but that money would be paid back into my account. I was happy with the terms, and it helped tide things over until the condo was sold a few months later. But then I decided to change jobs, and ended up having to pay back the loan ~20 weeks after it was issued (using the proceeds from the sale of the condo). During this time the market had done well, so when I paid back the funds the net difference in shares that I now owned (including shares purchased with the interest payments) was $538.25 less than today\'s value of the original count of shares that were sold to fund the loan. Combined with the $150 fee, the overall ""cost"" of the 20 week loan was about 4.05%. That isn\'t the interest rate (interest was paid back to my account balance), but the value lost due to the principal having been withdrawn. On paper, my account would be worth that much more if I hadn\'t withdrawn the money. Now if you extrapolate the current market return into 52 weeks, you can think of that loan having an APR ""cost"" of around 10.5% (Probably not valid for a multi year calculation, but seems accurate for a 12 month projection). Again, that is not interest paid back to the account, but instead the value lost due to the money not being in the account. Sure, the market could take a dip and I may be able to buy the shares back at a reduced cost, but that would require keeping sizable liquid assets around and trying to time the market. It also is not something you can really schedule very well, as the loan took 6 days to fund (not including another week of clarifying questions back/forth before that) and 10 day to repay (from the time I initiated the paperwork to when the check was cashed and shares repurchased). So in my experience, the true cost of the loan greatly depends on how the market does, and if you have the ability to pay back the loan it probably is worth doing so. Especially since you may be forced to do so at any time if you change jobs or your employment is terminated.']",0,real

It claimed that the reason why poor nations were poor , was because of rich nations who always got the better deal in trading . Trading with the global north would make the south poorer so they should instead try to be more protectionist . Nations of the global south tried to instil the NIEO ( New International Economic Order)- URL_1 through the UN . It wanted to change trade laws so that poor nations would benefit instead of mainly rich nations . While the Modernization theory has been pretty much disproved , the issues of the dependancy were more relevant . The only nations to have become developed from the global south did so with a lot of protectionism to protect their industries ( Korea , Singapore , Taiwan ) . However in the 70 \'s new developments were happening in the world . The first 2 theories I spoke about were based on Keynesian principles . They beleived that respobsibility for development should come through the state . However in the 70 \'s and 80 \'s , Neo - liberal principles became increasingly popular in the West . The * * Neo - liberal Theory * * beleived that development should come through private companies and increased market liberization . It beleived that with less borders , the wealth of nations would increasingly became evened out . The Bretton Woods institutions encouraged Neoliberal policies in the world . It took advantage on the Debt crisis to enforce it on countris . -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Quick explanation of the debt crisis- In the late 60 \'s and 70 \'s , Western banks were becoming increasingly rich . They had less barriers with the increase of neo - liberal policies and less government intervention . Banks were also avoiding tax by having headquarters in tax havens such as Switzerland or the Cayman Islands . At the same time OPEC countries ( 3rd world oil producing nations ) were limiting production to increase the price of oil . They made millions of profits and put it into the banks . The banks now had alot of available money so they made alot of loans to 3rd world nations . 3rd world naions took advantage of these loans , as banks had no strings attached unlike money recieved from the superpowers the USA or the USSR . However the bubble burst and the world economy went into recession in the 70 \'s . 3rd world nations did not make the desired profit on their investments , and they were faced with large debt during a recession . Interest rates were increased aswell -------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Bretton Woods institutions tried to "" help "" countries by instilling the Structural Adjustment Programs ( SAP ) to pay off the debt . In these programs , if nations instilled neoliberal principles such as cut spending on education and health , lowered their currency and wages to favour exports , privatized their companies etc . they would have to pay a smaller amount . Neoliberal policies have had mixed results . Some nations have seen alot of growth ( East Asia and the BRICS ) , while others have actually gotten poorer ( alot of Africa , parts of Asia and Latin America ) . It has also increased polarization of wealth in the world . However it has also challenged the Dependancy Theory as South nations have emerged while Western nations today are growing at slow rates , some even receeding . ------------------------------------------------------------------------- So as you can see its not straightforward to explain why Africa ( and other LEDC nations ) are less developed . Countries are not in a vacuum but are influenced by world trade and economy and in large cases poor nations have little say in thier economic destinies .', 'it does not help that the countries were artificially created and did not naturally evolve .', ""I 'm no expert , so until one comes along [ here 's a link ] ( URL_0 ) to a pretty decent ars technica forum thread discussing this exact topic .""]",0,real
116,116,"['The following is a good explanation paraphrased from Raymond Smullyan \'s forever undecided . Suppose I told you the following statement S : S = "" You do not believe S "" Then you might think : Suppose I could never hold two contradictory beliefs . Then if I believe S , that would be doing the opposite of what S says . So then I would believe S , but by doing so , I would also have to believe the opposite . That would be a contradictory belief , and I ca n\'t have those . Therefore , IF I can never hold two contradictory beliefs THEN I do n\'t believe S. But since the latter is what S says , the following holds : IF I can never hold two contradictory beliefs THEN S is true and I do n\'t believe it . or equivalently You ca n\'t be both consistent ( hold no contradictory beliefs ) and complete ( believe all true things ) . It turns out that if you replace the word believe with prove , the same thing happens in math . That \'s Godel \'s first incompleteness theorem . Now suppose you DID believe that your beliefs were totally free from contradictions . Then you could continue . I have discovered that if I am free from contradictions then S is true . Since I AM free from contradictions , then S is true . Then I must believe what S says . Since S says I do n\'t believe S , I also do n\'t believe S. So I hold a contradictory belief . This is Godel \'s second incompleteness theorem . If you ever did believe / prove that you hold no contradictory beliefs , you would end up holding a contradictory belief . I would recommend that you read that over slowly if it does n\'t sink in at first . It gets really confusing when you talk about believing statements about belief , so going slowly helps .', 'The first thing you need to know is that proofs require assumptions . If you never assumed something , the only things you could prove would be "" tautologies "" , or statements that are true because of their structure . For instance , "" a bird is a bird "" . This sentence reveals nothing about birds or the world . You could replace "" a bird "" with anything , even stuff that does n\'t exist , and the statement is still true . Once we start assuming things , we can start making interesting statements about the world . For instance , if we assume that every number in our system has a number that can add with it to get zero , then we can start talking about subtraction and negative numbers , and we can start solving equations like x + a = b. These statements that we assume are commonly referred to as axioms if they are about numbers , or postulates if they are about geometrical objects . We have intuitions about the way our number system works . We make those intuitions explicit with the axioms we choose . With me so far ? Now , we can take our axioms and our logic and start constructing proofs . Proofs are anxiety producing for many geometry students . The good thing is that whenever you establish something to be true using a proof , then that statement MUST be true in your world with your axioms . Now , is the converse true ? Is EVERY true statement provable ? This is where the first incompleteness theorem comes in . It says that no matter how many axioms you come up with , so long as ~~there are n\'t infinitely many ( according to a special definition)~~ they are all decidable , then there will always be at least one true arithmetic statement which is n\'t provable . The second one goes even farther . It says that if you take a finite set of axioms , and you explicitly write down the rules of logic and take THOSE rules as axioms , then you can never decide WITHIN that system whether or not the system has no contradictions in it . Meaning that as soon as we formalize our logic , we can not show that our logic does n\'t break down at some point . Please extend and correct as necessary .', 'You know the statement "" I am lying ? "" It turns out it is actually possible to create a mathematical statement which asserts itself not to be a true mathematical statement . Moreover , this is possible with * any * system powerful enough to make the kind of statements that can be made with standard mathematical systems . This means that it is never possible to express all truths about the system from inside the system itself , because it will always be possible to make contradictions like these .']",0,real
117,117,"['Nuclear power works by the fissioning ( splitting ) of uranium-235 atoms with neutrons . Every atom that fissions releases a little bit of heat and , on average , 2.5 new neutrons . This means it can be an exponential process , rapidly generating a lot of energy . The nuclear core in most power plants ( i.e. Pressurized Water Reactors or Boiling Water Reactors ) is made of rods of low - enriched uranium . This means that the amount of the isotope U-235 is raised from < 1 % ( natural uranium ) to 5 % ( the rest is U-238 , which does n\'t fission ) . By raising the level , this means that they can use regular water as a "" moderator . "" The moderator helps keep the reaction going by slowing down the neutrons produced by the U-235 fissioning — U-235 fissions more readily from slower neutrons , which means you need less of it to keep a reaction going . ( The reasons for this are interesting but perhaps a bit beyond explaining this at an ELI5 level , so just take it on faith that being in water makes the reaction work better . Note that this kind of reactor , one that uses regular water , is called a "" light water "" reactor , to distinguish it from reactors that use "" heavy water "" — deuterium oxide . Such reactors do not require enriching the fuel , but are generally not as good for power purposes . ) In a nuclear bomb , you want a nuclear reaction that releases all of the energy very , very quickly . In a reactor , you do n\'t want that , obviously . You want a reaction that goes from zero to "" pretty big "" fairly quickly , but then stays more or less constant . The way to achieve that constancy is through both engineering the reactor so that it is harder for it to fission like crazy ( there are various ways to do this ) , but also through control rods . These are rods made up of substances that readily absorb neutrons , like cadmium or boron . So one way to think of a reactor is as a neutron - producing machine . You want a good "" neutron economy , "" where you have enough neutrons to keep the reaction going , but not so many neutrons that it gets out of control . The use of control rods is the main way that the neutron economy can be affected directly by the operators , either dialing it up or down as they need to . There are other engineering tricks for getting more efficient reactions out of less fuel , like having neutron - reflecting material surrounding the fuel . As a consequence of all of this fissioning , the reactor generates a lot of heat . Depending on the type of reactor ( i.e. Pressurized Water Reactor or Boiling Water Reactor ) , the heat is siphoned out of the core in various ways , then turned into steam , then put through a turbine . To add and remove fuel , you shut down the whole reaction ( insert all of the control rods ) . Then you have an remote - automated machine that removes those fuel rods . This all takes place under water , because after being inside the reactor for any appreciable amount of time , the fuel rods get very radioactive . The rods are then transported ( again , still under water ) into a separate spent fuel pool ( usually near the reactor building ) , where they sit for about 5 years or so . This allows them to get rid of the worst of their radiation and they can then be removed and put into dry cask storage . Adding new fuel is not such a big deal , because the fuel is barely radioactive at all before it has been inside of a reactor . They have ways of removing the tops of the reactor vessels and machines to insert the new fuel rods . In many localities you can get a tour of nuclear power plants just by asking nicely . I heavily recommend it , because until you see it in person , it is easy to abstract all of this into the simple flow - chart diagrams you \'ll find on Wikipedia or the like . In person they are very impressive , very large facilities . I got to tour the Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant a couple of years ago and found it quite interesting , both because of its size as well as the boring banality of it . Most nuclear reactors are deadly ... boring , and operate under completely uninteresting conditions nearly 100 % of the time , and that , paradoxically , makes seeing them in person kind of interesting .', 'Nuclear power works like any other boiler - in a thermal cycle , water is boiled into steam , which transfers fluid to mechanical energy in turbines , then the water is pumped back up to pressure and fed back into the reactor . In the core , heat is generated by the fissioning of Uranium atoms . U-235 is a * fissile * fuel , meaning the introduction of one neutron tips it over instability and it breaks into fragments . Those fragments carry with them a large portion of the fission energy in the form of kinetic energy . The energized , heavy fragments ( roughly 1/2 the mass of Uranium ) collide with other particles in the fuel element and it heats up ... a LOT . The fuel is composed of Uranium pellets in the form of a ceramic , such that the fuel will not melt under these high temperatures . Uranium content in the fuel is enriched , or concentrated , to a certain percentage of U-235 . The degree of enrichment dictates how likely the fuel is to fission , due to the higher fissile isotope content . Upon each fission , multiple neutrons are released along with the heavy fragments that deposit their kinetic energy ( heat generation ) . Those fission - born neutrons are a new * generation * of neutrons , and lead to subsequent fissions in the core . That process of neutron absorption - fission - neutron release - neutron absorption - fission ... comprises the nuclear chain reaction . Heat is continuously produced through this process , and is directly proportional to the number of fissions that occur . Before the next generation of neutron can lead to another fission , they must be * moderated * or reduced in energy . When born by fission , the neutrons have high kinetic energy as they are ejected from the nucleus , on the order of 2 - 3 MegaElectronVolts ( MeV ) . Those high energy neutrons have a very low probability of causing subsequent fissions ; essentially they just fly right past the target nuclei . To increase that fission probability , they have to be brought down in energy ( moderated ) to < 0.1 eV. Smartly , moderation occurs when neutrons interact with water . The neutron collides with the hydrogen atom in water , transferring some if its energy to the water molecule , bringing it down closer to where it can be absorbed . Simultaneously , the water heats up and across the entire core the bulk process leads to steam generation . Controlling power in the core is a balance of neutron content and moderation ; how many neutrons dictates how many fissions occur , and moderation impacts the likelihood of those fissions occurring . Adding and removing fuel must be done when the reactor is cold , essentially turned off . By turned off I mean the fission chain reaction stopped , therefore fission power will not increase for energy reason . Utilities that operate the plants swap out "" burnt "" fuel bundles that have depleted U-235 fissile content . They do not produce as much heat as fresh bundles because the number of fissile atoms reduces as the fuel is burned . Huge cranes lift and rearrange the fuel bundles according to a precise analysis of optimal positioning . Fuel bundles , AKA assemblies , are a bunch of fuel rods held together by spacers . Rods are long pins packed with fuel pellets where the heat is generated . Pretty simple , right ? ;)', 'In a reactor , neutrons are used to split atoms to release energy and heat . When you split atoms , you also get more neutrons out , which allow the nuclear reaction to continue on its own . The heat is used to boil water , either directly in the reactor , or somewhere else . The boiled water / steam is used to turn a turbine . Refuelling of nuclear plants is performed every 18 - 24 months . They shut down , cool down , disassemble the reactor pressure vessel , pull out the reactor internals , and shuffle the fuel . About 35 % of the fuel ( on average ) is replaced . Then the reactor is reassembled , pressure tested , and restarted . To start and stop the reactor , control rods are used . The control rods have material that absorbs neutrons . By taking them out , they absorb less neutrons , and allow the nuclear reaction to become self sustaining . By putting them in , the neutrons in the core get absorbed , until the reaction is no longer self sustaining and shuts down . The control rods are hooked up to a reactor protection system which looks for abnormal conditions in the plant , and if it sees them , shuts down the reactor within 3 seconds by releasing the rods so they can get pushed into the reactor . Once the reactor is online , power is controlled in most reactors by changing the amount of cooling to the core . For pressurized water reactors , by removing more steam , you cool the water down more before it goes in the reactor , which increase power and removing less steam means the water returning to the reactor is hotter , which reduces power . For boiling water reactors , we adjust how much cooling water we push through the reactor . Pushing more cooling water increases power , and less cooling water decreases power .']",0,real

122,122,"['In 2014 the IRS announced that it published guidance in Notice 2014-21. In that notice, the answer to the first question describes the general tax treatment of virtual currency: For federal tax purposes, virtual currency is treated as property. General tax principles applicable to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency. As it\'s property like any other, capital gains if and when you sell are taxed. As with any capital gains, you\'re taxed on the ""profit"" you made, that is the ""proceeds"" (how much you got when you sold) minus your ""basis"" (how much you paid to get the property that you sold). Until you sell, it\'s just an asset (like a house, or a share of stock, or a rare collectible card) that doesn\'t require any reporting. If your initial cryptocurrency acquisition was through mining, then this section of that Notice applies: Q-8: Does a taxpayer who “mines” virtual currency (for example, uses computer resources to validate Bitcoin transactions and maintain the public Bitcoin transaction ledger) realize gross income upon receipt of the virtual currency resulting from those activities? A-8: Yes, when a taxpayer successfully “mines” virtual currency, the fair market value of the virtual currency as of the date of receipt is includible in gross income. See Publication 525, Taxable and Nontaxable Income, for more information on taxable income. That is to say, when it was mined the market value of the amount generated should have been included in income (probably on either Line 21 Other Income, or on Schedule C if it\'s from your own business). At that point, the market value would also qualify as your basis. Though I doubt there\'d be a whole lot of enforcement action for not amending your 2011 return to include $0.75. (Technically if you find a dollar bill on the street it should be included in income, but usually the government cares about bigger fish than that.) It sounds like your basis is close enough to zero that it\'s not worth trying to calculate a more accurate value. Since your basis couldn\'t be less than zero, there\'s no way that using zero as your basis would cause you to pay less tax than you ought, so the government won\'t have any objections to it.  One thing to be careful of is to document that your holdings qualify for long-term capital gains treatment (held longer than a year) if applicable. Also, as you\'re trading in multiple cryptocurrencies, each transaction may count as a ""sale"" of one kind followed by a ""purchase"" of the other kind, much like if you traded your Apple stock for Google stock. It\'s possible that ""1031 like kind exchange"" rules apply, and in June 2016 the American Institute of CPAs sent a letter asking about it (among other things), but as far as I know there\'s been no official IRS guidance on the matter. There are also some related questions here; see ""Do altcoin trades count as like-kind exchanges?"" and ""Assuming 1031 Doesn\'t Apply To Cryptocurrency Trading"". But if in fact those exchange rules do not apply and it is just considered a sale followed by a purchase, then you would need to report each exchange as a sale with that asset\'s basis (probably $0 for the initial one), and proceeds of the fair market value at the time, and then that same value would be the basis of the new asset you\'re purchasing. Using a $0 basis is how I treat my bitcoin sales, though I haven\'t dealt with other cryptocurrencies. As long as all the USD income is being reported when you get USD, I find it unlikely you\'ll run into a lot of trouble, even if you technically were supposed to report the individual transactions when they happened. Though, I\'m not in charge of IRS enforcement, and I\'m not aware of any high-profile cases, so it\'s hard to know anything for sure.

123,123,"[""With a little bit of inflation ( i.e. prices going up ) , people are encouraged to spend what they 've got so their money does n't lose value . The GDP tends to grow nicely in these conditions . With a lot of inflation , people want to instantly invest in bonds or commodities that are very stable . The idea is they want to turn their money into a product that wo n't change in value . So when inflation stops rising , they can sell their bonds or commodities , and effectively be where they left off .

And now our national debt feels 10 times smaller . But getting there would almost certainly involve a huge recession along the way . And it would really tick off investors in US bonds , almost certainly forcing the interest rates on those to drastically climb .

It 's hard to have good communication about inflation with Ron Paul , because his idea of inflation is entirely different from everyone else 's idea of inflation . For example , lets say our country has 10 % more people in it , so we increase the money supply by 10 % .

129,129,"['The house that sells for $200,000 might rent for a range of monthly numbers. 3% would be $6000/yr or $500/mo. This is absurdly low, and favors renting, not buying. 9% is $1500/mo in which case buying the house to live in or rent out (as a landlord) is the better choice. At this level ""paying rent"" should be avoided.  I\'m simply explaining the author\'s view, not advocating it.  A quote from the article -  annual rent / purchase price = 3% means do not buy, prices are too   high annual rent / purchase price = 6% means borderline annual rent / purchase price = 9% means ok to buy, prices are   reasonable Edit to respond to Chuck\'s comment - Mortgage rates for qualified applicants are pretty tight from low to high, the 30 year is about 4.4% and the 15, 3.45%. Of course, a number of factors might mean paying more, but this is the average rate. And it changes over time. But the rent and purchase price in a given area will be different. Very different based on location. See what you\'d pay for 2000 sq feet in Manhattan vs a nice town in the Mid-West. One can imagine a \'heat\' map, when an area might show an $800 rent on a house selling for $40,000 as a ""4.16"" (The home price divided by annual rent) and another area as a ""20"", where the $200K house might rent for $1667/mo. It\'s not homogeneous through the US. As I said, I\'m not taking a position, just discussing how the author formulated his approach. The author makes some assertions that can be debatable, e.g. that low rates are a bad time to buy because they already pushed the price too high. In my opinion, the US has had the crash, but the rates are still low. Buying is a personal decision, and the own/rent ratios are only one tool to be added to a list of factors in making the decision.  Of course the article, as written, does the math based on the rates at time of publication (4%/30years). And the ratio of income to mortgage one can afford is tied to the current rate. The $60K couple, at 4%, can afford just over a $260K mortgage, but at 6%, $208K, and 8%, $170K. The struggle isn\'t with the payment, but the downpayment.   The analysis isn\'t too different for a purchase to invest. If the rent exceeds 1% of the home price, an investor should be able to turn a profit after expenses.']",0,real

Pharmacies have to call the doctor to have them change it to something that is covered . ( Smart doctors write something generic like "" inhaler "" so the pharmacy is able to use what is covered without doing this ) . 2 ) Insufficient information . Most people are not proactive enough to give pharmacies updated information so they just toss them a prescription and they try to process it , and run into the insurance wall which breaks their work flow as they need to go back to you to gather information ( all because you did not give the sufficient information ) . This can also lead to your prescription being moved further back in the work flow queue than it is supposed to because it is an "" issue "" since its better to delay one persons prescription then to have that one person hold up everyone else . 3 ) Changed insurance plans or part of an insurance company that has sub plans or the start of a new year ( new formulary ) .

There are players that fight and players that do n\'t , and it \'s not really a machismo / honor thing that you MUST fight . No one thinks less of you for not being a fighter . If you jump someone who is NOT looking for a fight you are usually going to get tossed from the game and probably suspended for a few games to boot . It \'s not OK to blind - side someone who is not likewise spoiling for a fight and generally speaking that is frowned upon . So the minor penalties and general lack of punishment is only in the case of two people who have collaboratively decided to go at it , which is true for almost every fight you see .

The disclosure continued throughout 2013, and a small portion of the estimated full cache of documents was later published by other media outlets worldwide, most notably The New York Times (United States), the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Der Spiegel (Germany), O Globo (Brazil), Le Monde (France), L\'espresso (Italy), NRC Handelsblad (the Netherlands), Dagbladet (Norway), El País (Spain), and Sveriges Television (Sweden).\nThese media reports have shed light on the implications of several secret treaties signed by members of the UKUSA community in their efforts to implement global surveillance. For example, Der Spiegel revealed how the German Federal Intelligence Service (German: Bundesnachrichtendienst; BND) transfers ""massive amounts of intercepted data to the NSA"", while Swedish Television revealed the National Defence Radio Establishment (FRA) provided the NSA with data from its cable collection, under a secret treaty signed in 1954 for bilateral cooperation on surveillance. Other security and intelligence agencies involved in the practice of global surveillance include those in Australia (ASD), Britain (GCHQ), Canada (CSE), Denmark (PET), France (DGSE), Germany (BND), Italy (AISE), the Netherlands (AIVD), Norway (NIS), Spain (CNI), Switzerland (NDB), Singapore (SID) as well as Israel (ISNU), which receives raw, unfiltered data of U.S. citizens that is shared by the NSA.[10][11][12][13][14][15]\nOn June 14, 2013, United States prosecutors charged Edward Snowden with espionage and theft of government property. In late July 2013, he was granted a one-year temporary asylum by the Russian government,[16] contributing to a deterioration of Russia–United States relations.[17][18] Towards the end of October 2013, the British Prime Minister David Cameron warned The Guardian not to publish any more leaks, or it will receive a DA-Notice.[19] In November 2013, a criminal investigation of the disclosure was being undertaken by Britain\'s Metropolitan Police Service.[20] In December 2013, The Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger said: ""We have published I think 26 documents so far out of the 58,000 we\'ve seen.""[21]\nThe extent to which the media reports have responsibly informed the public is disputed. In January 2014, Obama said that ""the sensational way in which these disclosures have come out has often shed more heat than light""[22] and critics such as Sean Wilentz have noted that many of the Snowden documents released do not concern domestic surveillance.[23] The US & British Defense establishment weigh the strategic harm in the period following the disclosures more heavily than their civic public benefit. In its first assessment of these disclosures, the Pentagon concluded that Snowden committed the biggest ""theft"" of U.S. secrets in the history of the United States.[24] Sir David Omand, a former director of GCHQ, described Snowden\'s disclosure as the ""most catastrophic loss to British intelligence ever"".[25]']",0,real

These 200 people are sharing 5 votes , so each person only gets .025 of a vote . Obviously , .03 is more than .025 , so people in the smaller states have a bigger electoral vote .

In fact , you 've got so many states who do n't like the system , if you combined all of them together , you 'd have more than 217 electoral college votes .

Little states wanted one vote per state , big states wanted to vote by population . As a compromise , Congress has two houses , the Senate , where each state has the same number of votes , and the House of Representatives , where each state gets vote in proportion to its population . In this way , the interests of big states and little states were balanced . The Electoral College is a reflection of this . Each state starts with 2 votes , then gains extra votes depending on population . So a state like Wyoming gets 3 votes , instead of only one , and gets a little more say in the election . The Electoral College served other purposes in the past , but most of them have become obsolete . It has only clearly disagreed with the popular vote once ( Harrison vs. Cleveland , 1888 ) . Three other times ( Adams vs. Jackson 1824 , Hayes vs. Tilden , 1876 , Bush vs. Gore , 2000 ) the loser of the popular vote eventually became president under extenuating circumstances .

The entire idea behind tor is that by bouncing your information through different relay points , each of which is secured and the data transfers between them are encrypted , thus making your communications much harder to trace back to you . If I turn on my computer and use a regular browser , lets say Firefox , my computer requests that a specific bit of information from , lets say , reddit . My request is sent from my computer , to my ISP 's servers , to the servers of the website and then takes the little bit of information , lets say a specific webpage , and then does that same process in reverse . Taking the information from the servers of the website to the ISP 's servers and then back to my computer . Tor complicates this process by , rather then doing a straight line of data from computer to ISP to site , first encrypting all the communication and then secondly bouncing that signal / request for data around before submitting the request for information . This has the effect of making you appear like your in another place and posses a different IP address then you actually do . Simply put , a Tor node is one of the small parts of the jump that obfuscates your physical location and IP address by bouncing your information . An exit node is a tor node that serves as the ' exit ' point from the tor network and sends the actual request for information from the site . Hopefully that clears this up , if you have anymore questions just ask . :)"", 'Tor is an encryption system that bounces your data between dozens of computers around the world , each computer unravelling one layer of encryption that tells it who to send it to next , to make it tough to trace . Each one of those computers is a node , and the one at the end of the chain - where your data hits the rest of the internet - is an exit node .', ""TOR is a routing system and stands for ' The Onion Router ' because it works in layers , just like an ogre or an onion . A TOR node is a node that participates in a TOR network , i.e. a server somewhere on the planet . The exit node is just the last node in a given configuration , i.e. the node just before the server you want to reach . TOR is used to hide the identity of the user . TOR works like this : you take your message and encrypt it with multiple encryption algorithms - one for every TOR node you want to route through . Thus layers . You do it in the following order : the most outer layer is encrypted so the the very first TOR node and only the very first TOR node can decipher it . The second outer layer is encrypted so the the second TOR route can decipher it and so on , and the last layer is encrypted so that the exit node can decipher it . This means that if you send your message to the first node he gets rid of the most outer layer . The message is still scrambled and unreadable because there are still as many encryption layers as there are TOR routes left . Now , provided you use end - to - end encryption on top of using TOR this system becomes pretty good at hiding your identity because for every single node in the configuration the node only knows where any given message came from and where it has to go . It does n't know if it 's the first one that got the message or the last one and it does n't know what 's written in it . So , unless every single TOR node in a configuration is corrupted you can be sure that your identity is hidden .""]",0,real

You say okay , and you increase your widget price to $ 13 . So what has happened ? Well , nothing to you . You are still making your dollar per widget , and your employee is making the minimum wage . Enter Company # 2 that makes wodgets . Wodgets are the item your employee requires to survive , and he must have one each hour . The wodgets are the same price as your widgets , and the employee that makes them used to pay their employee $ 10 a hour , but they got affected by the minimum wage increase as well , so they had to increase their prices also , and they also make a dollar a item , so the wodget is now $ 13 too . So to maintain their profits , they raised the price as well . In summary , your employee is making 2 dollars more per hour , but because the wage increase affects all companies across the board , everyone has to adjust , meaning if they want to maintain their profits and similar , they either need to increase their prices or be willing to take a profit cut . That sounds all fine and good , but then you get into the real world where you have shareholders and complex stuff like that , people who EXPECT your company to adjust but continue to deliver the results it did before . Either way , your employee is still a dollar short like they were previously and somehow have to come up with that . In the end , people make more money , but in order to maintain the profits and make the company still economically viable , they either have to get more productivity out of less people , or they have to increase the price of the product to maintain that profit line . tl;dr : if you increase someones wage , the work they are doing must produce the same profit as well or the company can not sustain itself , so costs go up and most if not all of this increase is passed to the consumer , who , although they have more wage money coming in , must now take that increase and use it to cover the increased cost of what they are buying . -- It is obviously too complex to really explain , and my simplistic example is n't even remotely close to reality , obviously . You could use less employees , but then more people are unemployed , collecting unemployment , which is funded by .... employees and employers , and if the funds get lower then they might have to pay in more to cover those who are not employed . Pretty hard to put into this format without being simplistic , but I tried ."", ""While you might assume that raising the minimum wage is great , ' Hey , more money for everyone at the bottom ' , the reality is more complicated . Raising the minimum wage will often cause lower overall employment , companies will begin to substitute labor for other goods . For example , say you run a fast food joint , that employs 10 people to cook , clean , and serve all the food . They earn minimum wage , and suddenly that cost goes up . As an owner , you look at the cost and realize that you could now save money by only employing 8 people , and instead buying an automatic french fry making machine . So while the 8 people left make more money , two are out of a job because its no longer cost effective to employ them . Another example , say you run a business and minimum wage is $ 7 . You 've figured out that if you hire one more person , you can earn $ 9 more per hour . So you hire the person , earn 9 , pay 7 , and are happy . But now the minimum wage gets raised to $ 10 , you realize that you 'll need to fire that employee , because they no longer make what they cost . It 's often said that the minimum wage takes the bottom rung out of the employment ladder . It can make it particularly hard for young and inexperienced people to find work and get valuable experience . A company might want to hire a teenager at $ 5 / hr to do some small task , and the teenager would benefit from the experience , but they are not allowed to ."", ""That 's because people disagree on what the answer is .""]",0,real

If you don\'t have insurance, there is a large chance that you will have no cost in any given month, and a small chance that you will have a large cost. Like my home-owners insurance costs me about $50 per month. If I didn\'t have insurance and my house burned down, I would be out something like $100,000. What\'s the chance that my house will burn down this month? Very small. But I\'d rather pay $50 and not have to worry about it. On the other hand, I just bought a filing cabinet for $160 and the store offered me an ""extended warranty"" for something like $20 a year. What\'s the probability that some accident will happen that damages my filing cabinet? Pretty small. Even if it did, I think I could handle shelling out $160. I can imagine my stomach in knots and lying awake at nights worrying about the possibility of losing $100,000 or finding myself homeless. I can\'t imagine lying awake at nights worrying about losing $160 or being force to stuff my files under the bed. I\'ll take my chances.

Cash value life insurance makes sense if: If you you aren\'t maxing out your retirement accounts, just stick with term insurance, and save as much as you can for retirement. Otherwise, if you have at least 5 or 10k extra after you\'ve funded retirement (for at least 7 years),  one financial strategy is to buy a whole life policy from one of the big three mutual insurance firms.  You buy a low face value policy, for example, say 50k face value; the goal is to build cash value in the policy. Overload the policy by buying additional paid up insurance in the first 7 years of the policy, using a paid-up addition rider of the policy. This policy will then grow its cash value at around 2% to 4% over the life of the policy....similar perhaps to the part of your portfolio that would would be in muni bonds; basically you are beating inflation by a small margin. Further, as you dump money into the policy, the death benefit grows. After 7 or 8 years, the cash value of the policy should equal the money you\'ve put into it, and your death benefit will have grown substantially maybe somewhere around $250k in this example. You can access the cash value by taking a policy loan; you should only do this when it makes sense financially or in an emergency; but the important thing to realize is that your cash is there, if you need it.  So now you have insurance, you have your cash reserves. Why should you do this?  You save up your cash and have access to it, and you get the insurance for ""free"" while still getting a small return on your investment.

This allowed recordings to have different information for your left ear and right ear . This adds depth to the sound because now your brain can process the difference of the same sound in both ears to determine distances . It is a fuller experience .', 'Each ear by itself can only hear how loud a sound is . However , both of your ears combined with your brain can tell the direction a sound comes from because one ear is often closer to the sound than the other ear , so that ear hears the sound first .

With mono sound , there is only one channel of audio , so no matter how many speakers you have , they all play the same sound at the same volume . If you have one speaker , the sound always sounds like it comes from that speaker . If you have more speakers , the sound always sounds like it comes from a fixed spot in between the speakers . This is unusual in the real world , because imagine listening to a band where every instrument and the singer \'s voice are all "" placed "" in the exact same position making their sounds .

The biggest difficulty to overcome in buying a car is the concept of the monthly payment.

The 18 month term is not normal for a lease, typically you'll see 24 or 36 months.

You're tempted to spend another $5400 (assuming no down-payment or other surprise fees) to drive a car for 18 months. That doesn't sound any wiser than $5,000 for an unreliable used car that gave you more problems than you bargained for. Presumably you got some percentage of that money back from the insurance company when the car was totaled, but even if not, the real lesson should be finding a car that you can afford up-front, but also one that you can still use when the loan is paid off (like your education--that investment will keep giving even when the loans are a distant memory). My advice would be to look for a car that has about 30k miles on it and pay for it as quickly as possible, then drive it at least for 70-120k more miles before replacing it. You may wish for a newer car, especially in 3 or 4 more years when it starts to show its age, but you'll also thank yourself when you can buy a newer better car with cash and break out of the monthly payment game that dealers try to push on you.

Along these lines I\'d also examine your goals in life.  If your desire is to be a wealthy person, then why would you borrow money to buy a car?  Seek to imitate rich people to become rich.

English itself is typically said to have three stages , Early English , Middle English , and Modern English . Geoffrey Chaucer , a poet in the 14th and 15th centuries , wrote his English in a manner we would scarcely be able to discern in modern day English . This is important because Chaucer \'s English is still categorized as modern English . This passage from his Canterbury Tales shows just how different the language has come in a few hundred years . Whan that Aprill , with his shoures soote The droghte of March hath perced to the roote It \'s important to factor culture into this discussion , since culture is the main reason why language evolves . Words like \' troll \' , \' booty \' , and \' YOLO \' , have all derived from modern day pop culture . In the past , language changed almost exclusively due to literature . It \'s said Shakespeare alone contributed 1700 unique words to the English language . From there , certain factors such as literacy , socio - economic status , and even certain health issues all contribute to language , and as consequence affect accents . Over time , as populations migrate and collect in dense areas , these factors blend and transform into new accents . The reason why you see a stark difference between the south US and northern US is due to who primarily settled there . In the south you had rich landowners , who , to separate themselves from the rest of the population , brought their "" proper "" language with them from Europe . This , mixed with the many African dialects that came over in early America , has evolved into what we hear today . Merchant class citizens typically settled in the north . Later Scandinavian influence ( especially in the midwest ) has evolved into what we hear today . As for changing accents ... You actually can and will develop a new accent over time if you find yourself among a population who has a completely different accent to you . I \'m a Minnesotan .

When I visit family from as close as Indiana I notice my accent starts to change ever so slightly to have more of that drawl .

260,260,"['There \'s a few similar answers here , but a lot of history missing . I \'ll summarize and let others elaborate . Our story begines some time ago when the internet was still relatively new ... In Japan , nerds are ostracised socially . They are called "" otaku "" and they get a lot of very negative media attention . If someone is outed as an otaku , people may look down on them , even disown them as friends or refuse to hire them . But there are also a very very large amount of nerds in Japan . This , combined with the facts that Japan as a whole is a very tech savvy country , but also very private , gave rise to a very important message board called 2channel . It was important because it pioneered the idea that you should be able to post to a message board anonymously . This way , you could discuss your nerdy hobbies openly with like - minded individuals and not have it link back to your real identity . Your hobbies were private from your real life , and vice versa . 2channel was very popular , but left out some important features . A different website was made that was like 2channel except you could post images instead of just text . It was called 2chan ( or "" futaba channel "" ) . Meanwhile in America , the internet was rapidly growing . American nerds were creating "" underground communities "" on the internet that focused heavily on not only discussion of hobbies and interests , but content creation and the rapid spreading of jokes and other anecdotes . One of these ( probably the biggest in its time ) was called Something Awful , or SA for short . SA was also a pioneer in some of its fields , by forcing users to spend $ 10 for an account in order to post but also would permanently ban you for the slightest rulebreaking ( this helped stop spam and prevent unwanted mediocre posts ) . SA also really pushed the envelope in controversial topics , by creating dark humor and shock value . However , you were still required to register in order to post , which meant that a paper - trail was always left that could possibly lead back to you . A member of this community named Moot learned of 2chan over in japan and felt the philosophy of anonymous posting could do well in communities like SA . He replicated the 2chan software and called it 4chan . 4chan quickly developed a cult following and became the source of many of the classic memes and internet culture we see today , for better or worse . The core userbase came from SA , but it grew very very rapidly . The community of 4chan flew the banner of anonymity proudly . They referred to users of 4chan as "" anonymous "" and branded anonymous as a single entity , a hivemind , which they personified as a character wearing a suit with a "" no picture available "" face as you might see when no avatar is provided on a conventional forum . This character ( as a result of [ other memes ] ( URL_0 ) and [ in - jokes ] ( URL_1 ) ( nsfw ) of the website ) would sometimes be seen wearing the guy fawkes mask instead of his typical green face . 4chan had one major flaw : There was no social aspect . The point was to be and remain anonymous , so people could never really connect , socialize or develop friendships in a meaningful way ( except for at 4chan panels at anime conventions , which were only visited by niche members of the website ) . Those that tried were ostracised and belittled by the website as a whole for going against what it stood for , even though it was something everyone really wanted ( since people are inherently social creatures and we like being friends with like - minded people ) . [ Note , this is my opinion on the matter but I think it \'s one many would agree with ] This reached a kind of critical mass until anon decided to create a kind of large global 4chan meetup under the guise of protesting the Church of Scientology , kind of a way to kill two birds with one stone . There were some interesting successes and failures as a result of this social experiment , and several factions formed as a result . Some loved meeting other Anons . Some thought it went against everything the website stood for . Some people really got involved in the cause of protesting Scientology . Some thought meeting anons was cool , but protesting scientology was childish . Some forgot about the whole thing and moved on . All of these people called themselves "" anonymous "" , but they all started going down very different paths . The Scientology protest movement grew legs of its own and eventually separated itself from their ties to 4chan . This same group and other groups inspired by this activist movement is what media commonly refers to when they say "" anonymous "" , and their roots are why they share the monkier and guy - fawkes imagery with 4chan . However , 4chan \'s "" anonymous "" and the activist "" anonymous "" group , while sharing roots and oftentimes members , are often mistaken as the same group when they should be referred to as separate . Realistically though , "" anonymous "" is more of an idea than anything . It was founded by nerds on imageboards , but it has really spread as a concept that says "" you have the right to speak your mind anonymously without it affecting your real identity "" . * * edit * * : comical tl;dr "" people on the internet wanted to talk about anime girl butts without their friends and family calling them losers so they made websites for that and it caught on ""', 'Anonymous was originally the name given to the users of 4chan .

This is the gift limit, due to rise to $14,000 in 2013.  If your goal is strictly to fund college, and this limit isn't an issue for you, the one account may be fine unless both kids are in school at the same time. In that case, you're going to need to change beneficiaries every year to assign withdrawals properly.  But, as you mention, there's gift money that your considering depositing to the account. In this case, there's really a legal issue. The normal 529 allows changes in beneficiary, and gifts to your child need to be held for that child in an irrevocable arrangement such as a UTMA account. There is a 529 flavor that provides for no change of beneficiary, a UTMA 529. Clearly, in that case, you need separate accounts.  In conclusion, I think the single account creates more issues than it potentially solves. If the true gift money from others is minimal, maybe you should just keep it in a regular account. Edit - on further reflection, I strongly suggest you keep the relatives' gifts in a separate account, and when the kids are old enough to have legitimate earned income, use this money to open and deposit to Roth IRAs. They can deposit the lesser of their earned income or $5000 in 2012, $5500 in 2013.

Basically think of Social Security like a business : You have the Social Security tax , which is revenue . Then there are people being paid social security , which is an expense . Since Social Security \'s conception , there has always been a surplus ( where the government takes in more taxes than pays out benefits ) . This surplus goes to an account called "" Social Security Surplus "" . ~~The money in the Surplus Account is used to pay down the national debt.~~ The problem that politicians refer to , however , is that with the entirety of the Baby Boomers ( the largest segment of the U.S. Population ) about to retire in the next decade , for the first time in U.S. history there is going to be a Social Security deficit . This is fine for the first year , but when people retire between 55 and 65 generally , we can reasonably expect that they will live another 20 - 30 years assuming they are healthy in most regards .

Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, LSTM has feedback connections. Such a recurrent neural network (RNN) can process not only single data points (such as images), but also entire sequences of data (such as speech or video). For example, LSTM is applicable to tasks such as unsegmented, connected handwriting recognition, speech recognition, machine translation, robot control, video games,[10] and healthcare.[11]\nThe name of LSTM refers to the analogy that a standard RNN has both ""long-term memory"" and ""short-term memory"". The connection weights and biases in the network change once per episode of training, analogous to how physiological changes in synaptic strengths store long-term memories; the activation patterns in the network change once per time-step, analogous to how the moment-to-moment change in electric firing patterns in the brain store short-term memories.[12] The LSTM architecture aims to provide a short-term memory for RNN that can last thousands of timesteps, thus ""long short-term memory"".\nA common LSTM unit is composed of a cell, an input gate, an output gate[13] and a forget gate.[14] The cell remembers values over arbitrary time intervals and the three gates regulate the flow of information into and out of the cell.\nLSTM networks are well-suited to classifying, processing and making predictions based on time series data, since there can be lags of unknown duration between important events in a time series. LSTMs were developed to deal with the vanishing gradient problem[15] that can be encountered when training traditional RNNs. Relative insensitivity to gap length is an advantage of LSTM over RNNs, hidden Markov models and other sequence learning methods in numerous applications.[citation needed]']",0,real

290,290,"[""To put it super simply ; seizures are when neurons in your brain get hyperexcited and start firing off ( and often different pathways nearby that should n't be activated get excited too ) . Alcohol is a central nervous system depressant . When you chronically drink alcohol , it increases the activation / release of GABA , which is an inhibitory neurotransmitter . Again , in simple terms this just depresses the function of pathways and makes it harder for neurons to fire off . After a while , your body gets used to operating under such high levels of inhibition from all the GABA released from drinking alcohol . This manifests in the form of neurons becoming super - sensitive to any signal that 's going to excite them . So on the one hand you have them being depressed by GABA , and on the other you have them being hypersensitive to whatever activates them . This balances out to basically normal function . When you finally stop drinking , suddenly you 're no longer getting that excessive GABA release and so they 're not being inhibited / depressed any.ore . * But * , the neurons are still hypersensitive to activation signals . So they 're hyperexcitable ; stopping alcohol takes the brakes off them and they get activated super easily and fire off leading to the seizures seen early in severe alcohol withdrawal ( delirium tremens ) until those neurons get used to not being inhibited and return to normal levels of excitability . Again , this is kinda simplified . GABA depresses function by majorly inhibiting neurotransmitters that * excite * neurons and promote signalling ( stuff like noradrenaline , glutamate , and dopamine ) . It also blocks the NMDA receptor which is responsible for mediating the excitatory effects of glutamate . In response , your body increases the amount of NMDA receptors a neuron expresses , so it 's more sensitive to glutamate and more likely to get excited ( to combat the depressive GABA effects and get back to some degree of normal function while the person is still drinking ) . This is that hyperexcitable state I was talking about . Then the person stops drinking and suddenly you have a buttload of excitatory noradrenaline / glutamate release ( because they 're no longer inhibited by GABA ) * and * you have neurons which are absolutely covered in receptors to bind and get activated by all that noradrenaline / glutamate .

293,293,"[""Dear Patient,      Thank you very much for your question. According to American heart association, normal healthy heart rate is 60-100 beats per minute when you are relaxed and not engaged in a physical activity. If your heart rate is 100 bpm or above while you are resting and relaxed it is called as tachycardia. However, If you engage in any physical activity your heart rate can race up. That is normal.  Subtracting your age from 220 you can find out your maximum heart rate. For instance, If you are 50 years old, your maximum heart rate is 220-50= 170 bpm. Anyway in your condition, I would recommend that you consult your family doctor for a physical examination and proper consultation. I am sure your family doctor will direct you to a  normal ECG test and stress ECG or exercise ECG test to rule out some pathologies appearing during physical activities. Also he or she may direct you to a holter monitor test if necessary to rule out some arrhythmias.  Conditions like atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter can cause very high pulse rate like yours and sometimes for that cause is hyperthyroidism. Therefore, you might need to check your thyroid function too.               Concerning your blood in stool, I think it might be as a result of gastrointestinal pathology and I hardly believe it is  related to your high pulse rate.Also I want to ask you the color of blood you noticed on your stool. Red color fresh blood on stool can be due to hemorrhoids or due to hard stool passage  while black stool can be as a result of hemorrhage due to ulcer disease, ulcerative colitis etc.  In order to diagnose these conditions, again you have to do a stool test and explain all other symptoms you have. You may need to undergo an endoscopy if your physician wants to rule out above mentioned diseases.  I think your blood in stool may be related to a gastrointestinal pathology.Therefore, I will highly recommend that you consult your family doctor for proper consultation,diagnosis and treatment.  I hope that I've answered your question. If you have any further questions,please let me know.Good luck!Dr. Dinesh Nuwan Weerasinghe. MD""]",0,real

So if we played 500 more games , instead of expecting to win half and half , I might have a slight advantage because I \'m aware of your pattern . Now let \'s pretend you know how observant I am , and pick up on my advantage of pattern recognition . To eliminate that advantage , you could look at your watch every time before we threw , and use the second hand to determine whether you threw rock paper or scissors . If the second hand was 0 to 20 seconds , you throw rock , 20 to 40 paper , and 40 to 60 scissors . Since the watch is utterly clueless as to the game you are playing , your throws would be entirely * random , * and therefore would eliminate any advantage I would have obtained previously through observation . This is a very simple example of how game theory could be applied . edit : typo', 'What it is : Game Theory is the mathematics of solving games . Games are considered any situation in which a series of decisions leads to different outcomes ( some better than others ) and our job is to formulate a strategy to make these decisions in order to reach optimal outcomes . Here is a simple example : You have this position in Tic - Tac - Toe : X | O | X ---------- O | _ | O ---------- X | O | _ ---------- You have a decision to make , you can either place it in the center or lower right corner . One will lead you to a victory while the other leads to a setup for your opponents victory . A basic strategy becomes clear : Choose the move that will guarantee you three - in - a - row . Often game strategies are n\'t this clear . For example , how would we get to this position ? We can simulate all possible outcomes by looking at every possible sequence of moves from the beginning of the game . But while this would work for a game like Tic - Tac - Toe where we do n\'t have too many possibilities how would we make this work for Chess where there are trillions of possibilities . The simple answer is we do n\'t look at possibilities . Game Theory takes on the assumption that our opponent will be a rational player who is almost as if not just as good as us . We look into moves that an opponent would actually put because they have are somewhat intelligent . This narrows down possibilities and helps us fine tune our strategy for these smart competitors . When Game Theorists start to look at different games they notice some patterns between games . These patterns that they have discovered have developed into theory and this theory can be directly applied to real life applications . These patterns have strategies on how to treat that general type of game . Applications : We can of course apply our theory to any traditional game ( chess , checkers , go , etc .. ) but that s boring . A game can be considered any situation where you have to make decisions in order to optimize your outcome . So , games are really anywhere : - The stock market . Your decisions are whether you buy or sell a particular stock and your outcome is the success or failure of a stock after a fixed amount of time . In here our opponent is the market itself . - Evolution . Evolution is a game . The decisions are which animals mate and the outcomes are which mates bring the fittest offspring . Our opponent is nature which selectively chooses a few to live . - etc . Because of this it has been suggested a better name for the subject would be "" Decision Theory "" . Real Game Theory is defined as the study of mathematical models of * * conflict * * and * * cooperation * * between * * intelligent * * and * * rational * * decision makers . Game theory is also intertwined closely with computer science . Programmers need to code computers to simulate decisions and evaluate their respective outcomes . The necessity for computers comes from the sheer immensity of the number of possible simulations . Edit : Grammar', ""It is the mathematically study of adversarial decision making . You have some situation , where participants have competing goals and make decisions based on reaching their goals and preventing others from reaching theirs .

Google \'s searching procedure employs more powerful models for attempting to pinpoint the actual intent of a user \'s search . These models are based on probability and very quantifiable and ultimately result in the deriving of more relevant results in a Google search for a tricky query than those you might get from Bing .

In some fields, most notably in the context of artificial neural networks, the term ""sigmoid function"" is used as an alias for the logistic function.\nSpecial cases of the sigmoid function include the Gompertz curve (used in modeling systems that saturate at large values of x) and the ogee curve (used in the spillway of some dams). Sigmoid functions have domain of all real numbers, with return (response) value commonly monotonically increasing but could be decreasing. Sigmoid functions most often show a return value (y axis) in the range 0 to 1. Another commonly used range is from −1 to 1.\nA wide variety of sigmoid functions including the logistic and hyperbolic tangent functions have been used as the activation function of artificial neurons. Sigmoid curves are also common in statistics as cumulative distribution functions (which go from 0 to 1), such as the integrals of the logistic density, the normal density, and Student\'s t probability density functions. The logistic sigmoid function is invertible, and its inverse is the logit function.']",0,real

359,359,"['The Finance Buff discusses why the Roth 401k is often disadvantaged compared to a Traditional 401k in the article The Case Against the Roth 401k, including the following reasons (paraphrased): Contributions to the 401k come from the ""top"" of your highest tax bracket rate but withdrawals fill in from the ""bottom"".  For example, suppose you are in the 28% tax bracket.  Every marginal dollar you contribute to the Traditional 401k reduces your tax burden by .28 cents.  However, when withdrawing, the first $10,150 of income is tax-free (from standard deduction and exemption, 2014 numbers; $20,300 for married couples, joint filing).  The next dollars are at the 10% tax bracket, and so on.  This is an advantage for the Traditional 401k only if you earn less when withdrawing than you did when contributing, a reasonable assumption. Avoid High State Income Tax. There are many states that have low or no state income tax.  If you live in a state with a high income tax, paying tax now through the Roth 401k reduces the benefit of moving to a state with a lower income tax rate. Avoid triggering credit phaseouts. Many tax credits (e.g. student loan interest, child tax credit, Hope credit, Roth IRA eligibility, etc.) begin phasing out as your income increases.  Contributing to the Traditional 401k can help you realize more of those credits when you starting running up against those limits. As described in the article, if these items don\'t apply, contributing to the Roth 401k can be a valuable component of tax diversification.']",0,real

This amplifies and shockwave and pushes it outward , away from the central point of detonation with more force . Fragmentation damage is an effect in both cases . In impact detonation the frag is reflected upward and out from the ground ( since it impacted the ground first ) and is slowed somewhat by the contact with the ground . This is the desired effect for harder targets . In an air burst the frag pattern is directed toward the ground with more force ( initially ) and then pushed outward by the outward directed shockwave . This is more desired for softer targets ( vehicles , radars , personnel ) . Alternatively in a delay burst , the weapon impacts first and then a set time delay is executed prior to fuse actuation . This allows the velocity of the weapon to penetrate harder targets so that it may detonate inside the target . This is useful for concrete , buildings ( sometimes depending on construction ) , armored targets ( depending on the weapon ) , tunnels or bunkers . There are caveats to each of these situations .', 'With a ground burst , a lot of the explosion energy is used up by the ground / material very close to the explosion center . An air burst can cause damage over a larger area , but causes less destruction at the explosion site than a ground burst . It becomes a question of strategy . Does the attacker desire to damage an entire city or level a single block ?', 'In WWI the combatants lobbed enormous volumes of artillery shells at each other , to not much effect ( on a per - shell basis , at least ): it \'s estimated that over a hundred shells were fired for each combat fatality during the war . The ineffectiveness was because the shells were mostly impact - fused , meaning there \'s a little gadget in the nose of the shell that is deformed on impact , setting off the explosive charge in the shell . This detonation , while quite fast , still took a little bit of time , during which the shell would usually bury itself into the earth . When it finally exploded , the surrounding dirt absorbed most of the force and shrapnel . Artillerists experimented during the war with timed fuses instead of impact fuses , set before the shell was fired . The idea was to calculate how long the shell would take in its path through the air , and set the fuse to burst the shell while it was still a few meters in the air . When it worked , this was extremely effective and greatly multiplied the destructive power of the shell . The problem was that it was very difficult to get right and rarely worked , resulting in the shells usually exploding high or in the ground anyway . In WWII , the British invented a device called the cavity magnetron , capable of generating high - energy radar waves . The secret of the technology was given to scientists in the United States , who embarked on a project of miniaturization and mass - production . The end result was a device that cost $ 18 and could be screwed into the nose of an artillery shell and used to trigger the detonation . This device ( called the "" VT fuse "" misleadingly ) could be set for a variety of ranges . The original purpose of the VT fuse was for anti - aircraft work ; hitting a moving target directly with a shell was essentially impossible , while detonating nearby required precise estimation of altitude and proper setting of a timed fuse . With a VT fuse , it was only necessary for the shell to come with 60 feet or so of the plane and it would detonate . But it also occurred to the developers that it could be used to air - burst shells , with the radar reflection from the ground detonating the shells at extremely precise preset altitudes , causing massive destruction to whatever / whoever was underneath . While the VT - fused shells were used by naval vessels from 1943 onwards , they did n\'t appear on the battlefield until their first use in late 1944 during the Battle of the Bulge ( and * very * handy they were then , an under - appreciated reason for eventual American success in the battle ) . The navy got them earlier because of security concerns - the US did n\'t want the Germans or Japanese to get their hands on a fuse that had failed to fire , but over water this would have been virtually impossible . By late 1944 it was clear that Germany was finished , so even if they had acquired one of these fuses it would have taken too long for them to reverse - engineer it and put it into production . Bonus factito : the cheap miniaturized cavity magnetrons eventually made an appearance in consumer goods - inside the microwave ovens we all have now .']",0,real

405,405,"['Ah , my time to shine . :) I used to be an airline pilot . What you experienced is what \'s know as "" clear air turbulence "" or CAT , and is an annoying sort of turbulence . Normally , the pilots are able to predict where the ( non - cat)-turbulence is , by simple using the weather radar in the nose of the aircraft to scan for water droplets ahed . Water droplets are good indicators of turbulence since "" normal "" turbulence is experienced inside ( or near ) certain forms of cumulus clouds . Cumulus clouds are the onces that look the cauliflower . They are created by air warming near the surface of the earth , which then breaks free and rises through the comparatively cooler air that surrounds it . When it does so , it gradually cools ( until it has the same temperature as the surrounding air ) at which point it will no longer rise . Somewhere in this process , it is more than likely that the air will become saturated with moisture ( the relative humidity will hit 100 % due to cooling ) and water droplets will form and fall as rain . Anyhow : That was NOT what you experienced , since this form of turbulence can easily be avoided , and can be VERY dangerous / severe . What you experienced was CAT , which sucks because there is no way ( nearly ) of predicting where it occurs . It normally occurs in one of two ways : either at the boundaries of a jetstream ( high - altitude FAST bands of wind streaming around due to coriolis forces ... ) or as a consequence of mountain waves . The jet - stream - induced type is generally fairly mild , and ca n\'t be precisely predicted , but when one aircraft encounters it , the location and altitude is reported so other aircraft can circumvent it . The mountain - induced types are often more severe , but can be somewhat predicted . They happen when wind blows fairly strongly over a mountain range which starts oscillations in the wind pattern which can continue for several 100 miles past the mountain chain . Experience tell you that on a day with winds of so and so speeds from just that direction , there is a good risk of CAT there and there .

410,410,"[""So the main reason people may believe this actually comes from some fairly robust reasoning to do with Black Holes . I 'll go step by step . The entropy of a bunch of stuff is pretty easy to understand . Roughly , it 's the number of ways the stuff could be arranged microscopically , that give rise to the same properties of the stuff macroscopically . It 's useful for describing things like gases , where a microscopic state is one set of positions of the molecules that make up the gas , and the macroscopic state is the temperature , pressure and volume of the gas . You can also think of the entropy as telling you how much information you 'd have to give to specify a particular microscopic arrangement , and so entropy is essentially the information content of the system . So , What happens if I throw my gas in a Black Hole ? In particular , what happens to the entropy ? The second law of thermodynamics says that entropy increases , but if I throw stuff into a Black Hole , and the gas disappears , then no more gas means no more entropy . In order to keep the second law of thermodynamics alive , you 've got to say that a Black Hole has entropy . Since we asked that the Black Hole help us obey the second law of thermodynamics , we should also ask that it obey something like the first law of thermodynamics . Really it 's a little more complicated and rigorous but the upshot is that we find that the entropy is related to the area of the Black Hole 's horizon , S ~ A. So what we should do then is say that the amount of information inside the Black Hole , can be found by measuring its surface area . In other words , everything that 's happening inside the Black Hole all of that data , has to be contained on the horizon of the hole . We have a holographic statement , that the physics inside the Black Hole should be described by some physics on the event horizon . It 's then a short jump to say that if it 's true for a Black Hole , objects which have the maximum possible entropy , because they 've got the maximum amount of stuff in them , then it should be true for everything else too . That given a region of space , we should be able to draw a big shape around it , and figure out everything about the inside of the shape just by examining the boundary . Theoretical physicists have pursued this much further and found concrete examples of something known as the AdS / CFT correspondence , which is a theory exactly of this type . With gravity in the volume , and a special quantum field theory describing exactly the same physics , but in one less dimension , and located on the boundary of the space . I 've seen some mumbo jumbo associated with the idea in the popular science literature , but the science and mathematics is really there , it 's really real , and there are good reasons for believing that the universe is a hologram . TL;DR : The entropy of something tells us how much info there is inside it . Black Holes are maximum entropy objects , and so contain maximum information . A Black Holes entropy is proportional to it 's surface area , not it 's volume . So the information a Black Hole contains can be though of as living on it 's surface . So a Black Hole is like a hologram . If Black Holes are described like holograms , then we are too !"", 'The mods have made this the official thread for the topic . Please post related questions here to avoid flooding ELI5 with very similar questions . Thanks !', ""Forget the hologram bit for a minute . The important part is more like this : Let 's say you want to store your information ( like the data on your hard drive ) as densely as possible . And let 's say you 've packed it as tight as the laws of physics allows . What are the constraints ? You would think that the amount of information you can store would be proportional to the volume -- to the 3D space that the storage unit takes up . You 'd be wrong , according the theory and the observations that support it . It turns out that any information stored inside that space can be equivalently stored on the * boundary * -- i.e. any information storage you accomplish by using the volume can be accomplished by just using the boundary . This is because ( massive simplification ) , the most information - dense things we know are black holes , and yet everything there is to know about them is found on the outside ; information * ca n't * leave the inside . This is surprising because it means that the information you can store in a sphere is proportional to the * square * of its radius ( surface area = 4 \\ * pi \\ * r\\^2 ) rather than its cube ( volume = ( 4/3 ) \\ * pi \\ * r\\^3 ) .

Inbreeding increases the frequency of homozygous individuals- those with two of the same allele for a gene .

If that terrible trait is tied to a recessive gene , then it can continue to be passed down , kinda hiding . But when you get to inbreeding , you 're mating with incredibly similar genetic material , so all those recessive genes start to pair up and present themselves .

With a 2020 population of 1,386,932,[11] it is the eighth most populous city in the United States and the seat of San Diego County, the fifth most populous county in the United States, with 3,338,330 estimated residents as of 2019. The city is known for its mild year-round climate, natural deep-water harbor, extensive beaches and parks, long association with the United States Navy, and recent emergence as a healthcare and biotechnology development center. San Diego is the second largest city in the state of California, after Los Angeles.\nHistorically home to the Kumeyaay people, San Diego is frequently referred to as the ""Birthplace of California"", as it was the first site visited and settled by Europeans on what is now the U.S. west coast.[12] Upon landing in San Diego Bay in 1542, Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo claimed the area for Spain, forming the basis for the settlement of Alta California 200 years later. The Presidio and Mission San Diego de Alcalá, founded in 1769, formed the first European settlement in what is now California. In 1821, San Diego became part of the newly declared Mexican Empire, which reformed as the First Mexican Republic two years later. California became part of the U.S. in 1848 following the Mexican–American War and was admitted to the union as a state in 1850.\nSan Diego\'s main economic engines are military and defense-related activities, tourism, international trade, research, and manufacturing. The city is the economic center of the San Diego–Tijuana conurbation, the second most populous transborder metropolitan area in the Western Hemisphere (after Detroit–Windsor), home to an estimated 4,922,723 people as of 2012.[13] The primary border crossing between San Diego and Tijuana, the San Ysidro Port of Entry, is the busiest international land border crossing in the world outside of Asia (fourth-busiest overall). The city\'s airport, San Diego International Airport, is the busiest single-runway airport in the world.[a][14]']",0,real

It is now adopted widely and becoming an alternative to the decision tree which typically suffers from exponential growth in number of branches with each variable modeled.  ID is directly applicable in team decision analysis, since it allows incomplete sharing of information among team members to be modeled and solved explicitly.

430,430,"['Most "" swear words "" fall into two categories : sacrilegious and vulgar . One offends God , the other marks you as someone of low standing . Sacrilegious swears ( "" God damn it ! "" "" Jesus Christ ! "" ) are discouraged by the religion , for that religion \'s purposes ( Thou shalt not take the Lord \'s name in vain ) . Vulgar swears ( "" shit "" , "" piss "" , "" asshole "" , "" fuck "" , etc . ) are frowned upon because it is generally considered impolite to discuss bodily functions in public , and all of these words refer to bodily or sexual function .

There are a lot of theories as to why we swear , but it can not be pinned down to one reason . Swearing is one of very few true linguistic universals ; there has been no language found which does not have certain words which are considered \' taboo \' . Silverton presents an idea that \' regular word + emotion = swear word \' , because swear words so often appeal to deep - rooted concepts to which all people have intrinsic emotional ties : religion ( for example , the \' worst \' nineteenth - century Belgian swear was "" Sacré nom du Dieu ! "" ( * Holy name of God * ) , which was all Baudelaire was left with after his stroke ) , excrement ( inciting disgust ) , sex and genitalia , and race . The dominance of different swears can demonstrate changing attitudes in society : for example , religious swears used to be incredibly powerful in Europe , but largely became superceded by sex - related ones ( see : \' fuck \' and \' cunt \' , especially ) , and now racial swears , which used to be considered less powerful , are increasing in their perceived offensiveness . This is very well demonstrated in the case in 2008 in which Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand left a message on the answerphone of Andrew Sachs , claiming that Russell Brand had \' fucked \' his granddaughter . There were nearly 45,000 complaints , but none of them were about the word \' fuck \' . They were concerned with the invasion of the privacy both of the actor Sachs and his granddaughter without their consent , and the attitudes presented by Ross and Brand . The use of the word \' fuck \' was referred to only once in the thirty - seven page report on the matter . Compare this with the incident a year later , in 2009 , when Carol Thatcher got sacked from the BBC for referring to a black tennis player as a \' golliwog \' . Clearly racial swears are ( in Britain , at least ) on the rise as \' fuck \' makes its way out , in the eyes of the public- and clearly what is considered \' obscene \' fluctuates with attitudes in society . Ferenczi , a psychoanalyst , also presents some psychological concepts about swear words . He believes that when we swear , we are presenting people with the actual concept that they are describing : > "" An obscene word has a peculiar power of compelling the hearer to imagine the object it denotes , the sexual organ or function , * in substantial actuality * . "" ( emphasis not mine ) And from Silverton : > "" For [ Ferenczi ] , dirty words are somehow clearer to actions than words . They \'re not just thoughts , not just abstract , emotionless signs for things- as , say , \' table \' is English and \' tisch \' ist auf Deutsch . Ferenczi reckoned that dirty words had a different relationship to the things they did ambassadorial work for . In a way , they were the thing itself . Obviously not completely but kind of . Which is where they got their impact , their power ... Words for certain things- gods and bits of the body , mostly- are tabooed , because they are conflated or confused with the thing itself . "" Another linguist , Sidney J. Baker , believes that "" word - taboos , both in current society and in primitive tribes are concerned not with erasing certain words from the vocabulary , but with preserving those words in their most highly - affective forms "" . Basically , if they became widely used their power would be diluted- and they would no longer be swears . There is a desire to sustain that power they contain , for whatever reason . There are some wackier ideas , such as the one presented by Dr Olga Penavin , who claimed that swearing was as a result of capitalism , and that socialism would resolve societal conflicts which were the cause of swearing , but that seems unlikely . I actually disagree with /u / blargleblaggo that it is purely a matter of class , though that comes into play , because I do not believe swearing is a purely societal phenomenon . Rich and powerful people swear ; the reason it \'s often censored or hidden is because swearing appeals to innate , personal , taboo topics which people become offended at having been brought out into the open , and people of high social standing do n\'t want to be seen associating with those concepts- but they do n\'t * decide * what swear words are ; that concept already exists . I do n\'t think swearing , or \' making \' certain words vulgar , is a tool of those with the economic and power to separate themselves from those who don\'t- certainly there \'s more to it than that . It \'s misguided to assume that someone ever \' decided \' they are inappropriate . Swearing is a social linguistic phenomenon which does not occur because someone sits down and goes \' Right lads , THIS is what is offensive \' . As with so much in language change , it \'s impossible to determine what is the provenance of such things , and applying concepts such as "" oh , the powerful * decide * what is \' vulgar \' "" actually for the large part dismisses what a complex and innate phenomenon it actually is . Neurology can explain a lot here . Basically , although most language is stored in the left side of the brain , it does n\'t contain all of it . The right side of the brain holds the bits of language we use without thinking : "" Hello , how are you ? "" ; "" Fine thanks , you ? "" ; "" Not bad "" ... and so on . It also contains things like song lyrics , prayers and proverbs- and swear words . People with left - brain damage after strokes often struggle to grasp the meaning of words with which they are presented , but can grasp emotional connotations . Such people often tend to be left only with swears as their entire linguistic ability . A good example is Baudelaire , who was only capable of saying "" cré nom ! "" , a couple of syllables of the powerful Belgian swear indicated above , because his left hemisphere was damaged but the right was largely untouched . Therefore , swearing is n\'t a purely social phenomenon . It \'s psychological and neurological too ; you also find this with people with Tourette \'s Syndrome , for whom swear words are so often the ones which are chosen to be repeated ( though not always ) . The internal , emotional power of swears can not be underestimated , and can not simply be explained away as being the cause of \' society \' , and those with power within it . If you \'re really curious about this topic , I heartily recommend * Filthy English * by Peter Silverton ; it \'s got whole chapters on individual kinds of swear words ( female genitalia , male genitalia , excrement , sex , profanity , race words , etc . ) and loads of history , theories and examples from different languages . From this book : > Our need to swear , our drive to swear , our determination to express otherwise inexpressible parts of ourselves , that will never go . It \'s a pointer to our emotions , to our secret passions- not just sexual but more generally personal . It \'s a window into the hidden narrative inside us all . Even euphemism and minced oaths- and those who use them- are back - handed acknowledgments of swearing \'s power and significance . If- impossible thought- swearing were to disappear , we would lose an essential , ancient part of what it means to be human . We are , in a way , what we swear .']",0,real

You can think of this as the computer translating the movie into DVD language that all DVD players know how to understand . Once it is ready , your computer will start writing the data onto the disk . There is a certain format that it has to follow that includes some things that have to be written at the start point of the DVD / CD ( this basically tells the player reading the disk later what is on the disk and what data to expect ) this starting section is sometimes called the "" header "" or "" lead in "" and could be considered like a table of contents for the disk , that tells you where the different sections are located . Following the header , the main data portion is written to the disk , which contains the actual movie / game / program / songs you are burning on the disk , and at the end a closing portion to signify the end of the disk . Let \'s look at how the data is stored physically . CDs and DVDs are digital information storage systems , that means that they store information as a long series of 1 \'s and 0 \'s ( binary ) , the same representation used by computers . 1 \'s and 0 \'s are represented on the physical disk as "" pits "" these are little indentations in the structure of the disk that are made by your disk burner by burning the disk with a laser .

Some advantages to CDs / DVDs . They are fairly small and lightweight , easy to take with you . And while they are certainly breakable , they do n\'t break very easily , so it is a fairly safe way to store your data . It also takes 0 power to maintain the data , with some data storage techniques there must be a battery present to keep the data alive , on a disk it does n\'t require any maintenance . Also CDs and DVDs are both widely used , so it is a format that is easy to find hardware / software for . I can burn a cd on my computer and we can play it in any cd player . As for similar things , you can look at magnetic based data storage like VHS tapes , computer backup tapes , cassette tapes , hard drives , etc .

Computers actually store the 1s and 0s in a number of different ways , depending on what is most useful for a given situation . When a computer is just thinking to itself , it will probably store the 0s as a low voltage signal and the 1s as a high voltage signal . When the computer wants to save the information for long term storage , it will write the information out to the hard drive . Instead of using high and low voltages , it will orient tiny magnetic fields . One direction represents a 0 and the opposite direction represents a 1 . CDs use yet another method . When your computer tries to read a CD it shines a tiny laser at the surface of the CD . If light is reflected back , it interprets it as a 1 . If light is * not * reflected back , it interprets it as a 0 . CDs you buy from a record store or movie store probably use tiny little indentations called "" pits "" to ensure the laser light from the computer will not be reflected back ( a 0 ) . An absence of a pit means light will be reflected back ( a 1 ) . Writable CDs ( CDs that can only be written to once ) have a layer of very reflective material built into them .

Purple was never widely used , but that it was used for the most secret communication meant that breaking it was important . The German "" [ Enigma ] ( URL_4 ) "" machine is the best known one because it was so widely used and as a result it gave the German \'s a huge advantage , and required a very large scale operation to keep up with decrypting all of the messages .

The rotors mapped one character onto another , and the plugboard did the same thing only in a more flexible way . Each day started with a set of rotors ( 336 possibilities ) in particular positions ( 17,576 possibilities ) , and the plugboard ( with 10 connections in it that gave 150,738,274,937,250 possibles ) . Each message started with a three letter key ( encrypted with the daily key ) that specified the position of the rotors to encrypt the actual message . When a character is typed it sends an electrical signal through the rotors to the plug board , which then reflects the signal back through the rotors again and illuminates one of the lights . The rotors then turn so the next character is encrypted differently . [ Correction : When a character is typed it sends an electrical signal through the plug board to the rotors , to a reflector that sends the signal back through the rotors again , through the plug board again and illuminates one of the lights . ] When the German navy moved from a 3 to 4 rotor Enigma , Bletchly Park needed better tools , so developed the first electronic computer to help with the decryption . One of the bright people working at Bletchly Park was [ Alan Turing ] ( URL_6 ) , who did a lot of early work on general purpose electronic computers .

The Codebreakers in Bletchley park performed astonishing feats of mathematics , reasoning , deduction , and inspiration , and came up with a way to read enigma - encrypted messages . This means that , for quite some time , the allies were aware of the German plans and intentions and activities . They were extremely careful to come up with ways to pretend that they had learned things in other ways , so that the Germans would continue to trust and use enigma .

455,455,"[""The IRS defines income quite specifically. On the topic What is Taxable and Nontaxable Income, they note: You can receive income in the form of money, property, or services. This section discusses many kinds of income that are taxable or nontaxable. It includes discussions on employee wages and fringe benefits, and income from bartering, partnerships, S corporations, and royalties.  Bartering, or giving someone wages (or similar) in something other than currency (or some other specifically defined things, like fringe benefits), is taxed at fair market value: Bartering Bartering is an exchange of property or services. You must include in your income, at the time received, the fair market value of property or services you receive in bartering. For additional information, Refer to Tax Topic 420 - Bartering Income and Barter Exchanges. Bartering is more specifically covered in Topic 420 - Bartering Income: You must include in gross income in the year of receipt the fair market value of goods or services received from bartering. Generally, you report this income on Form 1040, Schedule C (PDF), Profit or Loss from Business (Sole Proprietorship), or Form 1040, Schedule C-EZ (PDF), Net Profit from Business (Sole Proprietorship). If you failed to report this income, correct your return by filing a Form 1040X (PDF), Amended U.S. Individual Income Tax Return. Refer to Topic 308 for information on filing an amended return. More details about income in general beyond the above articles is available in Publication 525, Taxable and Nontaxable Income.  It goes into great detail about different kinds of income. In your example, you'd have to calculate the fair market value of an avocado, and then determine how much cash-equivalent you were paid in.  The IRS wouldn't necessarily tell you what that value was; you'd calculate it based on something you feel you could justify to them afterwards.  The way I'd do it would be to write down the price of avocados at each pay period, and apply a dollar-cost-averaging type method to determine the total pay's fair value.   While the avocado example is of course largely absurd, the advent of bitcoins has made this much more relevant.  Publication 525 has this to say about virtual currency: Virtual Currency.   If your employer gives you virtual currency (such as Bitcoin) as payment for your services, you must include the fair market value of the currency in your income. The fair market value of virtual currency (such as Bitcoin) paid as wages is subject to federal income tax withholding, Federal Insurance Contribution Act (FICA) tax, and Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) tax and must be reported on Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement. Gold would be fundamentally similar - although I am not sure it's legal to pay someone in gold; assuming it were, though, its fair market value would be again the definition of income.  Similarly, if you're paid in another country's currency, the US dollar equivalent of that is what you'll pay taxes on, at the fair market value of that currency in US dollars.""]",0,real

459,459,"['As already noted, options contain inherent leverage (a multiplier on the profit or loss). The amount of ""leverage"" is dictated primarily by both the options strike relative to the current share price and the time remaining to expiration. Options are a far more difficult investment than stocks because they require that you are right on both the direction and the timing of the future price movement. With a stock, you could choose to buy and hold forever (Buffett style), and even if you are wrong for 5 years, your unrealized losses can suddenly become realized profits if the shares finally start to rise 6 years later. But with options, the profits and losses become very final very quickly. As a professional options trader, the single best piece of advice I can give to investors dabbling in options for the first time is to only purchase significantly ITM (in-the-money) options, for both calls and puts. Do a web search on ""in-the-money options"" to see what calls or puts qualify.  With ITM options, the leverage is still noticeably better than buying/selling the shares outright, but you have a much less chance of losing all your premium. Also, by being fairly deep in-the-money, you reduce the constant bleed in value as you wait for the expected move to happen (the market moves sideways more than people usually expect). Fairly- to deeply-ITM options are the ones that options market-makers like least to trade in, because they offer neither large nor ""easy"" premiums. And options market-makers make their living by selling options to retail investors and other people that want them like you, so connect the dots. By trading only ITM options until you become quite experienced, you are minimizing your chances of being the average sucker (all else equal). Some amateur options investors believe that similar benefits could be obtained by purchasing long-expiration options (like LEAPS for 1+ years) that are not ITM (like ATM or OTM options). The problem here is that your significant time value is bleeding away slowly every day you wait.  With an ITM option, your intrinsic value is not bleeding out at all. Only the relatively smaller time value of the option is at risk. Thus my recommendation to initially deal only in fairly- to deeply-ITM options with expirations of 1-4 months out, depending on how daring you wish to be with your move timing.']",0,real

467,467,"[""It 's all about range and the ability to attack at range . In WWII , when battleships were still being used in significant numbers , the upper limit of your ability to attack the enemy was limited by your ability to visually see the target . That visual limit was the curvature of the earth ( since oceans are relative ' flat ' surface ) . A battleship could only reliably attack what it could visually see . And given that boats were big , relatively slow moving things , you wanted to know where your enemies were so you could begin moving towards them . Recon planes aided battleships to an extent , but it did not drastically increase their ability to hit targets at extreme ranges . Even the advent of radar did not help battleships because the curvature of the earth still inhibits their ability to see . Enter the aircraft carrier - a ship capable of launching attack planes that could not only go beyond the curvature of the planet , but attack targets as well . All of a sudden , you have a ship capable of spotting and destroying targets beyond visual range in a reliable fashion . This is a huge advantage in naval warfare because , unlike in ground combat , you have no cover - you 're best means of defense is keeping as much distance between you and your opponent as possible . The ability to attack targets that are incapable of retaliating against your ships is a massive advantage . And since boats are , again , slow moving things , a battleship has no real means to engage an aircraft carrier . It can not ' surprise ' one because it will be seen coming from miles away by the planes . If a battleship could suddenly plop itself within gun range of an aircraft carrier , it would be a no - contest for the battleship to win . But that will never be the case , and thus the battleship fell into obsolescence . Cost of building / maintaining only entered into the equation in the sense that you do n't spend money on things that are n't useful ; and battleships simply were n't useful anymore in naval warfare . Ground combat , however , is a much different story than naval warfare . You might have guns that let you shoot as far as your eyes can see , but there might be hills , mountains , and buildings in the way . The terrain obstructs your ability to see enemies , and thus your ability to keep them at a distance . As a result , you can not necessarily rely on weapons that have limited defenses in close - ranges because you have less effective control over your ability to keep distance . But when those distances can be maintained , you do see extensive use of these long - range tools - artillery cannons and airstrips allow one to , again , engage at long range with limited enemy ability to retaliate . And air support is becoming an increasingly larger facet of ground wars . But dense terrain , particularly urban environments , necessitate the need for an armoured vehicle that can exert great power and survive retaliation from enemies at close quarters . You can bombard a city to rubble , but in the end you 'll still need to send in the army to clear the city out , and they 'll need the armour support to maintain a tactical advantage over enemies ."", ""Tanks would be obsolete too if nations were somehow only able to field a couple of dozen of them at a time . Battleships would probably still be useful if it were n't for the fact that they cost billions to build and maintain , but can still be destroyed by a single lucky plane . If they could somehow magically prevent all air attack , nations would almost certainly start building the things again :)"", ""Battleships became obsolete because of technological advancements and changing naval warfare tactics and combat scenarios . With the development of long range radar and accurate missile systems , the battleship 's large caliber guns became outdated and a hindrance to modern naval combat . Could the battleship 's guns be made to fire at a greater range ? Yes , however you still generally would need to fire more rounds than missiles to disable an enemy vessel . Missiles took away the need for large storage space of rounds / powder . The reduced storage allowed smaller faster ships to be made , that are just as deadly , if not more so . Generally now , the key to strong naval warfare is detection and range . Large naval guns required you to position your ship closer to threats , compared with missile paired with radar guidance . Naval shore bombardment is now done with aircraft and tomahawk cruise missiles . Both allow the ships to stay far off shore , which is much safer . Tanks operate on different battlefield . If you send in just a battalion of tanks and men , generally they will be firing on targets that are seen and not over the horizon . On land , you ca n't shoot out a radar signal hundreds of miles ( hills and other obstacles restrict it ) and ground targets are not easily picked up because of those obstructions . Tanks could switch to just missiles , however you 're still generally firing on something that is seen and is in range of your main turret . So why not go the cheaper route and use the turret and have just a couple missiles on stand by for larger targets and threats . The tanks tactics have changed since tanks were initially used long ago , however they have not changed as drastic as sea warfare . There is still a high need for a large mobile armored gun for land warfare . And as an add in , naval gunfire is not obsolete in itself . The Navy still does Naval Surface Fire Support ( i.e. gunfire offshore onto land based targets ) . However , those missions are not a common occurrence because once the ship can operate that close to shore safely , generally the fight will have moved deeper inland and out of the large guns ' range ( 10 - 15 miles ) . You do n't have large opposed amphibious landings like back in WWII nowadays . Lastly , something that is currently in development and would probably lead to more naval gunfire again is the rail gun . It provides a longer range , ~100 nautical miles , and the added benefit of not having to have powder charges stored on board to launch the projectile . The rail gun could bring the navy ship to a somewhat similar situation to the tank . You have an enemy that you can ' see ' ( with radar / eyes ) and you have an option to fire a missile or standard round , you 'll probably fire many large gun rounds since it would be much cheaper than missiles . You can save the missiles for when the advantages they provide are needed immediately and necessary . * * * TL;DR * * * Development of long range radar and missiles took away the main need for very large naval guns . Large naval guns required you to be close , comparatively to missiles , to enemies . Long range radar does not work well on land trying to search for ground targets , there are too many obstructions . Tanks will generally see their enemy , which would be in range of either missile or it 's main turret , and it 's much cheaper to fire that turret with out losing too much in advantages . Navy rail gun could bring back more naval gun fire to future combat scenarios , but still not like it used to be in my opinion .""]",0,real

Growth in other parts of EU was pushing up costs . * Greece has had a long problem with tax evasion and an unwillingness to tax the rich , because they would just leave . As with a lot of the rest of the world the economic growth that did exist was entirely for the rich , so there was no increase in income or sales tax revenue . * Germany violated the [ EU Sustainability and Growth Pact from 2003 - 2007 ] ( URL_2 ) .

Part of the reason for the pact was to keep the EU growth in step , but no one else wanted to slow down when they had a chance to "" win "" . * From 2004 - 2009 Government debt grew . This was partly because of a decade of low interest rates . Cheap loans caused household , corporate and government debt to grow . Was it a bad idea ? Most financial advisers would say it \'s smart to borrow to grow when money is cheap . The European banks certainly borrowed more heavily than Greece ever did . * 2007 - 2008 there was a global financial crisis . This caused a huge jump in unemployment which increased welfare costs . These expenses rose just as tax revenues dropped . The problem was worse in countries that had seen a property boom , like Greece . * Bank bailouts . The banks \' , which borrowed even more aggressively than Greece did , ran into financial problems which meant that some countries ( most notably Ireland and Spain , but also Greece ) needed to find money to support them , while other countries left them to fail ( really only Iceland ) . * A lot of the Greek debt was to other European countries , so Germany was putting a lot of pressure on Greece to not default on the loans . Germany thinks that investments in Greece should have no risk because Greece should n\'t be allowed to default . In some ways the German government loans to Greece can be seen as a way to subsidize Germans speculating in the Greek real - estate market . * Once it became clear that Greek loans were not zero - risk , and some would not be paid off , some investors wanted better interest rates , and others just walked away . This caused falling bond prices , higher interest , and slower growth . * The EU aid to Greece was never realistic and the repayment terms just made things worse . The Greek austerity measures pushed by Germany are [ comparable to the German austerity measures after WW1 ] ( URL_5 ) which were a complete failure .

If this happens slowly , it 's more like a traditional fire : Heat and gas separate off of the burning mass at a rate ( which is actually controlled by how quickly the substrate heats up in the presence of its own fire ) . C4 does not require oxygen to burn so as it heats up the fire intensity will increase . So to answer your question , you have to understand that there are two ways to break the bonds in C4 . A significant impact ( ~~a bullet~~ apparently probably not a bullet , but definitely a priming charge ) will do the trick , and so will heat .

483,483,"[""What do you see as the advantage of doing this? When you buy a house with a mortgage, the bank gets a lien on the house you are buying, i.e. the house you are buying is the collateral. Why would you need additional or different collateral? As to using the house for your down payment, that would require giving the house to the seller, or selling the house and giving the money to the seller. If the house was 100% yours and you don't have any use for it once you buy the second house, that would be a sensible plan. Indeed that's what most people do when they buy a new house: sell the old one and use the money as down payment on the new one. But in this case, what would happen to the co-owner? Are they going to move to the new house with you? The only viable scenario I see here is that you could get a home equity loan on the first house, and then use that money as the down payment on the second house, and thus perhaps avoid having to pay for mortgage insurance. As DanielAnderson says, the bank would probably require the signature of the co-owner in such a case. If you defaulted on the loan, the bank could then seize the house, sell it, and give the co-owner some share of the money. I sincerely doubt the bank would be interested in an arrangement where if you default, they get half interest in the house but are not allowed to sell it without the co-owner's consent. What would a bank do with half a house? Maybe, possibly they could rent it out, but most banks are not in the rental business. So if you defaulted, the co-owner would get kicked out of the house.

Imagine the buyer agrees that you buy only 70% of the house right now, and the remaining 30% in 7 years time.  It would be obviously fair to pay 70% of today's value today, pay 30% of a reasonable rent for 7 years (because 30% of the house isn't owned by you), then pay 30% of the value that the house has in 7 years time. 30% of the value in 7 years is the same as 30% of the value today, plus 30% of whatever the house gained in value.  Instead you pay 70% of today's value, you pay no rent for the 30% that you don't own, then in 7 years time you pay 30% of today's value, plus 50% of whatever the house gained in value.

506,506,"['Sorry in advance, but this will be long.  Also, it sounds like your friend is a tool. I hope this ""friend"" is not also your financial advisor... they would be encouraging you to make a very poor investment decision. They also don\'t know how to do financial math.  For what it\'s worth, I am not wrong. I have correctly answered a set of changing questions as you have asked them... Your friend is answering based on a third, completely different investment model, which you proposed in the edit to your last post. If that\'s what you meant all along, then you should have been more clear in the questions you were asking.  Please let me layout the following: How the previous questions//investment proposals were built How to analyze this current proposal What your other option is Why the other option is best in a \'real world\' market The First Question My understanding of the initial proposal was to take out a $10,000 loan, invest the proceeds, and expect to not have any money of your own tied up in this. Because that OP did not specify that this is an interest-only loan (you still haven\'t in any of your questions), the bank will require you to make payments back to them each month that include principal and interest.  Your ""friend"" is talking about the total interest paid being the only cost of a loan. While that is (almost) true, regardless of what your friend says, significantly more cash is involved in making sure that all the payments are made on time---unless you set up an interest-only loan. But with the set up laid out in this post, and with the assumptions I specified there, the principal payments must be included because the borrower has to pay back the bank and isn\'t not tying up any of their own money.  In that case, my initial analysis is correct--your breakeven is in the low teens for an annual required return.  The Second Proposal Your second proposal... before any edits... refined things a little bit, to try to capture the any possible returns by not selling something. As I indicated there, (with what was an exaggerating assumption), the lack of clarity makes for an outlandish required return.  The Second Proposal...with edits, or the one proposed above I will get to the one proposed above in a second, but first let me highlight a few problems with your friend\'s analysis.  Simple interest: the only place (in the US at least) that will lend with simple interest is student loans. Any loan that you actually take out will be compound interest.  Not an interest only loan: your ""friend"" is not calculating interest correctly. Since this isn\'t an interest-only loan, the principal balance will reduce every time you make a payment, by ~$320-$340 each month. This substantially reduces the total interest paid, to $272.79 over the total 24 months.  ""Returns"": I don\'t know what country, or what business your friend works in, but ""returns"" are a very ambiguous concept. Investopedia defines returns as gains or losses. (I wish I could inhabit the lala land that your friend lives in when returns are always positive). TheFreeDictionary.com defines a return for finance as ""The change in the value of a portfolio over an evaluation period, including any distributions made from the portfolio during that period.""  When you have not made it clear that any other money is being used in this investment plan (as was the case in scheme #1 and scheme #2a,) the loan still has to be paid. So, clearly the principal must be included in the return calculations.  How to evaluate this proposed investment scheme Key dimensions: Loan ($8,000 ... 24 months ... 0.27% monthly rate... monthly compounding... no loan origination fees) Monthly payment (PMT in Excel yields $344.70). Investment capital (starting = $8,000) Monthly Return (Investment yields... we hope it\'s positive!)  Your monthly contribution from your salary Taxes = 10%. Transaction Fees = $20  Go and lookup how to build an amortization table for a loan in Excel. Your life will be infinitely better for it.  Now, you get this loan set up and invested into something... (it costs $20 to buy the assets).  So you\'ve got $7980 chugging away earning interest. I calculate that your break even, with you paying in $344.70 of your own money each month is 1.81% annually, or 3.42% over the 24 month life of this scheme. That is using monthly compound interest for the payments, because that\'s what the real world would use, and using monthly compounding of the investments\' returns.  Your total interest expense would be $272.79.  This seems feasible. But let\'s talk about what your other option is, given that you\'re ready to spend $344.70 each month on an investment.  Your other option  I understand the appeal of getting $8,000... right away... to invest in something. But the risk behind this is that if the market goes down (and markets do) you\'re stuck paying a fixed amount for your loan that is now worth less money.  Your other option is to take your $344.70, and invest it step-by-step. (You would want to skip a month or two buying assets in the market, so that you can lessen transaction costs). This has two advantages: (1) you save yourself $272 in interest. (2) When the market goes down, you still win.  With this strategy, you still win when the market goes down because of what is commonly called ""dollar cost averaging"". When the market is up, your investments are also up. When the market goes down, your previous investments decrease in value but you can invest new money at the lower rates.  Why the step-by-step, invest your own money strategy is better At low rates (when you\'re looking for your break-even), the step-by-step model outperforms the loan. At higher rates of return (~4% + per year), you get the benefit of having the borrowed money earning more gains.  In fact, for every continuous (meaning set... not changing month-to-month) interest rate that you can dream up that is greater than about 4% per year, the borrowed money earns more.  At 10% per year, the borrowed money will earn about $500 more over the 2 years than your step by step investment would.  BUT I recognize that you might feel like the market will always go up. That\'s what everyone thinks. And that\'s alright.  But have one really bad month, or a couple of just-not-great-months, and your fixed \'loan\' portfolio will underperform. Have a few really bad months, and your portfolio could be substantially reduced in value... but you would still be paying the same amount for it each month.  And if that happened (say your assets declined -3% in 3 of the 24 months...) You\'d be losing money relative to the step-by-step portfolio.']",0,real

516,516,"['In order to understand how much you might gain or lose from participating in the futures markets, it is important to first understand the different ways in which the slope of the futures markets can be described. In many of the futures markets there is a possibility of somebody buying a commodity at the spot price and selling a futures contract on it. In order to do this they need to hold the commodity in storage. Most commodities cost money to hold in storage, so the futures price will tend to be above the spot price for these commodities.  In the case of stock index futures, the holder receives a potential benefit from holding the stocks in an index.   If the futures market is upward sloping compared to the spot price, then it can be called normal. If the futures market is usually downward sloping compared to the spot price then it can be called inverted. If the futures market is high enough above the spot price so that more of the commodity gets stored for the future, then the market can be called in contango. If the futures market is below the point where the commodity can be profitably stored for the future, and the market can be called in backwardation. In many of these cases, there is an implicit cost that the buyer of a future pays in order to hold the contract for certainly time. Your question is how much money you make if the price of gold goes up by a specific amount, or how much money you lose if the price of gold goes down by the same specific amount.  The problem is, you do not say whether it is the spot price or the futures price which goes up or down.  In most cases it is assumed that the change in the futures price will be similar to the change in the spot price of gold.  If the spot price of gold goes up by a small amount, then the futures price of gold will go up by a small amount as well.  If the futures price of gold goes up by a small amount, this will also drive the spot price of gold up.  Even for these small price changes, the expected futures price change in expected spot price change will not be exactly the same.  For larger price changes, there will be more of a difference between the expected spot price change in expected future price change.   If the price eventually goes up, then the cost of holding the contract will be subtracted from any future gains.  If the price eventually goes down, then this holding cost should be added to the losses.  If you bought the contract when it was above the spot price, the price will slowly drift toward the spot price, causing you this holding cost.  If the price of gold does not change any from the current spot price, then all you are left with is this holding cost.']",0,real

The reasons are as you mentioned, you get to apply multiple deductions/credits/exemptions to the same income. Rather than just 1 standard deduction, you get to deduct 2 standard deductions, you can double the max saved in an IRA, you benefit more from any non-refundable credits etc. This is partly due to the fact that when you are filing your taxes in Year 1, you can't include anything from Year 2 since it hasn't happened yet. It doesn't make sense for the Government to take into account actions that may or may not happen when calculating your tax bill. There are factors where other year profit/loss can affect your tax liability, however as far as I know these are limited to businesses. Look into Loss Carry Forwarded/Back if you want to know more. Regarding the '30% simple rate', I think you are confusing something that is simple to say with something that is simple to implement.  Are we going to go change the rules on people who expected their mortgage deduction to continue? There are few ways I can think of that are more sure to cause home prices to plummet than to eliminate the Mortgage Interest Deduction. What about removing Student Loan Interest? Under a 30% 'simple' rate, what tools would the government use to encourage trade in specific areas? Will state income tax deduction also be removed? This is going to punish those in a state with a high income tax more than those in states without income tax. Those are all just 'common' deductions that affect a lot of people, you could easily say 'no' to all of them and just piss off a bunch of people, but what about selling stock though? I paid $100 for the stock and I sold it for $120, do I need to pay $36 tax on that because it is a 'simple' 30% tax rate or are we allowing the cost of goods sold deduction (it's called something else I believe when talking about stocks but it's the same idea?) What about if I travel for work to tutor individuals, can I deduct my mileage expenses? Do I need to pay 30% income tax on my earnings and principal from a Roth IRA? A lot of people have contributed to a Roth with the understanding that withdrawals will be tax free, changing those rules are punishing people for using vehicles intentionally created by the government. Are we going to go around and dismantle all non-profits that subsist entirely on tax-deductible donations? Do I need to pay taxes on the employer's cost of my health insurance? What about 401k's and IRA's? Being true to a 'simple' 30% tax will eliminate all 'benefits' from every job as you would need to pay taxes on the value of the benefits. I should mention that this isn't exactly too crazy, there was a relatively recent IRS publication about businesses needing to withhold taxes from their employees for the cost of company supplied food but I don't know if it was ultimately accepted. At the end of the day, the concept of simplifying the tax law isn't without merit, but realize that the complexities of tax law are there due to the complexities of life.

540,540,"[""Firstly , you need to understand that music , like all sound , is in essence , a wave . You most certainly have seen graphic illustrations of sound , well , music is no different . Now then , there are 2 types of radio waves , AM or Amplitude Modulation and FM or Frequency Modulation . Lets start with the simpler AM . A normal non modulated carrier wave ( which is the wave we will modulate the signal onto , ( just bear with me here ) ) is a simple sine wave . It goes up from zero to a maximum called the amplitude , back down to zero and down to the negative of the amplitude . Now you can see this signal changes in the time domain , but at any instance , it really only has 2 properties : amplitude and frequency ( technically you can add phase too , but we wo nt need that here ) . Now you can chance the amplitude over time , which is called modulating , and with a special circuit that is present in you radio , you can sense the amplitude of a signal at any time ( even when not in the maximum points of the carrier wave ) . Once you know you can do this , it 's easy to understand that if you multiply your original wave ( the music ) with this carrier wave , you get a complex signal , but it 's in essence the carrier wave where the amplitude differs according to the music . One reason why they do this and not simply transmit the music is because now you can have different radio stations on different frequencies . Now , as a I mentioned in the beginning , you also have the more popular FM . Here , instead of changing the amplitude of the carrier wave , you will change its other property , the frequency . The technical and mathimatical details get a little more complex here but you can view it as exactly the same principle and just know there are ways to extract the information from that wave again . If you want more details , just ask ."", ""There are several ways to get light ( or other electromagnetic waves , like radio ) to carry information . One simple way is to use signalling . You can pulse the light on and off like [ Morse code ] ( URL_2 ) . As long as the sender and receiver both understand the code , you can transmit information . This is actually done in some fiber optic systems . ( They do n't use Morse code , and it is much much faster than a human could do .

If you think of EM radiation as an [ oscillating set of electric and magnetic fields ] ( URL_0 ) that change their amplitude at some very regular frequency , then you have a lot of ways to change it . If you change the amplitude as a function of the information you want to send , you 've got [ Amplitude Modulation ] ( URL_1 ) . If you change the frequency to be a bit faster / slower according to what you want to send , you 've got [ Frequency Modulation ] ( URL_1 ) . There are also other methods like Phase Modulation that are a bit more complicated .

Think of FM as changing the color of the light very slightly , very rapidly , according to the information you want to send . Of course , you ca n't see radio waves because the human eye does n't detect them , but the concept is exactly the same .

Since those electrons are moving with certain frequencies and amplitudes ( how frequently they oscillate and how hard ) , they push other electrons along the antenna all the way down into the radio . The oscillation is detected and amplified ( you pushing one swing gets turned into a million swings ) . The amplified oscillation is used to drive the speaker 's cone on the radio .

Ants evolved from vespoid wasp ancestors in the Cretaceous period. More than 13,800 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified. They are easily identified by their geniculate (elbowed) antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists.\nAnts form colonies that range in size from a few dozen predatory individuals living in small natural cavities to highly organised colonies that may occupy large territories and consist of millions of individuals. Larger colonies consist of various castes of sterile, wingless females, most of which are workers (ergates), as well as soldiers (dinergates) and other specialised groups. Nearly all ant colonies also have some fertile males called ""drones"" and one or more fertile females called ""queens"" (gynes). The colonies are described as superorganisms because the ants appear to operate as a unified entity, collectively working together to support the colony.\nAnts have colonised almost every landmass on Earth. The only places lacking indigenous ants are Antarctica and a few remote or inhospitable islands. Ants thrive in moist tropical ecosystems and may exceed the combined biomass of wild birds and mammals. Their success in so many environments has been attributed to their social organisation and their ability to modify habitats, tap resources, and defend themselves. Their long co-evolution with other species has led to mimetic, commensal, parasitic, and mutualistic relationships.\nAnt societies have division of labour, communication between individuals, and an ability to solve complex problems. These parallels with human societies have long been an inspiration and subject of study. Many human cultures make use of ants in cuisine, medication, and rites. Some species are valued in their role as biological pest control agents. Their ability to exploit resources may bring ants into conflict with humans, however, as they can damage crops and invade buildings. Some species, such as the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta) of South America, are regarded as invasive species in other parts of the world, establishing themselves in areas where they have been introduced accidentally.']",0,real

A SIEM system combines outputs from multiple sources and uses alarm filtering techniques to distinguish malicious activity from false alarms.\nIDS types range in scope from single computers to large networks. The most common classifications are network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) and host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDS).

The most well-known variants are signature-based detection (recognizing bad patterns, such as malware) and anomaly-based detection (detecting deviations from a model of ""good"" traffic, which often relies on machine learning). Another common variant is reputation-based detection (recognizing the potential threat according to the reputation scores). Some IDS products have the ability to respond to detected intrusions. Systems with response capabilities are typically referred to as an intrusion prevention system. Intrusion detection systems can also serve specific purposes by augmenting them with custom tools, such as using a honeypot to attract and characterize malicious traffic.']",0,real

Anti - feminists often say that society is also not equal for men and that women have more rights in child custody and divorce . Some say that feminism wants women to be more important than men . Some argue that women and men have simple biological differences , and thus can not be treated in the same way . Some examples are : the treatment and role of women in the military and pregnancy only happens to women . Some people do not like feminism because it wants to change society and it could make men have less power . Feminism could give women special rights that would then hurt other groups and their rights . An example would be a fear that women would take away jobs normally done by men . Some religious people say that feminism is not what God wanted . For example , in Genesis chapter 2 it says that God made Eve ( the first woman ) as a companion for Adam ( the first man ) and some think this means he made women to serve men . But some feel that God created men and women to be equal ( see Ephesians 5:21 ) . This leads to Christian and Jewish denominations differing on the ordination of women ( whether women can be official leaders in a church . See also Women in Islam . There are also many other types of anti - feminism . Writers such as Camille Paglia , Christina Hoff Sommers , Jean Bethke Elshtain , Elizabeth Fox - Genovese and Daphne Patai oppose some forms of feminism , though they identify as feminists . They argue , for example , that feminism often promotes misandry ( hatred of men ) and the elevation of women \'s interests above men \'s , and criticize radical feminist positions as harmful to both men and women .

This means you can access them very quickly, without taking on losses. To get the most liquidity out of your bonds, you can do what is called 'laddering'. This means that you take out different bond amounts with different maturity dates, and periodically renew them on a schedule, so that you always have some bonds maturing, which you can access without paying an interest penalty. You can look this term up online for more details. Cash and bonds are low risk. If you have absolutely no low-risk assets, then in the event of, say, a market crash, you may have no savings to fall back on. By owning some bonds, and some equities, you are able to earn a modest return, without being too risky. However, note that some bonds are just as risky as equities - any bond which pays an abnormally high interest rate does so because the entity backing the repayment (government, company, whomever) is thought to not be guaranteed to be able to do so. The 25% figure given by your author is his opinion on the appropriate mix of cash/bonds to equities, but there are many views on the matter.

581,581,"['It \'s all to do with how the game interacts with the operating system . This is different between different operating systems . For example : * * System calls * * System calls are a way for a program ( in this case , the game ) to communicate with the operating system . For example , if the game needs to open a file , it sends a system call to the operating system saying "" get me this file "" . Exactly how system calls are done varies from one operating system to the next . Each OS will generally have a similar set of system calls to other operating systems , but the specifics are different ( different method of making system calls , different names , different parameters ( parameters are how you pass information to a system call , so for example , the name of the file you want to open would be a parameter ) , etc . ) . * * File and directory structure * * Windows and Linux have different standards for how files are organised on your hard disk . When you install a program on Windows , it usually creates a folder for that program within C:\\Program Files\\ , and the files that program needs are placed in that folder . On Linux , the program itself is usually stored in a directory ( folder ) called /usr / bin , while other files needed by the program are stored in /usr / lib and /usr / share ( among other places ) . Similarly , Windows and Linux have different places that they store your settings and personal files . When porting a program between operating systems , you have to adapt it to understand and use these different ways of organizing files . * * Accessing hardware * * Windows and Linux have different ways of letting programs communicate with hardware . Of particular importance to games is graphics . Most Windows games use something called DirectX to take care of their graphics . DirectX is needed because there are a huge number of different graphics cards out there , and they all have different ways of doing things . When PC gaming first took off , game developers had to specifically design their game to support each graphics card it might be played on . This was fine in the early days when there were only a few models of graphics cards around , but nowadays there are such a huge number of cards available that it would be impossible for a game developer to design for them all individually . So Microsoft created DirectX as a standard way to talk to graphics cards . Now game developers only had to support DirectX , and it was up to each graphics card manufacturer to create drivers , which are programs that let their graphics card "" talk DirectX \'s language "" . But Linux does n\'t support DirectX. Instead , it has its own similar thing called OpenGL . OpenGL basically does the same stuff as DirectX , but it works differently . Imagine DirectX is like speaking in English and OpenGL is like speaking in French . Games that know how to work with DirectX do n\'t understand OpenGL and vice versa . So the game developers will have to modify their game to work with OpenGL , which is quite a big job because quite often the game \'s entire graphics system will be designed around DirectX. Nowadays OpenGL can run on Windows as well as Linux , so if you are writing a game that you plan to release on both platforms , it makes sense to design it to use OpenGL to begin with . But a lot of games are still build using DirectX , especially if the developer did n\'t originally plan on porting it . There are similar things for other types of hardware , such as sound cards ( WaveOut or DirectSound on Windows , ALSA or Pulse on Linux ) . These will also have to be adapted for . * * Libraries * * When you write a piece of software , you typically do n\'t create the whole thing yourself from scratch . Instead you use libraries , which are pieces of code for doing common tasks that have already been written . For example , there might be a library for playing music files . If your game needs to play back music files ( e.g. for theme music or sound effects ) , why bother writing your own code to do this when you can just use the library ? Think of it like building a house : you \'re not going to cut down a tree and make it into lumber yourself when you can just buy some ready cut wood from a builders yard . This is all great , until you decide you want to convert your game to run on Linux . Windows and Linux both come with their own set of libraries , and they are both different . This is like if you designed your house around metric fittings , only to find the shop only sells imperial . Developers will have to rewrite their game to support the different libraries . There are some libraries that are available on both Windows and Linux , and it helps if developers designed their game around these libraries where possible . But if they were n\'t planning to port their game to Linux when they first wrote it , they might have chosen to use different libraries which only work on Windows . Even where the same library is available on both platforms , sometimes there will be slight difference between the two which you \'ll have to work around . There are a lot of other differences between the two OSes , but this is already pretty long and you could write whole books on the subject ( in fact people already have ) . That said , these are some of the main ones . Hopefully this will give you a good idea of how much work is involved in porting a game , especially if that game was never design to be ported in the first place .', ""There are two different ways of telling computers to draw 3D things .

This means you need to spend a lot of time reading manuals to convert your procedures from Machine A ( Windows ) to Machine B ( Linux ) . And if you rely on a particular quirk of machine A than does n't exist in machine B , you are going to change that section completely , which often means you end up with slower code ( unacceptable in games ) .

598,598,"['Simulated annealing (SA) is a probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum of a given function. Specifically, it is a metaheuristic to approximate global optimization in a large search space for an optimization problem. It is often used when the search space is discrete (for example the traveling salesman problem, the boolean satisfiability problem, protein structure prediction, and job-shop scheduling). For problems where finding an approximate global optimum is more important than finding a precise local optimum in a fixed amount of time, simulated annealing may be preferable to exact algorithms such as gradient descent or branch and bound.\nThe name of the algorithm comes from annealing in metallurgy, a technique involving heating and controlled cooling of a material to alter its physical properties. Both are attributes of the material that depend on their thermodynamic free energy. Heating and cooling the material affects both the temperature and the thermodynamic free energy or Gibbs energy.\nSimulated annealing can be used for very hard computational optimization problems where exact algorithms fail; even though it usually achieves an approximate solution to the global minimum, it could be enough for many practical problems.\nThe problems solved by SA are currently formulated by an objective function of many variables, subject to several constraints. In practice, the constraint can be penalized as part of the objective function.\nSimilar techniques have been independently introduced on several occasions, including Pincus (1970), Khachaturyan et al (1979, 1981), Kirkpatrick, Gelatt and Vecchi (1983), and Cerny (1985). In 1983, this approach was used by Kirkpatrick, Gelatt Jr., Vecchi, for a solution of the traveling salesman problem. They also proposed its current name, simulated annealing.\nThis notion of slow cooling implemented in the simulated annealing algorithm is interpreted as a slow decrease in the probability of accepting worse solutions as the solution space is explored. Accepting worse solutions allows for a more extensive search for the global optimal solution. In general, simulated annealing algorithms work as follows. The temperature progressively decreases from an initial positive value to zero. At each time step, the algorithm randomly selects a solution close to the current one, measures its quality, and moves to it according to the temperature-dependent probabilities of selecting better or worse solutions, which during the search respectively remain at 1 (or positive) and decrease toward zero.\nThe simulation can be performed either by a solution of kinetic equations for density functions or by using the stochastic sampling method. The method is an adaptation of the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm, a Monte Carlo method to generate sample states of a thermodynamic system, published by N. Metropolis et al. in 1953.']",0,real

Well , singers cost money , and it slows them down just a bit to learn each other \'s lines . * * edit * * : anytime someone explains RAID it \'s a rule you have to say that it is not a BACKUP , it \'s a way to ensure that your data has greater uptime and/or is faster .

The plus is that you 've doubled your space and your speed . The problem is that if one drive fails , the other one is useless . RAID-1 : Files are mirrored across two hard drives . You still get a speed boost , but not a space increase . However , you also have a built in backup . If one drive fails , replace it and rebuild the RAID array , and you 're right back where you were . RAID-5 : This requires at least three disks . You spread files across all disks , but one is used as a parity disk . Here 's how parity works : You have any number of disks . At each address , the bit is either a 1 or a 0 . Now , say you have another disk that records data like this : if the total of the bits at the address on the other drive is odd , enter a 1 at the same address on the parity disk . If it 's even , enter a 0 . This way , if any of the other drives fails , even if you do n't know which , the drive with the parity data can figure out which bit each address has by algebra ."", 'You can have multiple hard disks act as a special type of single hard disk . There are different ways this can be utilized which have different benefits . One of the benefits is redundancy ( e.g. if one or sometimes even more than one disk breaks there are others with the information still ) . The other is increased speed ( e.g. you can have two disks which alternate each write operation or you can have them work independently which allows two tasks to be done at once ) .']",0,real

So the molecules in the ice are moving slower than the particles in the liquid water .

The ice particles speed up because of this collision . The temperatures of the two substances will continue to change until they are at the same temperature . Imagine walking through a crowded hallway . You are walking fast and run into someone in front of you who is walking slow . Upon colliding with them , they will speed up and you will slow down . You will continue to collide until you are both traveling at the same speed .', ""Picture water molecules as ball room dancers . We set up a dance floor with 2 groups of dancers . One group we hyped up with a motivational speech , got them all excited and pumped , so now they want to get out on the floor and dance a really fast waltz with lots of fancy moves . ( Lets call them the hot dancers ) The other group we sapped the energy out of by telling them they are bad dancers and they should be embarrassed and do n't make a fool out of themselves . ( Lets call them the cold dancers ) So when both groups get out on the dance floor the hot dancers start flying around the dance floor at such a pace they barely cling on to each other , they bounce off each other with a lot of energy . The cold dancers need emotional support so they cling to each other in the center in a big group and kind of just chill while doing a little bit of dancing , but they do nt have enough energy to separate . Occasionally though the hot dancers run into the cluster of cold dancers and knock one or 2 of the cold dancers out of the block , the cold dancers get a little confidence or energy out of this and start to dance a little faster , but they cling on to some of the hot dancers , effectively slowing down the hot dancers , but speeding up the cold dancers . After a while enough hot dancers have collided with cold dancers , that we no longer have hot or cold dancers , just the entire dance floor filled with warm dancers . The energy of the dance floor has reached an equilibrium . So now that the analogy is out of the way . Temperature is a measure of kinetic and internal energy of molecules , molecules with higher energy ( moving around faster ) transfer that energy mainly by colliding with other molecules and passing that energy on to the less energetic molecules , while losing whatever energy they passed on , until everything is the same energy .

If the computer is accessing something at the instant it loses power then you may find that certain files do n't work when you turn it on again . If it 's rewriting your registry or something , it can screw things up quite badly , even if most of the time it wo n't be a problem ."", 'The computer does many things when you shut down . This post is going to cover as many as I can think of . One of the simplest and most important has to do with memory . The computer has to insure that anything that needs to be written to disk , is written to disk . If you do n\'t do this , you could end up with corrupt or invalid files . If you want more detail than that , you \'re going to have to take a few years of computer science at a college level . Your computer also runs some updates that can not be run during operation , either because they directly involve the kernal , or a critical part of run time operations . Usually if your PC is taking forever to shut down , it \'s because these updates either a ) take long or b ) have messed up . Sometimes this can cause your PC to hang during shutdown . Another thing your computer is doing is prepping itself for the next boot cycle . People like operating systems that can start really fast . So a way to get a computer to do this is to prepare a boot sector with information about what your computer tends to do on boot . Often the changes here are small ones . Information about what was used , how it was used , and what problems occurred are stored here . Like I started to say with the last point , flags are set depending on problems your computer might have had during its last runtime . If you notice windows always has to "" un - set "" a flag that tells the PC to run chkdsk ( check disk ) on boot . This is because if your computer experiences a hard shutdown , you might have invalid files on disk . So your computer has to run the check disk operation . This flag is set to true on boot , and during a proper shutdown is set to false . There are many such flags . If you have a RAID array , a proper shutdown is very important . RAID arrays , especially ones that require parity calculations ( i.e. RAID 5 ) write to disk very slowly . To compensate for this DMA , or Direct Memory Access , is heavily utilized . This is n\'t the only time when DMA is used , but it is much greater than other instances . So when you copy a file onto your RAID 5 array , it does n\'t directly move into the RAID array . Instead it is moved into system RAM , or a RAM module on your RAID chipset . Once it has been moved here , the RAID Chipset microprocessor will begin to move it to disk , performing the parity calculations for each individual bit . Even though the file has appeared to the user as being moved , it might not actually be valid on the disk yet . ( Same explanation for the first point ) When you do a regular shutdown of the PC , the computer will wait for the parity calculations to complete . If you perform a hard shutdown , the RAM will loose power and all the data that was still being moved to the RAID array will be lost . You \'ll often notice that expensive RAID cards ( i.e. Intel ) will come with an optional battery to keep the on - board RAM module powered in case of a hard shutdown . Your every - day home computer does n\'t have this battery , and if you force a shutdown you \'ll loose the data . Your computer will not shut down until all processes have terminated , and given their termination codes . Basically telling the OS that they have terminated with such and such final state . This is why sometimes your computer wo n\'t shut down until you \'ve saved a document , or answered a prompt . A soft shutdown has a lower interrupt priority than some of these prompts . So the processes will wait until these prompts have been answered , before tending to the interrupt from the OS . The last things I can think of are all small housecleaning tasks . Update the registry , change values in whatever system records system is being used . That \'s pretty much all I can think of . tl;dr The majority of what it \'s waiting for is memory to be validated , and updates . EDIT : I \'m clearing up some cases where the word "" memory "" is ambiguous . Specifically memory refers to the address space of a computer , which has boiled down to RAM . But it can be widely generalized as any data on a computer . One has to remember that a CPU does not understand the difference between memory on RAM , and memory on the hard drive .

Every pair of the form a / b will turn into a number that is either finite ( ends in ... [ 0 ] ) or has a repeating chunk at the end . So there is an exact equivalency between all of the numbers with repeating stuff ( including repeating [ 0 ] ) and pairs of integers . Any repeating - number thing can be turned into a / b , and any a / b will turn into a repeating - number thing . Step 2 . Now , the fun stuff . There is at least one number that CANNOT BE TURNED INTO A PAIR OF INTEGERS . That is , IT WILL NEVER HAVE REPEATING STUFF AT THE END ! ! ! This is a simplification of Cantor \'s Diagonal argument . This is a proof generated by Georg Cantor in the late 1800s to demonstrate that there are different orders of infinity . And that the set of rationals ( all numbers of the form a / b ) is infinite , but the set of all reals ( add in pi and e and other fun numbers ) is a larger infinite . Make a huge grid . Label each row with an integer . Label each column with an integer . Now put the value a / b in each cell where a is the row and b is the column . ( Note that b must be > 0 . ) Now trace a line through all of the cells . Go ( using Excel notation ) A1 , B1 , A2 , A3 , B2 , C1 , D1 , C2 , B3 , A4 , A5 , B4 , C3 , D2 , E1 , ... You \'ve just produced an ordering of EVERY number of the form a / b. Now we \'re going to build a NEW number Q. Start with "" 0 . "" to lead off our new number ( Q ) . Now go along that line . We \'ll get the first digit of Q ( the tenths ) by picking a number that is different from the first digit of the first number on the line . We \'ll get the second digit of Q by picking a number that is different from the second digit of the second number on the line . And so on and so on . When we \'re done ( conceptually since there are an infinite number of digits in Q ) , we \'ve built a number that is different from EVERY number on the line ! That \'s right , if you say , "" hey it is the same as the 103,232nd number on the line "" , I will say "" no , because the 103,232th digit of Q is different from the 103,232th digit on of whatever was on the line .

Unfortunately , the proof that pi is irrational is probably way to complicated to ELI5 . It was n't proven until the 1700s , which is testament to how complex it is . [ Here 's ] ( URL_1 ) a list of proofs . If a number is irrational , that means its decimal expansion never falls into a recursive pattern ."", '[ Here ] ( URL_0 ) is a simple proof that pi is irrational . All it requires is basic calculus . The idea is as follows : Assume that pi = A / B is a rational number . Then we can construct a function of the form f(x ) = x^(n ) ( A - Bx)^(n)/n ! , where n is any positive integer . To get a feel for what a function like this looks like , see [ this ] ( URL_1 ) , where it is done for 22/7 , rather than pi , and n=3 . In particular , it will pass through x=0 , make a bump and then come back down to pass through the x - axis at x = A / B. So if pi = A / B , then this will make a bump between x=0 and x = pi . Another function that does this is sin(x ) . It passes through x=0 and then makes a bump before passing through x = pi . So if we make the function f(x)sin(x ) , then it will do this too . The interesting thing about f(x)sin(x ) is that the area under the graph from x=0 to x = pi ( so under the bump ) will always be an integer . Intuitively , this is pretty believable because the area under sin(x ) from x=0 to x = pi is 2 , and f(x ) is a polynomial with nice , rational coefficients which interact nicely ( this is explicitly found by applying the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to evaluate the integral ) . So we have a function , f(x)sin(x ) , whose are under its graph between x=0 and x = pi is an integer . But this function passes through the x - axis at x=0 and x = pi and hits its maximum value at x = pi/2 , in the middle . Here sin(pi/2)=1 and f(pi/2 ) = pi^(n)(A - B(A/2B))^(n)/n ! = pi^(n)A^(n)/2^(n)n ! . This means that the total area under the curve is * less * than pi^(n+1)A^(n)/2^(n)n ! . The interesting thing about factorials is that they are , generally , bigger than exponents . This means that , regardless of what A is , we can always choose n to be large enough so that pi^(n+1)A^(n)/2^(n ) < n ! . But then the area , which is a positive integer , is less than pi^(n+1)A^(n)/2^(n)n ! which is less than 1 . There are no positive integers less than 1 , so we must not be able to make the function f(x ) , which means that pi can not be rational .', ""Because we know it because it ca n't be a rational number . ( warning , math ahead ) A rational number is one that can be represented as a ratio of two integers . For any repeating or terminating decimal out there , you can do a little math to express it as a ratio . With a terminating decimal , it is pretty easy : 0.123 = 123/1000 Repeating decimals require a little algebra : n = 0.123123 ... 1000n = 123.123123 ... 1000n - n = 999n = 123 n = 123/999 = 41/333 What does this have to do with pi ? It means that either a ) pi can be expressed as a ratio of two integers , or b ) pi can not be represented as a terminating or repeating decimal . If we can show there is no way to express pi as a ratio , the only remaining possibility is a nonrepeating decimal . In 1761 , this is exactly what Johann Heinrich Lambert did . Unfortunately , his proof , and others like it , require advanced math we 'd rather not get into . Lucky for us , the proof that √2 is irrational is pretty straight forward and demonstrates how one might go about this kind fo proof : assume a and b exist , such that a / b = √2 , and a and b have no common factors a^2 / b^2 = 2 a^2 = 2 * b^2 therefore a is even , and there exists a k such that a = 2k ( 2 * k)^2 = 2 * b^2 4 * k^2 = 2 * b^2 2 * k^2 = b^2 therefore b is also even However , we assumed a and b had no common factors , so they can not both be even .

649,649,"['The Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating , Poisonous or other Gases , and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare , usually called the Geneva Protocol , is a treaty prohibiting the use of chemical and biological weapons in international armed conflicts . It was signed at Geneva on 17 June 1925 and entered into force on 8 February 1928 . It was registered in League of Nations Treaty Series on 7 September 1929 . It prohibits the use of "" asphyxiating , poisonous or other gases , and of all analogous liquids , materials or devices "" and "" bacteriological methods of warfare "" . This is now understood to be a general prohibition on chemical weapons and biological weapons , but has nothing to say about production , storage or transfer . Later treaties did cover these aspects — the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention ( BWC ) and the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention ( CWC ) . A number of countries submitted reservations when becoming parties to the Geneva Protocol , declaring that they only regarded the non - use obligations as applying to other parties and that these obligations would cease to apply if the prohibited weapons were used against them . TL;DR Part of Geneva . Do n\'t have to follow the treaty but its a nice thing to do .

So giving them the plague , or asphyxiating schools , or nuking the whole damn place to hell is generally frowned upon . As well as cruel and unusual deaths by more standard means . For instance , triangular - shaped bayonets were banned because the wound was a bitch to stitch up , and it would inflict a slow , gangrenous death . Now , once enough countries realize that wars should be fought primarily between soldiers , and not soldiers vs. civilians , they got together at Geneva and signed these accords to ban certain weapons . Now , in order to actually enforce these bans , they made it illegal to mass - produce and use these weapons without heavy oversight . If someone does begin mass - production unauthorized , they face severe consequence up to , and including , military intervention from the other signers , i.e. USA vs Iraq ( \' 03 version ) , or Israeli airstrikes in Iran , Syria on chemical weapons factories .

651,651,"['Without the specifics of the contract, as well as the specifics of the country/state/city you\'re moving to, it\'s hard to say what\'s legal.  But this also isn\'t law.se, so I\'ll answer this from the point of view of personal finance, and what you can/should do as next steps. Whenever paying an application fee or a deposit, you need to ensure that you have in writing exactly what you\'re applying for or putting a deposit in for.  Whether this is an apartment, a car, or a loan, before any money changes hands, you need to get in writing exactly what you\'re putting that money to. So for a car, you\'d want to have the complete specifications - make, model, year, color, extra packages, and any relevant loan information if applicable.  You wouldn\'t just hand a dealer $2000 for ""a Toyota Camry"", you\'d make sure it was specified which one, in writing, as well as the total you\'re expecting to pay.  Same for an apartment: you should have, in writing (email is fine) the specific unit you are putting a deposit for, and the specific rate you\'ll be paying, and the length of time the lease is for. This is to avoid a common tactic: bait and switch, which is what it looks like you\'ve run into.  A company puts forth a ""nice"" model, everything looks good, you get far enough in that it seems like you\'re locked in - and then it turns out you\'re really getting a less nice model that\'s not as ideal as whatever you signed up for.  Now if you want to get what you originally signed up for you need to pay extra - presumably ""something was wrong in the original ad"", or something like that.  And all you can hear in the background is Darth Vader... ""I am altering the deal. Pray I don\'t alter it any further."" So; what do you do when you\'ve been bait-and-switched? The best thing to do is typically to walk away. Try to get your application fee back; you may or may not be able to, but it\'s worth a shot, and even if you cannot, walk away anyway. Someone who is going to bait-and-switch on you is probably not going to be a good landlord; my guess is that rent is going to keep going up beyond the level of the market, and you probably can kiss your security deposit goodbye. Second, if walking away isn\'t practical for whatever reason, you can find out what the local laws are. Some locations (though very few, sadly) require advertised prices to be accurate; particularly the fact that they re-advertised the unit again for the same rate suggests they are falling afoul of that. You can ask around, search the internet, or best yet talk to a lawyer who specializes in this sort of thing; some of them will be willing to at least answer a few questions for free (hoping to score your business for an easy, profitable lawsuit). Be aware that it\'s not exactly a good situation to be in, to be suing your landlord; second only to suing your employer, in my opinion, in terms of bad things to do while hoping to continue the relationship.  Find an alternative as soon as you can if you go this route. In the future, pay a lot of attention to detail when making application fees.  Often the application fee is needed before you get into too much detail - but pick a location that has reasonable application fees, and no extras.  For example, in my area, it\'s typical to pay a $25 application fee, nonrefundable, to do the credit check and background check, and a refundable $100-$200 deposit to hold the unit while doing that; a place that asks for a non-refundable deposit is somewhere I\'d simply not apply at all.']",0,real

That is : you ca n\'t both encrypt and decrypt by using the same password ; once you use one of the two possible passwords for encryption , then you can only decrypt by using the other password you did not use for encrypting . This is all the technical basis you need . But why is this technical basis so useful ? If we use intelligently that previous technical stuff , then we can get a nice security system working . This is the trick : you keep one of the two passwords as a secret password only you know and no one else knows ; this is called your "" private key "" . And you let the other password be known by everybody ; this will be your "" public key "" . Thanks to this , you can nicely perform two interesting tasks : a ) You can RECEIVE ( not send ) information in a secure manner : since everybody knows your public key , then they can encrypt any information they want to send to you by using your public key . Since the information has been encrypted by using your public key , then it can only be decrypted by using your private , secret key ; and since you are the only one who knows your own private key , then you are the only person who will be able to decrypt the information that was sent to you . ( If you want to SEND information to other people in a secure manner , then you \'ll have to know those people \'s respective public keys , and use these public keys for encrypting ) . b ) you can SEND information in such manner that you can absolutely prove that information was sent by YOU : if you want to send a certain information and you encrypt it by using your PRIVATE , SECRET key , then everybody will be able to decrypt and read that information , because the information will be decryptable by your public key and everybody knows your public key . So your information is not protected against reading , but , since it is decryptable by your public key , then it is a complete proof that the information was encrypted by your private , secret key . And since you are the only person who knows your own private , secret key , then it gets perfectly proven that the information was encrypted by you and no one else . This is why encrypting by using your own private key is also known as "" digitally signing "" the information you send .

The counting numbers are 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , etc . A prime number is a counting number bigger than 1 whose only factors are 1 and itself . For example , 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 , and 11 are the first primes . For a counterexample , 6 is not a prime because it has factors other than 1 and 6 , namely 2 and 3 . "" Clock math "" only uses the numbers 0 through 23 . If we ever get a number bigger than 23 or less than 0 , we add or subtract 24 to put it into that range . If it \'s 10 o\'clock now , in 20 hours it will be 6 o\'clock , not 30 o\'clock . Now suppose that we use a clock with a prime number of hours , say 5 , instead of 24 hours . ( We can pretend that we \'re on an asteroid whose day is much shorter . ) Then if it \'s not midnight , we can multiply the current hour by itself 4 times --- no matter what it is --- and we \'ll end up at 1 o\'clock : 1 * 1 * 1 * 1 = 1 ^ 4 = 1 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 2 ^ 4 = 16 = 5 * 3 + 1 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3 ^ 4 = 81 = 5 * 20 + 1 4 * 4 * 4 * 4 = 4 ^ 4 = 256 = 5 * 51 + 1 This pattern holds for any prime p : if a number x is not evenly divisible by p , then when we multiply x by itself ( p-1 ) times , the result is 1 more than a multiple of p. Something similar happens when we multiply two prime numbers p and q together to get a number n : if a number x is not evenly divisible by p or q , then when we multiply x by itself ( p-1 ) * ( q-1 ) times , the result is 1 more than a multiple of n , or 1 o\'clock on a clock with n hours . So for example , when p is 5 and q is 7 , we get a clock with 35 hours on it . Pick any hour that is not a multiple of 5 or 7 , like 4 . Now multiply it by itself ( 5 - 1 ) * ( 7 - 1 ) = 24 times .

If I ask you what the factors of 1081 are , you \'ll probably have a little trouble figuring out what they are . It gets a lot harder when the primes get longer : as far as anyone knows , for every three digits I add to the number I give you , the problem gets ten times harder . So you choose two big prime numbers ( a few hundred digits long ) p and q , then multiply them together to get n. Also let f = ( p-1 ) * ( q-1 ) . Pick a random number e and find a number d such that e * d is 1 more than a multiple of f , i.e. e * d = f * k + 1 for some counting number k. You tell the world what n and e are . Since factoring is so hard , I have no way of knowing what your choice of p and q are or what d or f are . Now when I want to send you a message , I turn it into a number M. This is n\'t hard , since computers store everything as numbers anyway . I compute C = M ^ e on a clock with n hours . Then you compute C ^ d = M ^ ( d * e ) But you chose d so that e * d = f * k + 1 : M ^ ( d * e ) = M ^ ( f * k + 1 ) = M ^ ( f * k ) * M^1 = ( M ^ f ) ^ k * M and since M ^ f = M ^ ( ( p-1 ) * ( q-1 ) ) = 1 o\'clock on a clock with n hours ( M ^ f ) ^ k * M = 1 ^ k * M = M and you know what my message is .

662,662,"[""To a certain extent, small cap companies will in general follow the same trends as large cap companies. The extent of this cointegration depends on numerous factors, but a prime reason is the presence of systemic risk, i.e. the risk to the entire market. In simple terms, sthis is the risk that your portfolio will approach asymptotically as you increase its diversification, and it's why hedging is also important.  That being said, small cap businesses will, in general, likely do worse than large cap stocks, for several reasons. This was/is certainly the case in the Great Recession.  Small cap businesses have, on average, higher betas, which is a measure of a company's risk compared to the overall market. This means that small cap companies, on average outperform large cap companies during boom times, but it also means that they suffer more on average during bear times. The debate over whether or not the standard beta is still useful for small cap companies continues, however. Some economists feel that small cap companies are better measured against the Russell 2000 or similar indexes instead of the S&P 500.  Small cap companies may face problems accessing or maintaining access to lines of credit. During the Great Recession, major lenders decreased their lending to small businesses, which might make it harder for them to weather the storm.  On a related point, small businesses might not have as large an asset base to use as collateral for loans in bad times. One notable large cap company that used its asset base to their advantage was Ford, which gave banks partial ownership of its factories during hard times. This a) gave Ford a good amount of cash with which to continue their short-term operations, and b) gave the banks a vested interest in keeping Ford's lines of credit open. Ford struggled, but it never faced the financial problems of GM and Chrysler.  Despite political rhetoric about Main Street vs. Wall Street, small businesses don't receive as much government aid in times of crisis as some large cap companies do. For example, the Small Business Lending Fund, a brilliant but poorly implemented idea in 2010, allocated less than $30 billion to small businesses. (The actual amount loaned was considerably less). Compare that to the amounts loaned out under TARP. Discussions about corporate lobbying power aside, small businesses aren't as crucial to the overall stability of the financial system Small businesses don't always have the manpower to keep up with changes in regulation. When the Dodd-Frank Act passed, large banks (as an example), could hire more staff to understand it and adapt to it relatively easily; small banks, however, don't always have the resources to invest in such efforts.  There are other reasons, some of which are industry-specific, but these are some of the basic ones.  If you want visual confirmation that small cap businesses follow a similar trend, here is a graph of the Russell 2000 and S&P 500 indexes:  Here is a similar graph for the Russell 2000 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average.   If you wanted to confirm this technically and control for the numerous complicated factors (overlap between indexes, systemic risk, seasonal adjustment, etc.), just ask and I'll try to run some numbers on it when I have a chance. Keep in mind, too, that looking at a pretty picture is no substitute for rigorous financial econometrics. A basic start would be to look at the correlation between the indexes, which I calculate as 0.9133 and 0.9526, respectively. As you can see, they're pretty close. Once again, however, the reality is more complicated technically, and a sufficiently detailed analysis is beyond my capabilities. Just a quick side note. These graphs show the logarithm of the values of the indexes, which is a common statistical nuance that is used when comparing time series with radically different magnitudes but similar trends.

Finance, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average data came from Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) Per usual, I try to provide code whenever possible, if I used it.

681,681,"[""A protein is a very complex molecule . It 's structure can be broken down into several levels : - Primary structure At their base level , a protein is a series of amino acids ( themselves smaller molecules ) , which are chained together in a long string . There are many different amino acids , of which about 20 are found in human proteins . The primary structure is the specific sequence of amino acids that go into the protein . - Secondary Structure As you can imagine , a long chain of molecules is n't likely to stay in a long straight line for very long . If you take a long piece of string and dangle it high off the ground , it 's more or less straight . As soon as you let it relax and let go of the string , it puddles on the floor into a complex shape . Proteins behave similarly . Secondary structure is the way that segments of the protein which are immediately adjacent to each other fold themselves . It can be either alpha - helices ( twists ) , or beta - pleated sheets ( zig - zag folds ) . A single protein will transition from alpha to beta and back again many times over its entire length . We can generally recognize from the amino acid sequence which parts are beta sheets and which are alpha helices . - Tertiary structure Once you 've got lengths of helices and pleated sheets , the protein is still mostly a straight line , just with a few folds or twists here and there . It 's still not stable as a whole . Tertiary structure is how disparate lengths of the protein , which may be many hundreds of amino acids apart , come together because of attractions between their component amino acids . This results in the whole superstructure of the protein folding and twisting back on itself so that alpha - helix A lies close to alpha - helix F , and beta - sheet C is adjacent to beta - sheet X , etc . This tertiary folding is the part that Folding@Home is working on . There are myriad ways in which you could fold a protein so that things which go together * are * together , but we have no easy way to work out which is correct . Only one configuration will result in the protein working properly . We generally assume that whichever configuration has the lowest binding energy is most likely to be the correct one . Folding@Home is trying to figure out which configurations need the least energy . - Quarternary Structure This can refer to two things : 1 . Sometimes , after the protein folding is finished , another enzyme comes along and chops bits off , so that the final shape and function is correct . Insulin works like this - it 's tertiary structure looks a bit like a paperclip . The quarternary modification cuts off the rounded ends of the paper clip so that you 're left with some parallel bits . 2 . Some proteins need to be attached to other proteins ( or to copies of the first protein ) in order to function . The resulting superstructure is quarternary structure . Haemoglobin ( that carries oxygen in your blood ) is like this , and is composed of four identical but kind - of separate proteins ( the globin ) , wrapped around another protein that incorporates iron ( the haem ) . Interestingly , a single protein chain might be folded in two different ways to have very different functions . This can either be on purpose , increasing efficiency of genetic coding , or as part of a disease process - amyloidosis and prion diseases are a result of incorrect protein folding ."", ""I could do what everyone else did and explain primary and secondary structure and stuff , but then I realized this was ELI5 , so I 'll be simple .

Now , if you manage to arrange the thread in * just * the right way , you'l have a piece of fabric . Neat ! This piece of fabric is the secondary structure . Now , if we get that fabric , we can connect certain threads in just the right way to create a shirt ! We 'll call that tertiary structure . And finally , we 'll add some pants and a singlet to get a full set of clothes ! And that 's the quaternary structure . So , on the first level , you 're not going to have any bonding whatsoever - just the polypeptide that codes the protein , in a string form . On the second level , though , the polypeptide will interact with itself somewhat to create a 2 - D structure . And on the third level , the polypeptide fabric will interact with itself more strongly to form a three - dimensional structure . And finally , on the fourth level , the protein created will bind with other proteins to create a unique structure !"", ""Proteins are huge molecules that tend to have functions based on their physical shape .

691,691,"[""Stephen William Hawking CH CBE FRS FRSA (8 January 1942\xa0– 14 March 2018) was an English theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and author who, at the time of his death, was director of research at the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology at the University of Cambridge.[17][18] Between 1979 and 2009, he was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge, widely viewed as one of the most prestigious academic posts in the world.[19]\nHawking was born in Oxford into a family of physicians.  In October 1959, at the age of 17, he began his university education at University College, Oxford,  where he received a first-class BA degree in physics. In October 1962, he began his graduate work at Trinity Hall at the University of Cambridge where, in March 1966, he obtained his PhD degree in applied mathematics and theoretical physics, specialising in general relativity and cosmology. In 1963, at age 21, Hawking was diagnosed with an early-onset slow-progressing form of motor neurone disease that gradually, over decades, paralysed him.[20][21] After the loss of his speech, he communicated through a speech-generating device initially through use of a handheld switch, and eventually by using a single cheek muscle.[22]\nHawking's scientific works included a collaboration with Roger Penrose on gravitational singularity theorems in the framework of general relativity, and the theoretical prediction that black holes emit radiation, often called Hawking radiation. Initially, Hawking radiation was controversial. By the late 1970s and following the publication of further research, the discovery was widely accepted as a major breakthrough in theoretical physics. Hawking was the first to set out a theory of cosmology explained by a union of the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. He was a vigorous supporter of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.[23][24]\nHawking achieved commercial success with several works of popular science in which he discussed his theories and cosmology in general. His book A Brief History of Time appeared on the Sunday Times bestseller list for a record-breaking 237 weeks. Hawking was a Fellow of the Royal Society, a lifetime member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, and a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the United States. In 2002, Hawking was ranked number 25 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons. He died in 2018 at the age of 76, after living with motor neurone disease for more than 50 years.""]",0,real

Option 1 : Firm A and firm B both maintain current prices . Profits A = $ 700mil , profits B = $ 700mil . Option 2 : Firm A undercuts firm B by selling the good at a lower price . Firm A 's profits rise . Profits A = $ 900mil , profits B = $ 500mil Option 3 : Firm B undercuts firm A by selling the good at a lower price . Firm B 's profits rise . Profits A = $ 500mil , profits B = $ 900mil Option 4 : Both firm A and firm B cut their prices . Profits fall for both . Profits A = $ 600mil , profits B = $ 600mil . There are many types of GT but this is probably the simplest one . It 's interesting , I think , that in the long run the best option is option 1 but the second both firms choose option 1 then it is in their best interests to choose option 2 or 3 and gain extra profits . Therefore option 1 is an unstable equilibrium ."", ""Another great example that was pointed out to me recently was the penalty shootout in Football ( Soccer ) . In a game which has to produce a result , like the World Cup Final , if the scores are tied after full time and extra time , a Penalty Shootout is held ; five players , one at a time , step up and place the ball on a spot 11 m ( 12 yards ) from the goal , run up and shoot , with the goalkeeper trying to save it . Now , part of this is a contest of skill between the two players , but a lot of it has to do with game theory . If the goalkeeper knows that the striker usually shoots to his left , he knows which way to dive . * But * , the striker probably knows that the goalie has done his homework . So he can shoot left , which the goalkeeper will expect , or right , which he wo n't . But the goalie knows that 's his choice too , and might therefore dive to the unexpected side - but the striker might double - bluff and choose to shoot left ... you get the idea . What it boils down to is that what the striker does depends on what the goalkeeper is going to do . And what the goalkeeper does depends on what the striker is going to do . A good example is [ this shootout ] ( URL_0 ) , from the 2008 Champions ' League final in Moscow . The shooutout begins at about 2.25 in . The Chelsea players ( in blue ) have been advised that the Man Utd goalkeeper , Edwin van der Sar , usually dives to the player 's weaker side , so they should shoot to the stronger side which , for the first four of them happens to be to their right - van der Sar 's left . Meanwhile , the Chelsea keeper , Petr Cech , knows that when Cristiano Ronaldo ( red number 7 ) pauses in his run - up , he usually then shoots to his left . Lo and behold , this is exactly what happens ; Chelsea players shoot to the right and van der Sar dives the wrong way and they score . Ronaldo stops in his run - up , then shoots left and Cech saves it . Ashley Cole ( blue number 3 ) , disobeys his team 's advice and shoots the way that van der Sar is expecting him to - the right . Luckily , he hits it well and the goalkeeper ca n't quite reach it . By the time the final Chelsea player - Anelka , number 39 - comes up to take his kick , van der Sar thinks that he 's figured out that everyone 's just shooting to his left . So he points to that side as Anelka steps up . This panics Anelka into changing his shot at the last moment ( as he thought it would ) and he dives to his right and saves it ."", 'Game theory is , fundamentally , the study of decision making . In particular , it \'s the study of how you and I can make decisions ( perhaps without communicating ) to achieve the "" best "" results ( by some measure ) . A classic example is the [ Prisoner \'s dilemma ] ( URL_0 ) that deals with situations where ( a ) I \'m always better off screwing you over but ( b ) we both benefit more by not screwing each other over . In practice , this occurs all the time : for example , you \'d save yourself some trouble by throwing trash on the sidewalk , but * collectively * we \'re all better off if we all do n\'t .']",0,real
715,715,"['Hilary Whitehall Putnam (/ˈpʌtnəm/; July 31, 1926 – March 13, 2016) was an American philosopher, mathematician, and computer scientist, and a major figure in analytic philosophy in the second half of the 20th century. He made significant contributions to philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, philosophy of mathematics, and philosophy of science. Outside philosophy, Putnam contributed to mathematics and computer science. Together with Martin Davis he developed the Davis–Putnam algorithm for the Boolean satisfiability problem and he helped demonstrate the unsolvability of Hilbert\'s tenth problem.\nPutnam was known for his willingness to apply equal scrutiny to his own philosophical positions as to those of others, subjecting each position to rigorous analysis until he exposed its flaws. As a result, he acquired a reputation for frequently changing his positions. In philosophy of mind, Putnam is known for his argument against the type-identity of mental and physical states based on his hypothesis of the multiple realizability of the mental, and for the concept of functionalism, an influential theory regarding the mind–body problem.[10] In philosophy of language, along with Saul Kripke and others, he developed the causal theory of reference, and formulated an original theory of meaning, introducing the notion of semantic externalism based on a thought experiment called Twin Earth.[11]\nIn philosophy of mathematics, Putnam and W. V. O. Quine developed the Quine–Putnam indispensability argument, an argument for the reality of mathematical entities,[12] later espousing the view that mathematics is not purely logical, but ""quasi-empirical"".[13] In epistemology, Putnam is known for his critique of the well-known ""brain in a vat"" thought experiment. This thought experiment appears to provide a powerful argument for epistemological skepticism, but Putnam challenges its coherence.[14] In metaphysics, he originally espoused a position called metaphysical realism, but eventually became one of its most outspoken critics, first adopting a view he called ""internal realism"",[15] which he later abandoned. Despite these changes of view, throughout his career Putnam remained committed to scientific realism, roughly the view that mature scientific theories are approximately true descriptions of ways things are.[16]\nIn his later work, Putnam became increasingly interested in American pragmatism, Jewish philosophy, and ethics, engaging with a wider array of philosophical traditions. He also displayed an interest in metaphilosophy, seeking to ""renew philosophy"" from what he identified as narrow and inflated concerns.[17] He was at times a politically controversial figure, especially for his involvement with the Progressive Labor Party in the late 1960s and early 1970s.[18]']",0,real
716,716,"['Speaking a language is n\'t just a matter of learning words ; you have to learn the whole grammar , because different languages have completely different grammars . German is a great language to explain this . Here \'s a German sentence and its English translation : 1939 brach der Krieg aus . War broke out in 1939 . Notice where "" 1939 "" comes ? You see , if you were learning German and had n\'t had much practice , you might be able to understand the sentence easily if you heard it or read it ; but actually being able to produce the sentence correctly means having to resist the temptation to put everything in English grammar , and instead turning the sentence around . And that \'s basically the reason . Anyone learning a language has a "" passive knowledge "" , which is what they understand , and an "" active knowledge "" , which is what they can actually say ; and their passive knowledge is always much greater than their active knowledge . The same is true when you \'re trying to remember translations of individual words . You might hear a German say "" Brief "" and be able to think , "" Oh yes , I recognise that word : it means \' letter \' , "" especially if the sentence also contains a word like "" schreiben "" ( "" write "" ) . But the other way around , trying to remember the foreign word , is much more difficult ( and is it masculine , feminine or neuter ? ) . Or you might see the word "" Briefwechsel "" and think : "" Oh yeah , I know \' Brief \' means \' letter \' , and \' Wechsel \' I \'ve often seen at currency exchanges ; so if \' Wechsel \' means \' exchange \' , then \' Briefwechsel \' must mean \' exchange of letters \' , so \' correspondance \' . "" And you \'d be right . But if it was the other way around , and you had to translate "" correspondance "" into German , you \'d need a dictionary .', 'Some possibilities : 1 ) You may be able to recognise words without knowing the grammar , or , if you have a grasp of the language , be able to infer the meaning of words you do n\'t know . If you only know "" bonjour "" in French , you \'ll probably still understand what "" Bonjour la classe "" means when a teacher uses it , because French "" classe "" sounds pretty close to English "" class "" . If you only know the present tense in Italian , and an Italian uses the word * ieri * ( "" yesterday "" ) at the beginning of a sentence , you will probably still be able to recognise some verbs even though they are in the past tense because they will have the same beginnings but just different endings : "" oggi , mangio della pasta e bevo del vino "" ( "" today , I eat pasta and drink wine "" ) - > "" ieri , ho mangiato della pasta e ho bevuto del vino "" . If a German says to you , in German , "" today I will be catching the * Flugzeug * to Paris "" and you do n\'t know the word * Flugzeug * , you can infer it means "" plane "" from the context of the sentence . However , because you do n\'t know the words you do n\'t know ( obviously ) , you are n\'t able to use them yourself unless you are able to pick them up . 2 ) Alternatively , you may know the language but lack confidence or fluency when speaking it , or may have difficulty remembering and applying grammatical rules .', 'Often this is actually the first phase of learning a language ; you tend to pick up on things and understand them before you can recreate them yourself .

Most theories in classical physics can be derived from quantum mechanics as an approximation valid at large (macroscopic) scale.\nQuantum mechanics differs from classical physics in that energy, momentum, angular momentum, and other quantities of a bound system are restricted to discrete values (quantization); objects have characteristics of both particles and waves (wave–particle duality); and there are limits to how accurately the value of a physical quantity can be predicted prior to its measurement, given a complete set of initial conditions (the uncertainty principle).\nQuantum mechanics arose gradually from theories to explain observations which could not be reconciled with classical physics, such as Max Planck\'s solution in 1900 to the black-body radiation problem, and the correspondence between energy and frequency in Albert Einstein\'s 1905 paper which explained the photoelectric effect. These early attempts to understand microscopic phenomena, now known as the ""old quantum theory"", led to the full development of quantum mechanics in the mid-1920s by Niels Bohr, Erwin Schrödinger, Werner Heisenberg, Max Born, Paul Dirac and others. The modern theory is formulated in various specially developed mathematical formalisms.

CUPERTINO, California — February 11, 2005 — Apple® announced today that its Board of Directors has approved a two-for-one split of the Company’s common stock and a proportional increase in the number of Apple common shares authorized from 900 million to 1.8 billion. Each shareholder of record at the close of business on February 18, 2005 will receive one additional share for every outstanding share held on the record date, and trading will begin on a split-adjusted basis on February 28, 2005. ...one month after announcing earnings. CUPERTINO, California—January 12, 2005—Apple® today announced financial results for its fiscal 2005 first quarter ended December 25, 2004. For the quarter, the Company posted a net profit of $295 million, or $.70 per diluted share. These results compare to a net profit of $63 million, or $.17 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue for the quarter was $3.49 billion, up 74 percent from the year-ago quarter. Gross margin was 28.5 percent, up from 26.7 percent in the year-ago quarter. International sales accounted for 41 percent of the quarter’s revenue. I wouldn\'t expect Apple to offer another split, as it\'s become somewhat fashionable among tech companies to have high stock prices (see GOOG or NFLX or even BRK-A/BRK-B).  Additionally, as a split does nothing to the underlying value of the company, it shouldn\'t affect your decision to purchase AAPL.  (That said, it may change the perception of a stock as ""cheap"" or ""expensive"" per human psychology). So, to answer your question: companies will usually announce a stock split after releasing their financial results for the preceding fiscal year. Regardless of results, though, splits happen when the board decides it is advantageous to the company to split its stocks.']",0,real

735,735,"[""I can't address the psychology of trust involved in your question, but here are some common sense guidelines for dealing with your issue. Make sure you know who you are talking to.  Call the company you need to speak to via a publicly available phone number. An email or something you got in a letter might be from a different source.  If you use a website, you should be sure you are on the correct website. Keep careful records.  Make good notes of each phone call and keep all emails and letters forever. Note the time, name and/or ID of the person you spoke to and numbers called in addition to keeping notes on what actions should be done.  Keep your faxing transmission receipts and shipping tracking numbers too. If you are nervous, ask them why they want the info.  The fraud department should be able to explain it to you.  For example, they probably want your social because that is how your credit report is identified.  If they are going to fix a credit report, they will need a social.  It is doubtful they would have a good explanation why they need your mother's maiden name. Ask for secure transmission, or confirm they have it.  Postal mail isn't so secure, but I'll go out on a limb and say most fax machines today are not really fax machines, but software that deals in PDFs.  At some point you will have to realize you will have to transmit something.  No method is perfect, but you can limit your exposure. Help them do their jobs.  If you are (understandably) nervous, consider their motivations: corporate profit.  BUT that could very well mean not running afoul of the law and (with any luck) treating customers the best way they know to earn business.  If you stymy the fraud department, how can they help you? If the ID theft was serious enough, document your issue for future law enforcement so you getting pulled over for speeding doesn't result in you going to jail for whatever crime the other person did.  Perhaps the fraud department you are dealing with can assist there. Finally, while you work with fraud departments to clear up your name and account, work on the other end to limit future damage.  Freeze your credit.  See if you bank or credit card have monitoring.  Use CreditKarma.com or a similar if you cannot find a free service.  (Please don't ever pay for credit monitoring.)""]",0,real

741,741,"['To understand this a brief history of liberalism and conservatism is needed . Liberals emerged in opposition to the European monarchies and favored individual liberty . As liberalism evolved , they became divided on how to best pursue liberty . Initially , liberals generally sought freedom from government coercion . Other liberals argued that the least well - off needed to be helped by the state to truly obtain liberty . The division is basically between how much the government should intervene into the economy with classical liberals on the more free market side and social liberals on the more state - welfare side . Due to this history , a lot of European "" liberal "" parties are rather centrist . The US is strange because the libertarians and conservatives ( pre - Trump ) were actually pretty close to classical liberals . The social liberals are more like the moderate Democrats . Plus , the far left parties in Europe have strong communist and socialist influences that are absent in the US . Also , the conservative parties were the "" Church and State "" people that defended the monarchies . The US also did n\'t have that same dynamic . And of course , the US always has to be unique so we call anyone on the left "" liberals "" and those on the right are conservative . So the Aussies probably have things labeled correctly and it \'s the US that \'s making things difficult . Related - The right and the left is not the same in every country . For instance a labor party might be center - right in country A , but center - left in another country B even if they have the same positions because country A and B are ideologically different as a whole .', 'It is the use of the term "" liberal "" in the sense of "" classical liberal "" , which is something closer to "" libertarian "" . The US uses the word "" liberal "" in the sense of "" social liberalism "" , which basically means "" left - wing "" . The other senses of meaning of the word liberal seem to have been lost over there . The modern Australian Liberal Party came about in the mid 1940s after a series of previous different conservative parties had fallen over . It was called \' Liberal \' basically for two reasons . Partly it was to sort of honour the former \' Liberal Party \' of the 1900s , which was the first major conservative party in independent Australia . And partly it was due to the circumstances of the time : Immediately post - war , the ruling Labor party was trying to use Post - War Reconstruction to pursue a range of Socialist , Big Government policies such as nationalising the banks . The conservatives positioned themselves as "" Liberals "" in the libertarian sense of being opposed to this sort of government interference in private enterprise . Which of course , is a fairly typical conservative position . So while it might look funny to Americans , there is no ideological inconsistency in the use of the word Liberal . As with other countries , the ideology of both major parties has hardened over time , so the Liberal Party is more explicitly "" conservative "" and "" right - wing "" these days . You occasionally see people on both the Right ( enthusiastically ) and Left ( pejoratively ) proposing the party be renamed to The Conservative Party as in the UK .', ""Good question . Technically in terms of ideology they SHOULD be the same . If you look in any Poli - Sci text book it 'll tell you that the number one plank of liberalism is a belief in the supremacy of the individual , and the freedom of said individual to live their life as they choose , so long as they do n't interfere with the freedom of anyone else . You may have heard the expression ' laisez - faire ' . That is essentially what that means . But , as you 've probably realised the real world rarely sits neatly with what text books say . In Australia at least the Liberal Party , while including people people who identify as liberal in the sense described above , it also contains people who identify as conservative . They tend to drag the party toward the right on the political spectrum . Also , left and right are relative terms . The alternative party in Australia is the Labor Party . The labor party is the political arm of the union movement and is more interested in collective rights over the individual . While there are ' liberals ' in the labor party , and in terms of social policy there are similarities with liberals in the US , the labor party also includes people that identify as socialist or even communist .

748,748,"[""So far we have a case for yes and no.  I believe the correct answer is... maybe. You mention that most of your expenses are in dollars which is definitely correct, but there is an important complication that I will try to simplify greatly here.  Many of the goods you buy are priced on the international market (a good example is oil) or are made from combinations of these goods.  When the dollar is strong the price of oil is low but when the dollar is weak the price of oil is high. However, when you buy stuff like services (think a back massage) then you pay the person in dollars and the person you are paying just wants dollars so the strength of the dollar doesn't really matter. Most people's expenses are a mix of things that are priced internationally and locally with a bias toward local expenses.  If they also have a mix of investments some of which are international and depend on the strength of the dollar and some are domestic and do not, then they don't have to worry much about the strength/weakness of the dollar later when they sell their investments and buy what they want.  If the dollar is weak than the international goods will be more expensive, but at the same time international part of their portfolio will be worth more. If you plan on retiring in a different country or have 100% of your investments in emerging market stocks than it is worth thinking about either currency hedging or changing your investment mix.  However, for many people a good mix of domestic and international investments covers much of the risk that their currency will weaken while offering the benefits of diversification.  The best part is you don't need to guess if the dollar will get stronger or weaker. tl;dr: If you want your portfolio to not depend on currency moves then hedge.  If you want your retirement to not depend on currency moves then have a good mix of local and unhedged international investments.""]",0,real

759,759,"['While the other people have tried to answer your question as thoroughly as possible, I fear they are entirely incorrect in answering your question itself as it stands. The answer is that there are no usual terms. There are a handful of different options coming out now for this exact scheme. Examples include the UK Governments ""Help To Buy"" scheme. Accomodation is offered at a normal rate, and a small portion of the rent is set aside each month. At the end of a fixed period, that money becomes a deposit which the letter hands over to a mortgage provider who accepts it as a deposit. This might well be a terminology thing, since the other scenario which people described falls into the same name you\'ve used. That scenario is where the investor who owns the property is considering sale of the property, and is happy to negotiate a price up front for the next year. Usually the rent and price is higher than the market rate because if the market goes well over the next year they could end up out of pocket. Putting that into perspective, over that year they are gaining their $1,000 a month or so, but having $100,000 invested means a return of 12%. If the property value is over $250,000 which I believe to be more likely, they are achieving a return of (I think) 4.8%. That\'s not a bad rate, by any means, but realistically they are losing a bit more for maintenance, and they could be making more from their money. If the market were to go up in that time by more than 4.8% (my house, for instance, increased in value by over 15% in the last 12 months), they are making a substantial loss since you are getting a house at 15% below the market rate. The total works out to a 10.2% loss for them. Note that I don\'t know the US housing market at all, I\'m speaking mostly from my experience of the market here in the UK. This is what I hear, what I see, and what I\'ve played. To summarise a bit: Make sure you check your terms before signing anything.']",0,real

"" Latter - Day "" means they live now , long after Jesus was alive . "" Saints "" because they try to be holy people . Mormons are Latter - Day Saints . \\2 . They believe that a man named Joseph Smith was visited by the spirit of a prophet named Moroni , who led him to a field where a holy text had been buried a long , long time ago . It was written on gold plates , so it could last for thousands of years . 2a . That holy text was the Book of Mormon , which is like a third section of the Bible . The Old Testament tells the story of the Jewish people - the 12 tribes of Israel - from the creation of the Earth to the time when they were released from being slaves in Babylon . They believe in obeying God \'s law and generally being good to people . The New Testament tells the story of Jesus , a Jewish preacher who was executed by the Romans about 2,000 years ago and who , his followers say , came back to life after three days . He preached that people should be good to each other and that once we love God , we do n\'t have to worry about dying . The Book of Mormon ( which is the name of another prophet ) tells the story of prophets of God who lived in America , not Israel or Egypt or Babylon . They came to America a long , long time ago . \\3 . Some parts of the Book of Mormon help explain the other parts of the Bible by clarifying what God meant by some mysterious visions and filling in parts of history that the Bible does n\'t include . At least that \'s what Mormons believe . Other people are n\'t so sure that , for instance , ancient people from Israel could have traveled halfway across the world to settle North America . And some Christians do n\'t agree with the idea that Jesus was alive in a "" spirit body "" before he was born 2,000 years ago , and was also visiting America in his spirit body after his death . 3a . Mormons also say the Book of Mormon is , in some ways , better than the Bible because the Bible consists of lots of different books written over many thousands of years by dozens of different people and translated hundreds of different ways . The Book of Mormon was only translated by one person - Joseph Smith - who , they say , was directly inspired by God . \\4 . Mormons , when the religion was first started , were often persecuted by people who thought they were strange and that their beliefs were wrong and damaging to "" proper "" religions like Christianity . ( And the Mormons also told Christians * they * were doing things wrong , which put * their * souls in danger . This made lots of people angry . ) Because the Mormons were trying to live like the saints and prophets of ancient times , they did some things differently - and the most dramatic thing was that they allowed one husband to marry several different wives , just like the patriarchs did in the Old Testament . But having more than one wife is against the law in America , and now the Mormon Church agrees that following the law is more important than having many wives . There was never a rule that a husband had to have lots of wives . 4a . Probably because so much of the Bible takes place with desert - dwelling people - and contains so many prophecies about things rising from dust or the desert springing to life - the first Mormons traveled from places like upstate New York ( where Joseph Smith was from ) and Nauvoo , Illinois ( where they lived for a while until Joseph Smith was killed by an angry mob ) all the way to the Utah territory , which was unsettled land\\ * that was very dry and very hard to live in . \\**although the territory was name for the Ute tribe , who , according to the Book of Mormon , were probably descended from lost Israelites . They were living there before the first Mormons pushed their wheelbarrows into the desert . * 4b . They were led to the shores of the Great Salt Lake by Brigham Young , who said God was leading him to the place where they could start a new promised land . That \'s why Salt Lake City is the capital of Utah and the place where the main church - the Mormon Tabernacle - is located .

763,763,"['To understand this , you have to understand what exactly a seizure is . Not all seizures are the "" shaking uncontrollably and wetting yourself "" type ( grand mal ) that you see in movies and tv shows . Seizures are characterized by aberrant , synchronous neuronal activity in the brain and the outward symptoms can range from a momentary loss of time all the way up to muscular convulsions . The best analogy I can think of for an ELI5 level is that part of the brain gets stuck in a feedback loop that grows with each cycle in a chain - reaction . Sometimes these \' feedback loops \' have a trigger , such as flashing lights or certain musical tones , but many times there is no identifiable trigger . We do know that seizures are more common in people who have a lower excitation threshold in their brain ( if you want to know more about excitation thresholds , feel free to message me but the concept is a bit too complex for ELI5 ) . If a normal person looks at a flashing light they might end up with a headache , while someone with a seizure disorder may experience a seizure . Again , the seizure may be something as subtle as the person staring off into space for a few moments and not realizing the lost time . Basically the brain has to respond to stimuli , and sometimes due to brain chemistry the stimuli causes synchronized activity ( like constructive interference with waves ) that overwhelms the normal dampening mechanisms the brain has in place which results in seizure activity .', 'ITT : Very elaborately worded variations on "" We do n\'t really know "" .

What triggers it could be any kind of stimulus ( flashing lights , certain sounds , etc . ) depending on where the epileptic locus ( the seizure starting point ) is in the brain of the person . You can think of it as a sort of intense mic feedback that only happens when the mic is at a certain distance and volume from the sound system . For those with flashing - light - induced seizures ( epileptic loci in the visual areas of the brain ) , light flashing at a sufficient frequency / intensity is essentially the mic that is at the right distance and volume to cause their particular kind of mic feedback to trigger .

It is the prosecution 's responsibility to prove ( by court standards ) that you are guilty . So why should it be okay for you to be forced to help them ? The idea that you are required to help someone else prove your guilt is already a justification for that part of the 5th amendment . Here are some other reasons why it is fundamentally not fair to force someone to testify against themselves : 1 . Part of any criminal case is a popularity contest . At the end of the day a judge and/or jury needs to be convinced of certain facts . We would all hope that the true facts would be the main criteria for judgment , but some amount of charisma can influence a case .

Again , we 're talking about forcing someone to testify against themselves . It would be unfair to put someone in that position . 2 . Judges and Jury 's are sadly not unbiased .

Or testifying would require you to reveal that your father is black and the jury is a bunch of racists . Again , since it 's the prosecution 's responsibility to prove your guilt ( to court standards ) , the idea that you should be forced to help them turn the judge or jury against you is inherently unfair . 3 . Probably most importantly is what history taught the people who started this country . Without the 5th amendment you can be forced to testify against yourself . Governments through history have used that to coerce people into admitting to crimes they did n't commit .

830,830,"['You can certainly try to do this, but it\'s risky and very expensive. Consider a simplified example. You buy 1000 shares of ABC at $1.00 each, with the intention of selling them all when the price reaches $1.01. Rinse and repeat, right? You might think the example above will net you a tidy $10 profit. But you have to factor in trade commissions. Most brokerages are going to charge you per trade. Fidelity for example, want $4.95 per trade; that\'s for both the buying and the selling. So your 1000 shares actually cost you $1004.95, and then when you sell them for $1.01 each, they take their $4.95 fee again, leaving you with a measly $1.10 in profit. Meanwhile, your entire $1000 stake was at risk of never making ANY profit - you may have been unlucky enough to buy at the stock\'s peak price before a slow (or even fast) decline towards eventual bankruptcy.  The other problem with this is that you need a stock that is both stable and volatile at the same time. You need the volatility to ensure the price keeps swinging between your buy and sell thresholds, over and over again. You need stability to ensure it doesn\'t move well away from those thresholds altogether. If it doesn\'t have this weird stable-volatility thing, then you are shooting yourself in the foot by not holding the stock for longer: why sell for $1.01 if it goes up to $1.10 ten minutes later? Why buy for $1.00 when it keeps dropping to $0.95 ten minutes later? Your strategy means you are always taking the smallest possible profit, for the same amount of risk. Another method might be to only trade each stock once, and hope that you never pick a loser. Perhaps look for something that has been steadily climbing in price, buy, make your tiny profit, then move on to the next company. However you still have the risk of buying something at it\'s peak price and being in for an awfully long wait before you can cash out (if ever). And if all that wasn\'t enough to put you off, brokerages have special rules for ""frequent traders"" that just make it all the more complicated. Not worth the hassle IMO.']",0,real
831,831,"[""So My question is. Is my credit score going to be hit?  Yes it will affect your credit.  Not as much as missing payments on the debt, which remains even if the credit line is closed, and not as much as missing payments on other bills...   If so what can I do about it?  Not very much.  Nothing worth the time it would take.  Like you mentioned, reopening the account or opening another would likely require a credit check and the inquiry will add another negative factor.   In this situation, consider the impact on your credit as fact and the best way to correct it is to move forward and pay all your bills on time.  This is the number one key to improving credit score.   So, right now, the key task is finding a new job. This will enable you to make all payments on time.  If you pay on time and do not overspend, your credit score will be fine. Can I contact the creditors to appeal the decision and get them to not affect my score at the very least? I know they won't restore the account without another credit check). Is there anything that can be done directly with the credit score companies? Depending on how they characterize the closing of the account, it may be mostly a neutral event that has a negative impact than a negative event.  By negative events, I'm referring to bankruptcy, charge offs, and collections.  So the best way to recover is to keep credit utilization below 30% and pay all your bills and debt payments on time. (You seem to be asking how to replace this line of credit to help you through your unemployment.) As for the missing credit line and your current finances, you have to find a way forward.  Opening new credit account while you're not employed is going to be very difficult, if not impossible.  You might find yourself in a situation where you need to take whatever part time gig you can find in order to make ends meet until your job search is complete.  Grocery store, fast food, wait staff, delivery driver, etc. And once you get past this period of unemployment, you'll need to catch up on all bills, then you'll want to build your emergency fund.  You don't mention one, but eating, paying rent/mortgage, keeping current on bills, and paying debt payments are the reasons behind the emergency fund, and the reason you need it in a liquid account.   Source:  I'm a veteran of decades of bad choices when it comes to money, of being unemployed for periods of time, of overusing credit cards, and generally being irresponsible with my income and savings.  I've done all those things and am now paying the price.  In order to rebuild my credit, and provide for my retirement, I'm having to work very hard to save.  My focus being financial health, not credit score, I've brought my bottom line from approximately 25k in the red up to about 5k in the red.  The first step was getting my payments under control.   I have also been watching my credit score.  Two years of on time mortgage payments, gradual growth of score.  Paid off student loans, uptick in score.  Opened new credit card with 0% intro rate to consolidate a couple of store line of credit accounts.  Transferred those balances.  Big uptick.  Next month when utilization on that card hits 90%, downtick that took back a year's worth of gains.  However, financially, I'm not losing 50-100 a month to interest. TLDR; At certain times, you have to ignore the credit score and focus on the important things.  This is one of those times for you.  Find a job.  Get back on your feet.

Light can be seen behaving as photons in experiments such as photoelectric effect in which a certain quantum of energy is required to expel a single photon of a specific energy . So light is both wave like and particle like , but in the end nobody knows exactly what it is , only that both wave and particle models can help explain it ."", 'Okay , so photons are the most simple way we can describe electromagnetic radiation ( which includes radio waves , infrared , visible light , ultraviolet light , x - rays , and gamma rays ) - you can think of a photon of being something that a contains energy that can not be divided up any further . This is often stated as a photon being the * quantum * of light . They carry the force for electromagnetism ( the interactions between charged particles ) and this force can be seen on both microscopic and macroscopic levels . A photon is also a type of particle called a boson , meaning that it does not have to obey the Pauli exclusion principal like things like electrons , protons , and neutrons , which are fermions . Photons are uncharged , and they have a rest mass of 0 , which allows them to travel long distances between interactions with other particles , which is made possible because they have a non - zero momentum . Photons display behaviors of both particles and waves . They \'re wavelike in the sense that they act as a disturbance / oscillation that travels through space with frequencies , wavelengths and amplitudes , and particle - like because you can think of them as objects when they bounce around and interact with other particles like electrons . The frequencies and wavelengths determine what "" color "" they \'ll be in regards to visible light , and otherwise where on the electromagnetic spectrum they lie . Low frequencies with long wavelengths are things like radio waves and infrared radiation , while x - rays and gamma rays have high frequencies and short wavelengths . Red light is lower frequency , violet light is higher frequency . They \'re emitted by processes like electrons in atoms dropping down from higher energy levels back down to their ground state , when matter and antimatter annihilates with each other , when charged particles are accelerated ( called synchrotron radiation ) , radioactive decay , and nuclear fusion . Their emission during these processes helps keep mass - energy conservation in check . Photons are stable , having what can be thought of as an infinite lifespan .

He was a mathematics professor at the University of Jena, and is understood by many to be the father of analytic philosophy, concentrating on the philosophy of language, logic, and mathematics. Though he was largely ignored during his lifetime, Giuseppe Peano (1858–1932), Bertrand Russell (1872–1970), and, to some extent, Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889–1951) introduced his work to later generations of philosophers. Frege is widely considered to be the greatest logician since Aristotle, and one of the most profound philosophers of mathematics ever.[16]\nHis contributions include the development of modern logic in the Begriffsschrift and work in the foundations of mathematics. His book the Foundations of Arithmetic is the seminal text of the logicist project, and is cited by Michael Dummett as where to pinpoint the linguistic turn. His philosophical papers ""On Sense and Reference"" and ""The Thought"" are also widely cited. The former argues for two different types of meaning and descriptivism. In Foundations and ""The Thought"", Frege argues for Platonism against psychologism or formalism, concerning numbers and propositions respectively. Russell\'s paradox undermined the logicist project by showing Frege\'s Basic Law V in the Foundations to be false.']",0,real

854,854,"['A bit of both . There can definitely be science to it : Science - If you * * adjust the "" levels "" * * ( hard to explain , but kind of like adjusting the contrast at different brightnesses ) you can sometimes physically see the modification . For example in a recent controversy , this photo won an award : [ "" Original "" ] ( URL_4 ) . Can you see what \'s wrong with it ? ( Clue : it \'s possible to see by looking closely at the right place ) If you said the plane has been photoshopped in , you \'d be right . And if you did n\'t already see it , maybe you can now . If not , how about we adjust the levels : [ Adjusted image ] ( URL_2 ) Well , that \'s dramatic , is n\'t it ? This is a fairly obvious one where , to be honest , the photoshopping was n\'t done that well - but it can still work pretty well for detecting this kind of image made from other images . This works because an image edit is done to fool the human eye - people will edit the picture enough to fool someone looking at it , and not much more . To counter it , we change things enough that we \'re limiting the amount of information . By removing the colour and bumping the contrast up , we can see small changes much more clearly . Then there are other techniques : you can * * compare the compression ratio on different parts of the image * * . Basically this involves looking at a group of pixels and ( with knowledge of how an image is compressed ) working out whether different areas of the image have different compression ratios by seeing how many mistakes there are . These ca n\'t be seen ( easily ) by the human eye , but can be calculated by a computer . Why does that matter ? Because if you can tell that two different part of the image have been compressed by different amounts , that \'s a pretty obvious sign that the image has been modified : one part has been compressed more times than another part , so the part with fewer compressions ca n\'t have been there in the first place . Experience - science - Sometimes you can apply a scientific technique based on experience . For example if you know the camera that made an image , you may know that the camera has a "" signature "" , eg an unusual colour balance . Some camera phones , for example , have an unusually blue hue to photos . If the photo was taken by that phone , but has a different hue to others in the series , it may have had the colour adjusted . This is where we start to get into experience , rather than straight up analysis . There may well be other techniques I \'m not aware of , but those will catch a lot of edits . Kinda - science - Then there are simpler checks : some image editing programs will add information to the file to state that it was saved by that program , or the date may change : eg if you send me a series of 6 photos from the same place , and all of them have a "" last modified "" date that fits , but one is a few days / weeks later , that \'s a fairly clear sign the file has been changed ... a clever editor will usually change these , but you may forget or miss one . Experience - And then we have the truly "" experience "" stuff , where it comes down to knowing what to look for and finding clues or evidence . For example on that plane photo , it was originally caught out because people looked closely and caught the telltale "" rectangle "" shape around the aircraft that shows it was copied in and then attempted to blur the two images together . In other photos , they may look for things like missing fingers or limbs ( surprisingly common , [ example ] ( URL_0 ) ) in photos of people , or for straight lines "" bending "" , eg if someone has tried to adjust a person \'s figure to make them look thinner / fatter , sometimes they will accidentally move a nearby doorframe or stripy carpet . [ Example ] ( URL_1 ) Other things to look for are "" perfect "" hair or where someone has over - done the photoshop , making things a little too good to be true . Hair is always a good one to look at , as it \'s very difficult to edit perfectly , and you can sometimes find strands that are a different colour where they were missed . Reflections are always a great one for this : [ Example ] ( URL_3 ) With hair particularly , but also generally , you can look at the areas between colours and see if the editor accidentally slipped over onto the "" next "" area when modifying them .', 'You have to carefully examine the image . In digital photography , there may be pixelation or other clear signs of modification . Inconsistent focus or lighting are big clues -- shadows should properly cast themselves on all subjects in the picture , for example , and objects at the same distance from the viewer should normally be in the same focus .', 'Hi dctrhu , You asked two questions : 1 . Is there science to it ? Absolutely . 2 . Is it like a crime scene where you just have to infer something from certain clues and cues ? Definitely . ( Full disclosure : Doing digital photo analysis is a big part of my daily job . And I created the URL_1 web site as a means to get other people interested in this field . ) The scientific method is based on logical reasoning . There are two main types of logical reasoning : deductive and inductive . ( There are others , but these are the two main ones that people typically discuss . ) Deductive reasoning is based on causality . "" A "" leads to "" B "" leads to "" C "" . For example : Neal is typing on his computer . Neal \'s computer is in his office . Therefore , Neal is in his office . Deductive reasoning is objective ( it does n\'t matter what you think ; these are the facts ) . In contrast , inductive reasoning is subjective and based on experience . This is often used for predicting , forecasting , and behavioral analysis -- situations with inherent uncertainty . ( "" Did someone alter this picture ? "" or "" did a camera generate this ? "" evaluate behaviors with inherent uncertainty . ) To quote a paragraph from URL_0 : > Inductive reasoning is the opposite of deductive reasoning . Inductive reasoning makes broad generalizations from specific observations . "" In inductive inference , we go from the specific to the general . We make many observations , discern a pattern , make a generalization , and infer an explanation or a theory , "" Wassertheil - Smoller told Live Science . "" In science there is a constant interplay between inductive inference ( based on observations ) and deductive inference ( based on theory ) , until we get closer and closer to the \' truth , \' which we can only approach but not ascertain with complete certainty . "" As an example , if you have ever broken a bone then you likely had an X - ray . The X - ray permits an analyst to view details that would otherwise go unseen . The X - ray is objective , not subjective . The X - ray system is based on deductive reasoning . ( We shoot X - rays into an arm and the bone absorbs / reflects differently than the soft tissues . This permits visualizing the bone without cutting open the arm . ) However , the X - ray image does not draw any conclusions about the subject matter . When the X - ray technician says , "" I can not tell you that it is broken because a diagnosis requires a doctor "" , then you enter the realm of the subjective . ( This is why you can ask for a "" second opinion "" -- opinions are subjective . ) Diagnosis are based on inductive reasoning . Continuing the example : arm hurts , X - ray shows a break in the bone , so the diagnosis is a broken arm . This conclusion is based on experience : I \'ve never seen a broken arm without a break visible in the X - ray , and I \'ve never seen an unbroken arm with a break in the X - ray , so it is very likely a broken arm . Most photo analysis methods act like an X - ray , permitting the visualization of otherwise - unseen attributes . The interpretation of the results requires a human to make a subjective determination based on specific factors ( inductive reasoning ) . In the case of digital photo forensics , it is usually difficult to prove that a picture is real or untampered . However , there are some telltale signs that can indicate alteration . These indicators can be used for deductive reasoning . ( E.g. , If it \'s supposed to be directly from a Nikon camera and it \'s missing Nikon metadata , then it is n\'t directly from a Nikon camera . ) We can also use these artifacts with inductive reasoning . For example , if the picture is supposed to be unaltered and one section has a significantly different noise signature and compression ratio and coloring than the rest of the picture , then it was likely altered . The word "" likely "" is predictive and requires inductive reasoning . Depending on the algorithm , we can even identify a confidence interval for the accuracy ( likeliness ) of the conclusion . For example : "" I compared the noise signature to that of 1,000 camera original pictures covering 200 different similar camera models . None of the camera originals had noise patterns that varied by region . So my confidence is in excess of 99 % accuracy . "" -- after showing that 1,000 pictures from 200 cameras is a good - enough sample size . Conclusively proving that a picture is real / unaltered can be difficult . ( E.g. , "" I saw him take the picture with the camera and this picture came straight from the camera . "" ) However , using inductive and deductive reasoning , we can rule out options . For example , if Adobe always leaves telltale artifacts and none are present , then we can rule out Adobe . Gimp leaves other artifacts , so we can rule that out . If we can rule out all of the common alteration methods , then we can conclude that it is likely real / unaltered . More often , we conclude with something like "" based on the tests performed , there is no indication of tampering or alteration "" . This does n\'t mean it is real ; it only means we did n\'t detect anything wrong . And if we have no reason to suspect sophisticated tampering outside of the scope of the tests performed , then we can induce that it is likely real / unaltered .']",0,real

There are some more recent pieces where the brass instruments are the ones carrying the melody , but I do n't remember them off the top of my head ."", ""Because that is the tradition of symphonies , which are rooted in early classical , if not Baroque , design . There are concert band pieces that do not utilize any strings as part of the ensemble and therefore require the brass , woodwinds and even percussion to carry the melody . An easy example is Holst 's Suite in F. There is the issue of brass instruments not having valves until the mid 1800s , but that is ignoring woodwinds and the literature that was written for brass before that ( some of which is amazingly challenging , despite having to use crooks [ different lengths of tubing ] ) . As you get more modern you begin to see some interesting voicing of instruments , for example Stravinsky 's Rite of Spring has a bassoon solo in the beginning which is very noticeable and different sounding . Another Stravinsky example is his Firebird Suite . The Finale uses many different instruments and playing the melody . But the spirit of tradition persists . Instruments have traditional roles . The bass voices play the bass line . Tenor voices play harmony and melody . Alto play harmony . Soprano play melody . I think the larger issue is that more modern pieces tend to be more avant garde in design , so the definition of melody / harmony / bass line becomes more blurred and imprecise . A vicious raspberry on the trumpet can be considered a melody as well as dropping a violin onto the ground . This is unimaginable to the traditional thought and perspective of music that most people in the world grew up with . tl;dr : instrument roles but there are many , many exceptions ."", ""Strings have several advantages- one , it 's the only family with such consistency from the top of the range to the bottom ( as compared with , say , the woodwinds , which goes from bassoon in the bass to the clarinet to the oboe to the flute up on top ) .

And there 's another freedom that the strings possess that is not shared by the brass or winds : strings do n't run on lung power .

863,863,"[""The literal answer to your question 'what determines the price of an ETF' is 'the market'; it is whatever price a buyer is willing to pay and a seller is willing to accept. But if the market price of an ETF share deviates significantly from its NAV, the per-share market value of the securities in its portfolio, then an Authorized Participant can make an arbitrage profit by a transaction (creation or redemption) that pushes the market price toward NAV. Thus as long as the markets are operating and the APs don't vanish in a puff of smoke we can expect price will track NAV. That reduces your question to: why does NAV = market value of the holdings underlying a bond ETF share decrease when the market interest rate rises?  Let's consider an example. I'll use US Treasuries because they have very active markets, are treated as risk-free (although that can be debated), and excluding special cases like TIPS and strips are almost perfectly fungible. And I use round numbers for convenience. Let's assume the current market interest rate is 2% and 'Spindoctor 10-year Treasury Fund' opens for business with $100m invested (via APs) in 10-year T-notes with 2% coupon at par and 1m shares issued that are worth $100 each. Now assume the interest rate goes up to 3% (this is an example NOT A PREDICTION); no one wants to pay par for a 2% bond when they can get 3% elsewhere, so its value goes down to about 0.9 of par (not exactly due to the way the arithmetic works but close enough) and Spindoctor shares similarly slide to $90. At this price an investor gets slightly over 2% (coupon*face/basis) plus approximately 1% amortized capital gain (slightly less due to time value) per year so it's competitive with a 3% coupon at par.  As you say new bonds are available that pay 3%. But our fund doesn't hold them; we hold old bonds with a face value of $100m but a market value of only $90m. If we sell those bonds now and buy 3% bonds to (try to) replace them, we only get $90m par value of 3% bonds, so now our fund is paying a competitive 3% but NAV is still only $90.  At the other extreme, say we hold the 2% bonds to maturity, paying out only 2% interest but letting our NAV increase as the remaining term (duration) and thus discount of the bonds decreases -- assuming the market interest rate doesn't change again, which for 10 years is probably unrealistic (ignoring 2009-2016!). At the end of 10 years the 2% bonds are redeemed at par and our NAV is back to $100 -- but from the investor's point of view they've forgone $10 in interest they could have received from an alternative investment over those 10 years, which is effectively an additional investment, so the original share price of $90 was correct.""]",0,real

881,881,"['From How are indexes weighted?: Market-capitalization weighted indexes (or market cap- or cap-weighted   indexes) weight their securities by market value as measured by   capitalization: that is, current security price * outstanding shares.   The vast majority of equity indexes today are cap-weighted, including   the S&P 500 and the FTSE 100. In a cap-weighted index, changes in the   market value of larger securities move the index’s overall trajectory   more than those of smaller ones. If the fund you are referencing is an ETF then there may be some work to do to figure out what underlying securities to use when handling Creation and Redemption units as an ETF will generally have shares created in 50,000 shares at a time through Authorized Participants. If the fund you are referencing is an open-end fund then there is still cash flows to manage in the fund as the fund has create and redeem shares in on a daily basis. Note in both cases that there can be updates to an index such as quarterly rebalancing of outstanding share counts, changes in members because of mergers, acquisitions or spin-offs and possibly a few other factors. How to Beat the Benchmark has a piece that may also be useful here for those indices with many members from 1998: As you can see, its TE is also persistently positive, but if anything   seems to be declining over time. In fact, the average net TE for the   whole period is +0.155% per month, or an astounding +1.88% pa net   after expenses. The fund expense ratio is 0.61% annually, for a   whopping before expense TE of +2.5% annually. This is once again   highly statistically significant, with p values of 0.015 after   expenses and 0.0022 before expenses. (The SD of the TE is higher for   DFSCX than for NAESX, lowering its degree of statistical   significance.) It is remarkable enough for any fund to beat its   benchmark by 2.5% annually over 17 years, but it is downright eerie to   see this done by an index fund. To complete the picture, since 1992 the Vanguard Extended Index Fund   has beaten its benchmark (the Wilshire 4500) by 0.56% per year after   expenses (0.81% net of expenses), and even the Vanguard Index Trust   500 has beaten its benchmark by a razor thin 0.08% annually before   (but not after) expenses in the same period. So what is going on here? A hint is found in DFA\'s 1996 Reference   Guide: The 9-10 Portfolio captures the return behavior of U.S. small company stocks as identified by Rolf Banz and other academic   researchers. Dimensional employs a ""patient buyer"" discount block   trading strategy which has resulted in negative total trading costs,   despite the poor liquidity of small company stocks. Beginning in 1982,   Ibbotson Associates of Chicago has used the 9-10 Portfolio results to   calculate the performance of small company stocks for their Stocks,   Bonds, Bills, and Inflation yearbook. A small cap index fund cannot possibly own all of the thousands of   stocks in its benchmark; instead it owns a ""representative sample.""   Further, these stocks are usually thinly traded, with wide bid/ask   spreads. In essence what the folks at DFA learned was that they could   tell the market makers in these stocks, ""Look old chaps, we don\'t have   to own your stock, and unless you let us inside your spread, we\'ll   pitch our tents elsewhere. Further, we\'re prepared to wait until a   motivated seller wishes to unload a large block."" In a sense, this   gives the fund the luxury of picking and choosing stocks at prices   more favorable than generally available. Hence, higher long term   returns. It appears that Vanguard did not tumble onto this until a   decade later, but tumble they did. To complete the picture, this strategy works best in the thinnest   markets, so the excess returns are greatest in the smallest stocks,   which is why the positive TE is greatest for the DFA 9-10 Fund, less   in the Vanguard Small Cap Fund, less still in the Vanguard Index   Extended Fund, and minuscule with the S&P500. There are some who say the biggest joke in the world of finance is the   idea of value added active management. If so, then the punch line   seems to be this: If you really want to beat the indexes, then you   gotta buy an index fund.']",0,real

So let me break it down : Smooth pursuit / smooth motion : You tell your brain you want to follow an object . Light hits the back of your eye . That information goes to the back of your brain . The back of your brain transmits that information to areas in the brain that control eye movement . Your eyes move depending on how the object moves . Saccades / Jerky motion : You tell your brain you want your eyes to move to a certain location . That signal ( from the executive , most highest parts of the brain ) gets transmitted to the areas of the brain that control eye movement . Eye moves . See the difference ? The difference is that with smooth pursuit , you rely on direct sensory stimuli , while saccades do not . Of course you have other visual cues that your brain relies on constantly when performing saccades , but in essence , you are commanding your eyes to move a certain way . Brain says "" eyes please move here "" vs brain saying "" eyes , please follow an object . "" Two very different circuits . This is why if you take two finger a yard apart and try to do smooth pursuit , you ca n\'t .

There is no functional benefit to the skin taking it \'s time to regrow and reconnect the tissue properly . This is the same basic idea behind blood clotting ; it \'s a bad idea to simply wait until the blood vessels heal after they are cut , so rather than make it look pretty , a crappy clot just forms over the wound . With wound healing your body is just trying the patch the tissue ( eg . skin ) as a defence mechanism to protect against infection .

Basically you have two different mechanisms for healing 1 ) Scar Tissue ( This is what you are referring to ) 2 ) Regeneration ( This is what happens with tinier scars that can undergo mitosis ) Scar tissue basically happens when you damage part of the body that can not undergo mitosis ( mitosis is when your cells multiply , divide , and repeat to replace the damaged area ) and is unable to heal completely . Like if you imagine had a paper cut . It usually replaces itself over the course of a week and you may have some discoloration that will fade with time . Now imagine receiving a deeper cut , like cutting you hand with a knife , or bit by a squirrel ( verified ) . This damages a layer of the skin that was n't designed to regenerate because it can not undergo mitosis . As a result your body has to find a different way to repair the damage . Scar tissue is the bodies way to fix the damage by isolating the damage since the cells around ca n't repair the damaged area . This also means that if the damage is large enough and no cells are close by scar tissue can form . Even if the cells can regenerate . Let me try to think of an analogy Imagine grass right ? Let 's say that something happens and part of the grass ( Cells ) dies . Either 1 ) New grass will take root and start to grow where the old grass ( Mitosis ) was or 2 ) the dirt ( Extra cellular matrix or cells that under go meosis ) that sustains the grass will be washed away . So what grows in its place ? Another type of grass or weed ( This is glue in the wood block ) .

921,921,"['Natural selection is the differential survival and reproduction of individuals due to differences in phenotype. It is a key mechanism of evolution, the change in the heritable traits characteristic of a population over generations. Charles Darwin popularised the term ""natural selection"", contrasting it with artificial selection, which in his view is intentional, whereas natural selection is not.\nVariation exists within all populations of organisms. This occurs partly because random mutations arise in the genome of an individual organism, and their offspring can inherit such mutations. Throughout the lives of the individuals, their genomes interact with their environments to cause variations in traits. The environment of a genome includes the molecular biology in the cell, other cells, other individuals, populations, species, as well as the abiotic environment. Because individuals with certain variants of the trait tend to survive and reproduce more than individuals with other less successful variants, the population evolves. Other factors affecting reproductive success include sexual selection (now often included in natural selection) and fecundity selection.\nNatural selection acts on the phenotype, the characteristics of the organism which actually interact with the environment, but the genetic\n(heritable) basis of any phenotype that gives that phenotype a reproductive advantage may become more common in a population. Over time, this process can result in populations that specialise for particular ecological niches (microevolution) and may eventually result in speciation  (the emergence of new species, macroevolution). In other words, natural selection is a key process in the evolution of a population.\nNatural selection is a cornerstone of modern biology. The concept, published by Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace in a joint presentation of papers in 1858, was elaborated in Darwin\'s influential 1859 book On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life. He described natural selection as analogous to artificial selection, a process by which animals and plants with traits considered desirable by human breeders are systematically favoured for reproduction. The concept of natural selection originally developed in the absence of a valid theory of heredity; at the time of Darwin\'s writing, science had yet to develop modern theories of genetics. The union of traditional Darwinian evolution with subsequent discoveries in classical genetics formed the modern synthesis of the mid-20th century. The addition of molecular genetics has led to evolutionary developmental biology, which explains evolution at the molecular level. While genotypes can slowly change by random genetic drift, natural selection remains the primary explanation for adaptive evolution.']",0,real

The program was particularly successful at predicting the most accurate structure for targets rated as the most difficult by the competition organisers, where no existing template structures were available from proteins with a partially similar sequence. \nA team that used AlphaFold 2 (2020) repeated the placement in the CASP competition in November 2020. The team achieved a level of accuracy much higher than any other group. It scored above 90 for around two-thirds of the proteins in CASP\'s global distance test (GDT), a test that measures the degree to which a computational program predicted structure is similar to the lab experiment determined structure, with 100 being a complete match, within the distance cutoff used for calculating GDT.\nAlphaFold 2\'s results at CASP were described as ""astounding"" and ""transformational.""

938,938,"['This is gon na be a long one , so just bear with me . Our current understanding of quantum physics operates is called "" quantum field theory . "" The idea is that there are "" fields "" that permeate all of space , and particles are "" excitations "" in those fields . For an analogy , imagine a very still pond . If you put some energy into the pond , maybe by smacking the surface , you \'ll create a ripple in the pond . If you switch the word "" pond "" with "" electron field "" and "" ripple "" with "" electron , "" you have a very basic understanding of quantum field theory . It \'s the study of how those "" ripples "" interact with each other . So , for example , if you have two electrons , they will repel each other because of their charge . The way that \'s understood is that the electron field is "" coupled "" to a second field , the "" electromagnetic "" or "" photon "" field ( I hate both names , personally ) . Take your pond , and imagine that it \'s sitting on top of a layer of some other fluid , like oil . The fluids do n\'t mix , but a ripple in one can cause a ripple in the other . So , the idea is that if there \'s two electrons on the pond , the ripple from electron A will make a ripple in the oil , which goes over to electron B and causes it to be deflected . The "" electron ripples "" did n\'t interact * directly * , they interacted via the oil which they \'re coupled to . An oil ripple "" mediated the interaction , "" it \'s how the electrons managed to exert forces on each other . That all seems well and good , but there \'s a problem . Even in our pond analogy , it seems silly to assume that a ripple in the oil would n\'t affect the water it \'s traveling under as it goes over to the other "" electron . "" After all , if electrons can cause ripples in oil , should n\'t ripples in oil be able to make electrons ? Well , yeah , they can and they do . To use physics terms , a "" ripple in oil "" is actually a so - called "" virtual photon . "" It \'s not actually a photon , but it acts sort of like one . And , like a real photon , it can spontaneously turn into an electron , which is just like how an oil ripple could cause a water ripple . It actually makes an electron / positron pair ( the positron is the antiparticle of the electron ) , which will be important later . So , when we do math , we have to take into a count the fact that this can happen . More specifically , it \'s called a "" loop correction , "" though you do n\'t really need to know why . What happens when we factor in our loop corrections , though , is that we end up with divergences , which are numbers that blow up to infinity . That ca n\'t be correct , so is field theory wrong ? Well , no . What some clever people realized is that the parameters we were plugging into our equations -- the mass / charge of the electron , for example -- were determined by experiment . If QFT is true , though , then the values we obtained experimentally should have the loop corrections * already factored in . * So , there are some "" bare "" quantities which are physical parameters that are true * before * you apply loop corrections , and then there are * renormalizing * quantities that have to be accounted for when you apply loop corrections . Subtracting the bare ( infinite ) quantities from the renormalizing ( also infinite ) quantities gives you the real experimentally verified values , which are finite . Lots of people have objections to this technique , and their objections may very well be sound , but let \'s not go into that . Suffice to say that saying "" infinity minus infinity = something finite "" is really hand - wavey , and should give most mathematicians headaches . Now , gravity . Let \'s suppose that it works like electromagnetism . Particles with mass ( we might as well just stick with electrons ) are ripples in a pond , and they sit on top another type of "" oil pond "" called the "" gravity pond , "" just like how it sat on the "" photon pond . "" The problem is that the loop corrections for gravity wo n\'t be renormalizable . Suppose my "" gravity ripple , "" which is called a "" graviton , "" is just like the photon , and it can make electrons as well . It should , after all , for the same reasons that the photon could . The problem is that what happens as the graviton travels from electron A to electron B is that it just makes more electrons . Those electrons should be attracted to each other , which strengthens gravity even more . Then , those electrons make * more * electrons through their interaction with the original pair , and the attraction gets even stronger , and then those electrons make * more * ... and so on . With electromagnetism , this was n\'t as much of an issue . Remember how I said what actually happens is that an electron / positron * pair * is produced ? Well , positrons are positively charged , so having the positron there cancels out the additional repulsion that the extra electron would \'ve made . Renormalization was still an issue , but for different reasons . Here , though , we ca n\'t write off that extra interaction strength because of the new masses . There \'s no "" negative mass "" to counteract that extra attraction , there \'s just more and more mass . So , the loop corrections to quantum gravity are divergent ( blow up to infinity ) , but not in a way that we can renormalize away . What happens is that as we try to add renormalization parameters , we start just needing to add more and more and more of them : an infinite number , in fact . Hence , gravity is not renormalizable , because we ca n\'t keep just tacking on parameters in a meaningful way just to force the theory to work out the way we want . edit : By the way , I should mention that quantum gravity does work on sufficiently large scales . It \'s somewhat counter - intuitive , but the greater the interaction distance , the * less * loop corrections matter . They can be effectively ignored at certain scales , as can the loop corrections for electromagnetism .', ""I think that the problem is due to QM assuming that everything works by fields but GR saying that gravity is actually a bending of space , more than just another field . So there is a problem reconciling Electromagnetism , Strong nuclear and weak forces on the one side and Gravity on the other side . I 'm not sure if there are actually any contradictions or paradoxes or if its simply that they 're not united ."", ""It 's about different scales .

Secondly , the quality of the actual flash storage is different . Many MicroSD cards would n't be able to handle the sheer amount of actual data writing involved in effectively running an OS . MicroSD cards are mainly used for occasional writing and more often , lots of reading . This means the storage is n't changed much , which gives the appearance of a great quality and long lasting product . Take it from experience , start writing GBs of data to a MicroSD card over and over and soon enough it 'll fail . It 's why desktop SSD 's are n't just loads of MicroSD cards slotted together . The storage in the iPhone had to be of similar quality to that in a desktop SSD . It has to run a full mobile OS , frequently write data ( pictures , music , videos , text messages etc . ) and still perform at fast speeds with minimal to no loss in overall capacity over a long period of time . It has to have near zero failure as it 'll cause the entire device to fail ( think system file corruption ) . It 's also in constant 24/7/365 use for several years . While it 's well known the actual storage does n't really cost that much as Apple buy so much of it , the fact is that they charge a premium for their devices , and they can also make bigger profit margins by charging more for more internal capacity . An extra £ 80 for doubling the capacity each time ( although that 's now changed slightly with the 6 and 6 + ) . The final thing is this : by controlling the storage as internal only , Apple can control the overall experience further . A MicroSD card with a read / write speed of say 20/20Mbps versus 200/200Mbps would give very different results when copying data or playing back HD films .

This can be either a sick nerve or a nerve that has had an injury. Electrical, shooting would be others implying nerve source for pain.Location of pain: There is a lot to this. First, if something goes in the pathway of a nerve, then that is the nerve involved. Nerves are long and the pain is in a belt-like long pathway. Smaller areas are smaller nerves. This also tends to say what might be going on. Obviously if there was an injury to the area and then there was pain outward from it ""hit a nerve"" would be a possibility. Sick nerves are multiple areas and tend to be the TIPS of the nerve not the whole nerve.What hurts: Moving a particular way that triggers the pain tells what is hurting. Specifically it can distinguish outward structures like skin, muscles, tendons, joints from deep structures like organs and nerves.There is the pain. There is the context of it. If it is getting less that is perceived as good regardless of the pain. If the patient is making a lot of pain, then after the patient, the pain is less.Pain exists, at multiple levels of abstraction. There is how it is held.

954,954,"['Asking why the p/e was so high is best answered ""because reported earnings were so low"". Recall that the S&P500 bottomed in early March 2009 when the panic of the financial crisis reached exhaustion.  As noted on the page you have linked, the reported p/e ratios are computed using reported earnings from the trailing twelve months.  During those twelve months the banks were writing down all of the bad debt associated with the mortgage backed securities that has lost so much value.  This meant that the banks were reporting negative earnings.  Since the financial sector is a large part of the S&P500, this alone had an enormous effect on the index p/e.  However, the problem was compounded by a general collapse in earnings across the economy as consumers reacted to the resulting uncertainty.  The same site reports earnings for the previous years at $17.11 for the S&P500, compared to $76.17 for the year prior to 2008.  That is a collapse of about 78% in earnings.  Although the S&P500 has suffered badly during this time, stock market investors being forward looking were starting to price in improved earnings by May 2009.  Indeed, the S&P500 was up about 33% in just two months, from its low in March2009 to mid May2009.  Thus, by May of 2009 prices were not suffering to the same extent as reported trailing earnings.

955,955,"[""I would like to offer a different perspective here.  The standard fee for a credit card transaction is typically on the order of 30 cents + 2.5% of the amount (the actual numbers vary, but this is the ballpark). This makes small charges frequently unprofitable for small merchants. Because of this they will often have minimum purchase requirements for credit/debit card payments. The situation changes for large retailers (think Wal-mart, Target, Safeway, Home Depot). I cannot find a citation for this right now, but large retailers are able to negotiate volume discounts from credit card companies (a guy who used to work in finance at Home Depot told me this once). Their transaction fees are MUCH lower than 30 cents + 2.5%. But you get the same reward points on your credit card/debit card regardless of where you swipe it. So my personal philosophy is: large chain - swipe away without guilt for any amount. Small merchant - use cash unless it's hundreds of dollars (and then they may give you a cash discount in that case). And make sure to carry enough cash for such situations.

But starting your own business is not a pure game of chance. It mostly depends on how good your business idea is and if you have the necessary skills and resources to succeed with it. Yes, there is luck involved, but a smart businessman can calculate the risks and possible rewards and then decide if a certain business idea is a good or a bad gamble. Also, a business failing does not necessarily mean that the business owner failed. A good business owner knows when to fold. A business might be profitable at first, but market circumstances might change at any time making it unprofitable. A smart business owner notices that early, liquidates the unprofitable business as quickly as possible and refocuses on their next business idea. Only those who can not let go of an unprofitable business or take too long to notice that it is failing are those who get dragged down with it. So should you have a ""startup fund""? Saving your disposable income is never a mistake. If you never end up starting a business, it will eventually serve you as a retirement fund. So yes, you should save a part of your money each month.

962,962,"['The "" cones "" themselves are shock diamonds , and are a characteristic of supersonic flow ( so , they happen all the time in rocket and very high - performance jet engines ) . The shock diamonds occur because the exhaust is overexpanded by the nozzle , and is actually at lower pressure than the ambient air . As it moves away from the exhaust nozzle , the atmospheric air pushes in on it , which causes the exhaust to contract ( which you can see in the fact that the gas sort of necks inwards right after it leaves the nozzle ) . However , this contraction happens very very suddenly in the form of a shock wave , and typically with this shock / compression wave you also get an expansion fan as a sort of "" rebound "" within the flow . When these compression and expansion waves overlap , [ you get the actual shock diamonds visible in the flow . ] ( URL_0 )', ""A really great french youtube channel just did a very cool couple of video about the flames of rocket thruster . I will try to summary what it says . ( [ if you want the link , but it 's in French ] ( URL_0 ) ) The cone - shaped part of the thruster where the gaz is ejected ( I think it 's called a nozzle ? ) is designed for a specific ambient pressure . The goal is to get the pressure in the ejected gaz at the same level as the ambient pressure : the bigger the diameter of the nozzle , the lower the pressure of the ejected gaz . However , it 's not really feasible to change the size of the nozzle in flight to adapt to the change of atmospheric pressure , so they have a diameter that 's not optimal at all altitude . Because of this , the ambient pressure is greater than the gaz pressure until it reach a certain altitude . ( This is the case on this picture ) . So the higher ambient pressure will push on the ejected gaz , reducing its diameter . Another important part of the explanation , is that there is a pressure wave in the ejected gaz . This wave looks kinda like a sin wave , and if you look closely on the picture , we can sort of see it : it goes from the edge of the nozzle , to the the middle of the flame ( the shiny spots in the flame ) . Where the pressure waves coming from all around the edge of the nozzle intersect ( the shiny spot ) , the gaz is brutally slowed down and there is a congestion . Because of this , the pressure of the gaz at this point gets higher than the ambient pressure , making the diameter of the flame bigger . Then because the diameter is getting bigger , the pressure in the gaz decrease , the ambient pressure is higher again , and we 're back to step 1 ."", ""So basically the air being exhausted by the engine has to be equal in pressure to the air around it . When air is moving at a high speed it 's pressure decreases to below what ambient air pressure would be . The conical shapes that you see are actually a series of oblique shocks that the flow takes . These shocks compress the airflow back to the outside air pressure which is why you can see the cones become harder to see as the shocks become weaker . Basically the airflow is at too low of pressure and needs to be compressed to ambient air pressure and the oblique shocks are how it does that""]",0,real

968,968,"[""As others have explained defined contribution is when you (or your employer) contributes a specified amount and you reap all the investment returns.  Defined benefit is when your employer promises to pay you a specified amount (benefit) and is responsible for making the necessary investments to provide for it.   Is one better than the other? We can argue this either way.   Defined benefit would seem to be more predictable and assured.  The problem being of course that it is entirely reliant upon the employer to have saved enough money to pay that amount.  If the employer fails in that responsibility, then the only fallback is government guarantees.  And of course the government has limitations on what it can guarantee.  For example, from Wikipedia:   The maximum pension benefit guaranteed by PBGC is set by law and adjusted yearly. For plans that end in 2016, workers who retire at age 65 can receive up to $5,011.36 per month (or $60,136 per year) under PBGC's insurance program for single-employer plans. Benefit payments starting at ages other than 65 are adjusted actuarially, which means the maximum guaranteed benefit is lower for those who retire early or when there is a benefit for a survivor, and higher for those who retire after age 65. Additionally, the PBGC will not fully guarantee benefit improvements that were adopted within the five-year period prior to a plan's termination or benefits that are not payable over a retiree's lifetime. Other limitations also apply to supplemental benefits in excess of normal retirement benefits, benefit increases within the last five years before a plan's termination, and benefits earned after a plan sponsor's bankruptcy. By contrast, people tend to control their own defined contribution accounts.  So they control how much gets invested and where.  Defined contribution accounts are always 100% funded.   Defined benefit pension plans are often underfunded.  They expect the employer to step forward and subsidize them when they run short.  This allows the defined benefits to both be cheaper during the employment period and more generous in retirement.  But it also means that employers have to subsidize the plans later, when they no longer get a benefit from the relationship with the employee.   If you want someone else to make promises to you and aren't worried that they won't keep them, you probably prefer defined benefit.   If you want to have personal control over the money, you probably prefer defined contribution.   My personal opinion is that defined benefit plans are a curse.  They encourage risky behavior and false promises.  Defined contribution plans are more honest about what they provide and better match the production of employment with its compensation.  Others see defined benefit plans as the gold standard of pensions.""]",0,real

Furthermore, I\'m sure that the buyers would want you to fix all these things anyway, or reduce the price accordingly, but let\'s ignore this. Let\'s also ignore the remaining mortgage, since it looks like you can comfortably pay it off. Assuming 10% property management and 10% average vacancy (check your market), and rental price at $1000 - you end up with these numbers: I took very conservative estimates both on the rent (lower than you expect) and the maintenance expense (although on average over the years ,since you need to have some reserves, this is probably quite reasonable). You end up with 2.7% ROI, which is not a lot for a rental. The rule of thumb your wife mentioned (1% of cash equity) is indeed usually for ROI of leveraged rental purchase. However, if rental prices in your area are rising, as it sounds like they are, you may end up there quite soon anyway. The downside is that the money is locked in. If you\'re confident in your ability to rent and are not loosing the tax benefit of selling since it sounds like you\'ve not appreciated, you may take out some cash through a cash-out refi. To keep cash-flow near-0, you need to cash out so that the payments would be at or less than the $3200/year (i.e.: $266/month). That would make about $50K at 30/yr fixed 5% loan.

The tower is then refilled during times when the system is n\'t operating at peak loads . Secondly ( and more interestingly ) they help maintain water pressure in the system .

It \'s because there is constant water pressure in your pipes and water is sitting right there at the tap waiting for you to open the valve so it can come out .

So if you accidentally put 91 octane in a car that expects 87 you likely wo n't damage the engine ( and visa versa ) unless you do so over long periods of time . And even then the computers in cars these days can usually detect it and control the parts of the engine to compensate . However , if you put E85 gas in an engine not equipped to handle it you will likely put holes in your fuel line as the extra ethanol requires a different type of plastic tubing than is standard in non - E85 burning cars . Similarly , putting diesel in a gasoline car will likely damage your engine . So they separate the hoses and vary the sizes of the nozzles to help protect customers from making a mistake that could damage their engines ."", 'Before I can answer that , I must tell you what a "" four - stroke "" engine is . If you know , skip the following paragraph . A four stroke engine means it is an engine with four steps , used in cars , boats , and even certain airplanes . First , there \'s a spot in the engine called a "" cylinder "" , which is best described as a short tube . In one end , is the piston which goes up and down . In the other end , is 2 specially designed valves ( intake valve and exhaust valve ) and a spark plug . ● Step one is the intake valve opens puts a mixture of gasoline and air inside the cylinder , then closes to seal up . ● Step two is the piston goes up and adds tremendous pressure but squeezing everything tightly like when you have a closed water bottle and squeeze it . This step is compression . ● Step three is ignition . The spark plug simply sparks and ignites the mixture of gasoline and air and causes a tiny explosion which slams the piston down . The piston is connected to another portion of the engine that generates torque , which turns the wheels on a car . Or propeller on the plane . ● Step four is exhaust . The exhaust valve opens and takes out all the used and burned mixture and spits it out the car , then closes so step one can happen again . "" Intake , compression , ignition , and exhaust "" . Common gasoline ( 87,89,91 ) burns the way it does . The difference between those grades is the bigger the number , the harder it is to burn . If you have a HIGH PERFORMANCE engine , the high grade is worth it since your engine is meant for that work . If you have an average car , do NOT get the high grade gas . Getting high grade gas is not only more expensive , but is harder to burn , resulting in your engine working way harder to burn it , and making poor results . Grade of gas DOESN\'T equal power / speed . ( If you \'re curious what grade you have , check the owner manual . You also might find out on the gas tank cover inside . ) ● The difference between 87 - 91 & Diesel : Diesel gas has been improved to be way more efficient than in the past and burns like our typical graded gasolines . The thought of it being the heavy polluting , smelly gas of big rigs and buses is pretty outdated . Diesel engines and our standard car engines however , work differently . As in the explanation , our engines ignite the gasoline using spark plugs to get the power . Diesel engines however , just compress the gasoline so much , that enough heat builds up to burn the fuel without need of ignition . That means the diesel engine compresses at a higher pressure , and the gasoline burns at a higher energy output . Meaning it \'s actually more fuel efficient than 87 - 91 , but of course that \'s for the big and powerful engines that can handle the power needed to squeeze and compress the gas and air at that level . ● E85 and 87 - 91 : e85 is an environmental gasoline . There \'s advantages but disadvantages to using it . e85 costs less at the pump and is better for the environment than standard gasoline , making it less harmful to nature , and your wallet . The issue with it , is that the fuel economy is significantly worse . As covered in the difference between 87 & 91 , it takes more work to burn 91 grade gas . This means E85 must be super simple to burn . That is correct , but it also means your engine uses it up quickly . It does n\'t mean your engine pumps more gas in the cylinders or any of that , that does n\'t happen . But E85 burning easily means there \'s less power generated , resulting in YOU BURNING MORE TO ACHIEVE THE SAME RESULT . A test by URL_0 ( I \'ll post a link ) compared E85 to our typical gas . Using E85 , the fuel economy ( miles per gallon , mpg ) went down in his Chevrolet Tahoe from 18 miles on standard , to 13 on the same amount of e85 gas . This resulted in more stops at a gas station for e85 , more money spent on gasoline because of the frequent fuelling , and less use of his dollar because of how little use can be brought out of it . In total , he spent more money and used more time filling an inefficient gas to save the environment . The reason e85 is n\'t as good as it seems is because e85 burns so nicely . If you burn a gallon of 91 grade gasoline and a gallon of e85 gasoline , the e85 easily makes less pollution and helps the environment . But because your engine relies on the power produced instead of pollution reduced , you would burn MORE e85 to compete against the gallon of grade 91 , resulting in similar amount of pollution anyway . Long story short : Diesel gasoline does n\'t burn from spark plugs . The engine just compresses it enough until it gets hot to burn by itself . The power made from it makes it super efficient for the hard working engine . Typical 87 - 91 gas gets compressed to a certain level , and then is ignited by a spark plug to burn . Check on your gas tank cover or owners manual to learn which is best for your car . E85 burns less efficient but produces less pollution per gallon . If you must use more of it to do the same as your grade 87 - 91 gasoline , you \'re better off saving money and using the standard gas . Useful only for the engine designed for it . If you stick it in any random car , you \'re not going to get better results .

Your skin's cells produce a pigment called melanin in response to UV rays, which helps to protect your skin from the sun's harmful effects. When your skin produces more melanin, it becomes darker, and this is what we call a tan. Sunscreen and tanning lotion are products that you can use to protect your skin from the sun's UV rays. Sunscreen works by creating a physical barrier on your skin that blocks the UV rays from reaching your skin cells.

There is no limit on how tanned someone can be, but it is important to remember that getting too much sun exposure can be harmful to your skin.

Even if you only have one index fund in your 401(k), your allocation to that fund can drift over time due to market movements. For example, if the value of the index fund increases significantly, your allocation to it may become larger than you intended. Rebalancing helps to bring your portfolio back to its target allocation.Second, rebalancing can help to manage risk. If your 401(k) is heavily weighted toward a single index fund, and that fund experiences a sharp decline in value, it could have a significant impact on your overall portfolio. Rebalancing can help to spread out the risk by selling some of the index fund and using the proceeds to purchase other investments.Finally, rebalancing can help to capture returns. When you sell a portion of an investment that has increased in value and use the proceeds to purchase other investments, you can potentially capture some of those gains while also diversifying your portfolio.Overall, whether or not to rebalance your 401(k) with a single index fund is a personal decision that depends on your investment goals, risk tolerance, and other factors. It may be helpful to review your portfolio periodically to ensure that it is aligned with your goals and to consider whether rebalancing is appropriate.

1104,1104,"['Example-based machine translation (EBMT) is a type of machine translation (MT) that relies on a database of translated sentence pairs to translate new text. The basic idea behind EBMT is that it can use these examples as a reference to guide the translation of new text, by finding similar examples in the database and adapting them to fit the new text.\n\n\n\nTo use EBMT, the system first builds a database of translated sentence pairs, which can be obtained through manual translation or machine translation. The database is then used as a reference for translating new text. When a new sentence needs to be translated, the system searches the database for examples that are similar to the new sentence and uses them as a reference to generate a translation.\n\n\n\nEBMT is a relatively simple and fast method of machine translation, but it has some limitations. One limitation is that it relies on the availability of good quality, relevant examples in the database, which may not always be the case. Additionally, EBMT can struggle to handle text that is significantly different from the examples in the database, or text that contains words or phrases that are not present in the database.\n\n\n\nOverall, EBMT can be a useful tool for machine translation, particularly in situations where there is a limited amount of text to be translated and the quality of the translation is not critical.

It does this by using coils of wire and a magnetic field. \nInside a transformer, there are two coils of wire called the primary coil and the secondary coil. The primary coil is connected to a source of electricity, such as a power outlet, and the secondary coil is connected to a device that needs electricity, such as a lamp. \nWhen electricity flows through the primary coil, it creates a magnetic field around the coil. This magnetic field then causes a current to flow in the secondary coil, which creates its own magnetic field. The two magnetic fields interact with each other, causing energy to be transferred from the primary coil to the secondary coil. \nThe amount of energy that is transferred depends on the number of coils in each of the primary and secondary coils. If the secondary coil has fewer coils than the primary coil, it will receive less energy, which means the voltage of the electricity in the secondary circuit will be lower than the voltage in the primary circuit.

Inertia is a property of matter that causes it to resist changes in its motion. For example, if you are riding in a car that suddenly comes to a stop, your body will continue moving forward until it is stopped by something else (like a seatbelt). This is because your body has inertia, and it wants to keep moving in the direction it was already going. In a spacecraft, inertia can cause all sorts of problems. Imagine you are flying through space and you suddenly need to turn or change direction. If you just started turning the ship, your body would still be moving straight ahead, and you would feel like you were being thrown to the side. This can be very uncomfortable and even dangerous. That's where inertial dampeners come in. They work by creating a field around the spacecraft that helps to cancel out the effects of inertia. This means that when the spacecraft turns or changes direction, the field helps to keep you from feeling like you are being thrown around. Inertial dampeners are very important because they make space travel much more comfortable and safe for the people on board.

Recessive genes are genes that are not expressed in an individual unless they have two copies of the gene, one from each parent. If an individual has only one copy of the recessive gene, it is ""masked"" by the dominant gene and does not show up in the individual\'s physical appearance. However, if an individual mates with another individual who also has a copy of the same recessive gene, their offspring has a higher chance of inheriting two copies of the gene and expressing the trait associated with that gene.\r\n\r\nInbreeding can also lead to a decrease in genetic diversity, which can make a population more susceptible to diseases and environmental challenges.

The main reason marijuana is illegal is because it has been perceived to have potential for abuse and no accepted medical use. This classification has been in place since 1970, when the Controlled Substances Act was passed. There are a few different reasons why marijuana was made illegal in the first place. One reason is that there were concerns about the potential negative effects of marijuana on people's health. Some people believed that marijuana could lead to mental health problems, addiction, and other negative consequences. Another reason marijuana was made illegal is because of its association with certain social groups and activities, such as counterculture and drug use.

To solve this problem, some planes were fitted with special mechanisms called ""synchronizers"" or ""interrupters"" that allowed the machine gun to fire only when the propeller blades were not in the way. \nHere\'s how it works: The machine gun is mounted on the plane\'s fuselage, and the bullets are fed into the gun through a belt of ammunition. The synchronizer is a device that connects the machine gun to the plane\'s engine, and it monitors the position of the propeller blades. When the synchronizer senses that a propeller blade is about to pass in front of the gun, it temporarily stops the gun from firing. As the blade moves out of the way, the synchronizer allows the gun to start firing again. \nThis way, the machine gun can fire continuously without damaging the propeller.

1233,1233,"[""There are several reasons why real-term bond yields may be declining. One possible reason is that the demand for bonds is increasing, which can push down yields. This may be because investors are seeking safe haven assets in times of economic uncertainty or because central banks are buying large amounts of bonds as part of their monetary policy.Another possible reason for declining real-term bond yields is that inflation expectations are falling. When investors expect that prices will rise more slowly in the future, they may be willing to accept lower yields on bonds. This is because the purchasing power of the bond's future cash flows will be worth more in the face of lower inflation.For investors, declining real-term bond yields can have both positive and negative implications. On the one hand, falling yields may lead to capital appreciation for bondholders, as the market value of existing bonds tends to rise when yields fall. On the other hand, declining yields can also reduce the income that investors receive from their bond investments.It's important to note that the direction of bond yields is not necessarily predictable and can be influenced by a wide range of factors, including economic conditions, monetary policy, and investor sentiment.

Some of the most common include:Low inflation: If inflation is low, the purchasing power of the money that investors receive from bond coupons and principal payments is likely to be maintained over time. As a result, investors may be willing to accept lower yields on bonds.Central bank policy: Central banks can influence bond yields through their monetary policy decisions. For example, if a central bank lowers interest rates or engages in quantitative easing (which involves buying large amounts of government bonds), it can put downward pressure on bond yields.Economic conditions: Bond yields may also decline in response to economic conditions such as slow growth, low levels of business activity, or high levels of uncertainty. In such cases, investors may be more risk-averse and willing to accept lower yields in exchange for the relative safety of fixed-income investments.Demographic factors: An aging population may also contribute to declining bond yields, as older investors tend to have a greater demand for fixed-income investments.For investors, declining bond yields can have both positive and negative implications. On the one hand, lower yields can make bonds more attractive as investments, as investors will receive a lower return but may still be able to preserve their capital.

The carbon-14 in the animal or plant's body starts to break down into other elements.Scientists can use special equipment to measure the amount of carbon-14 in a sample. They compare the amount of carbon-14 in the sample to the amount of carbon-14 in a living animal or plant. This helps them figure out how long it has been since the animal or plant died.The carbon dating method works well for things that are hundreds or thousands of years old.

1270,1270,"[""Digital media can deteriorate in a few different ways. First, let's define what digital media is. Digital media is any type of media that is stored and accessed using computers and other electronic devices, rather than being stored on physical objects like film or tapes. Examples of digital media include things like music files, video files, and documents that are stored on a computer or on a device like a phone or a tablet. Now, let's talk about how digital media can deteriorate. One way that digital media can deteriorate is if the storage device it is saved on fails or becomes damaged. For example, if you save a music file on your computer's hard drive and the hard drive fails, you may no longer be able to access the file. Similarly, if you save a file on a USB drive and the drive becomes damaged or corrupted, you may also be unable to access the file. Another way that digital media can deteriorate is if the file itself becomes corrupted. This can happen if the file is saved improperly or if it is damaged while being transferred from one device to another. If a file is corrupted, it may not be able to be opened or played properly. Finally, digital media can also deteriorate over time if it is not properly preserved and maintained. Just like physical media like film and tapes can degrade over time, digital media can also degrade if it is not properly cared for. For example, if you save a file on a device and then leave it unused for a long period of time, the file may become less accessible or may not work as well as it did when it was first saved. To prevent digital media from deteriorating, it's important to make sure that you are storing it on a reliable storage device, and to regularly back up your files to a separate device. It's also a good idea to keep your devices and software up to date, and to follow best practices for preserving digital media, like avoiding exposing it to extreme temperatures or moisture.""]",1,fake

This can make it easier for the borrower to afford the loan.Flexibility: Interest-only loans can provide flexibility to borrowers who expect their income to increase in the future. For example, if a borrower expects to receive a raise or promotion in the near future, they may choose an interest-only loan so that they can afford the lower payments in the short term.Investment opportunities: Some borrowers choose interest-only loans so that they can use their extra cash to invest in other opportunities, such as real estate or stocks.Cons:Higher overall costs: Because the borrower is not paying down any of the principal balance during the interest-only period, the overall cost of the loan will be higher than it would be with a traditional loan.Risk of payment shock: When the interest-only period ends, the borrower must start paying down the principal in addition to the interest.

A subnet mask is a 32-bit number that is used to divide a network into smaller subnetworks, or subnets. It works by dividing the IP address of a device into two parts: the network portion and the host portion. The subnet mask determines which part of the IP address belongs to the network and which part belongs to the host. Now, let\'s say you want to create subnets for a network with the IP address range 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.255. To do this, you need to decide how many subnets you want to create and how many hosts you want on each subnet. For example, let\'s say you want to create 4 subnets, each with 16 hosts. To calculate the subnet mask, you would do the following: Write down the number of subnets and hosts in binary form. In this case, you want 4 subnets, so you would write ""100"" in binary. You want 16 hosts, so you would write ""10000"" in binary. Add the two binary numbers together. In this case, the sum is ""100010000"". Convert the binary number to decimal form. To do this, you would multiply each digit by the corresponding power of 2 and add the results. In this case, the decimal form of the binary number is ""320"". Write down the IP address range in dot-decimal notation. In this case, the IP address range is 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.255. Add the subnet mask to the IP address. To do this, you would combine the subnet mask (320) with the IP address using dot-decimal notation. The resulting IP address would be ""192.168.1.320"". This is the basic process for calculating the subnet mask of a network. I hope this helps to explain the concept! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.']",1,fake

The equation says that energy (E) is equal to mass (m) multiplied by the speed of light (c) squared. This equation is important because it helps us understand how energy and mass are related to each other. It tells us that mass and energy are two forms of the same thing, and that they can be converted into each other. For example, if you have a lot of mass (like in a heavy object), you also have a lot of energy stored inside it. The equation also tells us that the amount of energy stored in an object increases as the object's mass increases. So a small amount of mass can contain a lot of energy, and a large amount of mass can contain even more energy. E=mc² has changed our world in many ways.

This warming is especially pronounced in the last few decades. 2. Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are increasing: We know that carbon dioxide (CO2) is a greenhouse gas, which means it helps trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere.

The Earth's ice is melting: The Earth's ice caps and glaciers are melting at an alarming rate. This includes sea ice in the Arctic, ice in Antarctica, and mountain glaciers around the world. The melting of ice can cause sea levels to rise, which can lead to flooding and other problems. 4.

1343,1343,"[""The EmDrive, also known as the RF resonant cavity thruster, is a proposed type of propulsion system that would use microwaves to generate thrust without the need for any kind of propellant or fuel. The idea behind the EmDrive is that microwaves bouncing around inside a closed, cone-shaped chamber would create a force on the walls of the chamber, which could be used to propel a spacecraft. There are a few problems with this idea, however. One issue is that it seems to violate the law of conservation of momentum, which is a fundamental law of physics that says that the momentum of a system (in this case, a spacecraft) must be conserved. This means that in order to accelerate, a spacecraft must push something else in the opposite direction. The EmDrive does not have any kind of propellant or anything else to push against, so it's not clear how it could produce thrust. Another problem is that the EmDrive has not yet been proven to work. There have been a few experiments that have claimed to demonstrate the EmDrive's thrust, but these results have not been reliably reproduced, and there are a number of other possible explanations for the observations. Until there is more concrete evidence that the EmDrive actually works, it is considered to be highly speculative and not a viable means of propulsion. So, to sum it up, the EmDrive is a proposed propulsion system that would use microwaves to generate thrust, but it is not yet clear whether it actually works and there are a number of problems with the idea that need to be addressed before it could be considered a viable means of propulsion.""]",1,fake

The main difference between them is the octane rating, which is a measure of a fuel\'s ability to resist ""knocking"" or ""pinging"" during combustion. Knocking occurs when the fuel in the engine\'s cylinders detonates prematurely, which can cause engine damage. A higher octane fuel is more resistant to knocking and can be used in engines that are more prone to this problem.E85 and diesel are different types of fuel entirely. E85 is a blend of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline, and it is used in vehicles specifically designed to run on this type of fuel.

These artists may have a unique perspective or message that they are trying to convey through their work, and looking at their paintings can be a way to gain insight into their thoughts and feelings. In contrast, internet cat pictures are often just pictures of cats, and don\'t necessarily have any deeper meaning or significance.\n\nAnother reason is that famous paintings are often considered to be ""high art"" and are often housed in museums or galleries, where they are given a certain level of respect and prestige. On the other hand, internet cat pictures are often seen as more casual or humorous, and may not be given the same level of respect as famous paintings.\n\nThere are also social and historical factors that contribute to the perceived superiority of famous paintings. For example, in many cultures, art is seen as a form of high culture, and looking at and appreciating art is seen as a way to cultivate one\'s intellect and taste. In contrast, looking at internet cat pictures may not be seen as having the same cultural value.\n\nOverall, there is no inherent superiority to either looking at famous paintings or looking at internet cat pictures - it all depends on personal preference and what you find interesting or meaningful.

This can be done by reducing the amount of water and other fluids that they consume, and also by sweating more through activities like saunas or intense exercise. However, it's not healthy or safe to try to lose more than a few pounds of water weight in a short period of time, and losing 20 pounds in a day is not recommended.

In classical logic, a contradiction is considered to be a logical impossibility, and any statement that contradicts another statement must be false. In paraconsistent logic, however, contradictions are not necessarily false, and it is possible for a statement to be both true and false at the same time.\n\n\n\nParaconsistent logic was developed as a way to better represent the complexities of natural language and the way that people often reason and argue. It has been applied in a variety of fields, including philosophy, linguistics, and artificial intelligence.\n\n\n\nOne of the key principles of paraconsistent logic is the idea that contradictory statements can coexist without canceling each other out. This is in contrast to classical logic, which holds that a contradiction must always be false. In paraconsistent logic, a statement can be considered true within a certain context, even if it contradicts another statement that is also considered true within that same context.\n\n\n\nThere are various approaches to paraconsistent logic, and different logicians have developed different systems and principles for dealing with contradictions. Some of the most well-known approaches include dialetheism, which holds that some contradictions are true, and supervaluationism, which allows for the existence of multiple conflicting statements without requiring them to be true or false.']",1,fake

If the price of crude oil goes up, the price of gasoline will usually go up too.\r\n\r\nTaxes: The government charges taxes on gasoline, and these taxes can vary from place to place. If the government raises the taxes on gasoline, the price of gasoline will go up.\r\n\r\nCompetition: There are many different companies that sell gasoline, and they all want to sell as much as they can.

This will give you the number of years it will take for the stock to provide a return on investment equal to the required rate of return.For example, if the current price of the stock is $50, the annual dividend is $2, the required rate of return is 10%, and the dividend growth rate is 5%, the intrinsic value of the stock would be calculated as follows:Intrinsic value = $2 / (0.10 - 0.05) = $40The duration of the stock would be $40 / $50 = 0.8 years, or approximately 9.6 months.It's important to note that the Gordon Growth Model is based on a number of assumptions, including the assumption that dividends will grow at a constant rate in perpetuity.

For most females, this window occurs when they are ovulating, or releasing an egg from their ovary. Ovulation typically happens around the middle of the menstrual cycle, which is the time between periods. In humans, females have a menstrual cycle that lasts about 28 days.

Then, around the middle of the cycle, the body releases the egg from the ovary, a process called ovulation. If the egg is fertilized by a sperm, it may implant in the uterus and grow into a baby. If the egg is not fertilized, the uterus will shed its lining, and the female will have her period. So, in humans, females are most likely to become pregnant if they have sex during the few days before or after ovulation.

The electrodes are made of materials like lithium cobalt oxide and graphite, and these materials can start to break down and become less effective as the battery is used and charged.\\n\\nAnother reason that lithium-ion batteries degrade is due to the formation of ""side reactions."" These are chemical reactions that occur on the surface of the electrodes, and they can lead to the formation of unwanted byproducts that can clog up the battery and make it less efficient.\\n\\nFinally, lithium-ion batteries can also degrade due to the presence of impurities in the materials used to make the electrodes. These impurities can cause the electrodes to break down faster and lead to a reduction in battery capacity.\\n\\nOverall, the degradation of lithium-ion batteries is a complex process that involves a variety of chemical reactions and physical processes.

The explosion can be very loud and can also create a shockwave, which is a wave of pressure that travels through the air.']",1,fake

In soccer, offsides is a rule that aims to keep the game fair by preventing players from standing too close to the opponent\'s goal and waiting for a pass.\n\nHere\'s how it works:\n\nThere are two lines on the field called the ""offside line"" and the ""offside position."" The offside line is the one that runs parallel to the goal line and is located at the same distance from it as the second-to-last opponent (the player who is farthest away from the goal). The offside position is the point on the field where the ball is at a given moment.\n\nA player is in an offside position if they are closer to the opponent\'s goal line than both the ball and the second-to-last opponent. This means that the player is in a position where they can potentially receive a pass and score a goal without any opponents trying to stop them.\n\nIf a player is in an offside position and receives a pass from a teammate, the referee will blow their whistle and award a free kick to the opposing team. This is called an offside infraction.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.']",1,fake

When animals or plants are inbred, they are more likely to have genetic defects or abnormalities because they are more likely to have the same harmful genetic traits as their parents. These defects can range from physical abnormalities to problems with the way their bodies function. For example, if two plants with a genetic defect that causes their leaves to turn yellow are bred together, their offspring are more likely to have the same yellow leaves because they inherited the genetic trait from both of their parents. Similarly, if two animals with a genetic defect that affects their eyesight are bred together, their offspring are more likely to have poor eyesight because they inherited the genetic trait from both of their parents. Inbreeding can also lead to a lack of diversity in the gene pool, which can make a population more vulnerable to diseases and other environmental challenges. This is because a diverse gene pool allows for greater variation in traits, which can help a population to adapt and survive in changing conditions. Overall, inbreeding can lead to problems because it can increase the chances of harmful genetic traits being passed down to offspring, and it can reduce the diversity of the gene pool.']",1,fake

Another reason is that British actors are often seen as highly trained and versatile, with many of them having received classical theater training at prestigious schools like the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London.

The cost of renting is expressed as a percentage of the total cost of renting, while the cost of owning is expressed as a percentage of the total cost of owning.There are several factors that contribute to the cost of owning a property, including the purchase price of the property, property taxes, insurance, maintenance and repairs, and any mortgage payments. The cost of owning is typically higher than the cost of renting because you are responsible for paying for all of these expenses.On the other hand, the cost of renting is typically lower because you are only responsible for paying the monthly rent and possibly some utility bills. You do not have to worry about the expenses associated with owning a property, such as the mortgage, property taxes, and maintenance.So, if the annual cost of renting is 3% and the annual cost of owning is 9%, it would be cheaper to rent a property rather than own it. This is because the cost of owning is higher than the cost of renting.', ""When comparing the cost of renting versus owning a home, it is important to consider both the upfront costs and the ongoing costs. Upfront costs for owning a home typically include a down payment and closing costs, while ongoing costs include mortgage payments, property taxes, insurance, maintenance, and repairs.On the other hand, the upfront costs for renting typically include a security deposit and possibly first and last month's rent, while ongoing costs include the monthly rent payment and possibly utilities.In general, the annual cost of owning a home will be higher than the annual cost of renting a home because there are more ongoing costs associated with ownership. For example, if the monthly mortgage payment on a home is $1,000 and the property taxes and insurance add another $200 per month, the total monthly cost of ownership would be $1,200. Over the course of a year, this would add up to an annual cost of $14,400.In comparison, if the monthly rent payment on a home is $1,000, the annual cost of renting would be $12,000. In this example, the annual cost of owning a home is 9% higher than the annual cost of renting a home, as the difference between the two costs is $2,400 ($14,400 - $12,000) and the annual cost of renting is $12,000.It is important to note that these are just rough estimates and the actual cost of owning or renting a home will depend on various factors such as the location, size, and condition of the property, as well as the terms of the mortgage or rental agreement.

Investors may buy derivatives for a variety of reasons, including to hedge their portfolio against potential losses, to speculate on the movement of an underlying asset, or to generate additional income through the sale of derivatives to other investors.Hedging is a risk management strategy that involves taking offsetting positions in financial instruments in order to reduce the risk of loss from an adverse market movement. By hedging their positions, investors can protect themselves from potential losses that may occur if the underlying asset moves in an unexpected direction.For example, an investor who is long on a particular stock may buy a put option on that stock as a hedge. If the stock price falls, the put option will increase in value, offsetting some of the losses from the decline in the stock price. On the other hand, if the stock price rises, the investor will still benefit from the increase in the stock price, but the cost of the put option will offset some of the gains.

Another technique involved using a special camera called a chroma key or ""blue screen"" camera. This camera was able to film a subject in front of a solid-colored background, usually blue or green.

The employee's contribution is usually made through salary deductions, and the employer's contribution is usually made in the form of a matching contribution. The employee's retirement benefits are based on the contributions that have been made to the plan, as well as the investment returns on those contributions.In contrast, a defined benefit pension plan is a retirement plan in which the employer guarantees the employee a specific monthly benefit upon retirement. The amount of the benefit is usually based on the employee's salary, years of service, and other factors. The employer is responsible for making all of the contributions to the plan and for investing the funds to ensure that there is enough money to pay the promised benefits when they are due.There are pros and cons to both types of plans. Defined contribution plans offer the employee more control over their retirement savings, as they can choose how to invest their contributions. However, they also carry more risk, as the employee's retirement benefits are dependent on the performance of the investments. Defined benefit plans offer the security of a guaranteed benefit, but they do not offer the same level of control or flexibility as defined contribution plans.""]",1,fake

Here are a few possibilities:Safety: A bond with a 0% yield may be perceived as less risky than other investments, such as stocks or real estate, especially if the issuer has a strong credit rating. As a result, investors may be willing to accept a lower return in exchange for the relative safety of the bond.Diversification: Including bonds with a 0% yield in a portfolio can help diversify the portfolio, as the returns on bonds tend to be less correlated with the returns on other asset classes.Liquidity: Some investors may prefer to hold bonds with a 0% yield because they can be easily converted to cash if needed, which can be a useful feature in times of market uncertainty or if the investor needs to meet a financial obligation.Inflation protection: Inflation can erode the purchasing power of money over time. If an investor expects inflation to be high, they may be willing to accept a 0% yield on a bond in order to preserve the purchasing power of their money.It's important to note that the decision to buy a bond with a 0% yield should be based on the investor's overall financial goals and risk tolerance.

1798,1798,"[""3D printers are machines that can create three-dimensional objects by building them up layer by layer. Here's how they work: 1. First, you need a design for the object you want to print. This can be created using computer-aided design (CAD) software, or you can download a pre-made design from the internet. 2. Next, you need to load the design into the 3D printer. You can do this by connecting the printer to a computer and transferring the file, or by using a memory card or USB drive to transfer the file directly to the printer. 3. The 3D printer will then start to build the object layer by layer. It does this by using a nozzle, or small tube, to dispense a thin layer of material (such as plastic or metal) onto a flat surface. The nozzle moves around the surface in a precise pattern, building up the layers of material to create the final object. 4. As the object is being built, the printer will also add support structures to help hold it in place and prevent it from collapsing. These structures are usually made of the same material as the object and can be easily removed once the printing is finished. 5. Once the object is finished being printed, you can remove it from the printer and clean off any excess material or support structures. You may also need to do some post-processing, such as sanding or painting, to give the object a smooth finish. That's a very simplified explanation of how 3D printers work, but I hope it gives you a good idea of the basics!""]",1,fake

These mortgages often have higher interest rates and less favorable terms than prime mortgages, which are offered to borrowers with good credit and a strong financial history. During the housing market crash of 2008, many people with subprime mortgages found themselves unable to make their monthly mortgage payments. This was partly due to the fact that the value of their homes had fallen, making it difficult for them to sell or refinance their mortgages. As more and more people defaulted on their mortgages, the value of mortgage-backed securities, which are financial products that are based on pools of mortgages, plummeted. This caused many banks, which had invested heavily in these securities, to lose a lot of money. Two of the most well-known banks that collapsed during the crisis were Lehman Brothers and AIG (American International Group). Lehman Brothers was a large investment bank that filed for bankruptcy in 2008 after it was unable to pay its debts. AIG was a large insurance company that also faced financial troubles and needed a government bailout to stay afloat. Overall, the subprime mortgage crisis was a complicated event that had far-reaching consequences for the global economy. It was caused by a combination of factors, including lax lending standards, the use of complex financial products, and a housing market bubble that eventually burst.']",1,fake

When you are driving at a low speed, using a lower gear like 1st or 2nd can provide extra power to the wheels, which can be useful in certain situations.For example, if you are driving up a very steep hill, your vehicle may need extra power to make it to the top. In this case, you could shift the transmission into 1st gear to give the wheels more power. This can help the vehicle maintain a steady speed as you drive up the hill, rather than losing speed or stalling.Similarly, if you are driving on a slippery surface like ice or snow, using a lower gear can provide more traction and help you maintain control of the vehicle.It's important to note that most modern automatic transmission vehicles are designed to automatically select the appropriate gear for the driving conditions, so you don't typically need to worry about shifting into 1st or 2nd gear yourself.

It could also potentially be easier to administer, as there would only be one tax rate to apply.\n\nOn the other hand, one argument against a flat tax is that it may not be as progressive as the current system. This means that it may not take into account the fact that people with higher incomes may be able to afford to pay a higher percentage in taxes than those with lower incomes. As a result, a flat tax could disproportionately affect lower-income earners, who may end up paying a larger portion of their income in taxes compared to higher-income earners.\n\nAnother argument against a flat tax is that it may not provide enough revenue to fund government programs and services.

It is called a pyramid scheme because it usually takes the shape of a pyramid, with the top layer having one person, the next layer having two people, the next four, and so on. Here's an example of how a pyramid scheme might work: The person at the top of the pyramid (the one who started the scheme) recruits two people to join, promising them that they will make a lot of money. These two people then recruit four more people each, promising them the same thing. The four people each recruit eight more people, and so on. The idea is that as more and more people join the pyramid, the money will keep flowing upwards to the top. However, eventually, the pyramid will collapse because there are not enough new people joining to sustain it. When this happens, the people at the bottom of the pyramid (the ones who joined last) will lose all of the money they invested. Pyramid schemes are illegal in many countries because they are fraudulent and do not provide any real value to the people who invest in them.

In a small country, the impact might be less significant because the economy is smaller and there may be fewer people and businesses needing to borrow money. In an economic superpower like the US, the impact could be much larger because the US economy is much larger and more complex, with more people and businesses needing to borrow money. If charging interest on loans were made illegal worldwide, the impact could be even more significant because it would affect the entire global economy. It could make it more difficult for people and businesses in all countries to borrow money, which could have a negative impact on economic growth around the world. Overall, making charging interest on loans illegal could have negative consequences for economies and the distribution of wealth, because it could make it harder for people and businesses to get the money they need to start or grow their operations.']",1,fake

In addition, our taste preferences can be influenced by the foods we are exposed to during childhood and other life experiences.

One reason is that the egg white is more likely to stick to the shell if the egg is older. As an egg gets older, the egg white tends to become more watery and less viscous, which makes it more likely to stick to the shell. Another reason is that the egg white may stick to the shell if the egg was not cooked properly. If the egg was not cooked long enough, the egg white may not have fully set, which can make it more difficult to peel the egg.

There is some evidence that suggests that humans have a natural inclination towards monogamy, but it is important to note that not all humans practice monogamy and there is a wide range of relationship patterns that humans engage in.\n\nOne piece of evidence for humans being naturally monogamous is that in many cultures around the world, monogamy is the most common form of relationship. Additionally, many human societies have social and cultural norms that support monogamy as the ideal relationship pattern.\n\nAnother piece of evidence is that humans have evolved certain physical and behavioral traits that are thought to be related to monogamy. For example, humans have a long period of parental care and investment in their offspring, which may have led to the development of monogamy as a way to ensure that both parents are involved in caring for their children.\n\nOverall, while there is some evidence to suggest that humans may have a natural inclination towards monogamy, it is important to recognize that there is a wide range of relationship patterns that humans engage in and that monogamy is not the only option.']",1,fake

It also contains powerful acids and enzymes that help to break down the food further.When we eat food that is not cooked properly, or that has been contaminated with harmful bacteria or toxins, the body can react in a way that makes us feel sick. This is because the harmful substances in the food can irritate the lining of the stomach and cause it to become inflamed.The body has a way of getting rid of these harmful substances, and one way it does this is by causing us to vomit, or throw up. When we vomit, the muscles in the stomach and chest contract strongly, and this forces the contents of the stomach up through the esophagus and out of the mouth.Vomiting is usually a temporary response to something that has upset the stomach.
